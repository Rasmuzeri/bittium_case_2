Class ScriptEngineManager
java.lang.Object
javax.script.ScriptEngineManager
public class
ScriptEngineManager
extends
Object
The
ScriptEngineManager
implements a discovery and instantiation
 mechanism for
ScriptEngine
classes and also maintains a
 collection of key/value pairs storing state shared by all engines created
 by the Manager. This class uses the service provider mechanism described in the
ServiceLoader
class to enumerate all the
 implementations of
ScriptEngineFactory
.
The
ScriptEngineManager
provides a method to return a list of all these factories
 as well as utility methods which look up factories on the basis of language name, file extension
 and mime type.
The
Bindings
of key/value pairs, referred to as the "Global Scope"  maintained
 by the manager is available to all instances of
ScriptEngine
created
 by the
ScriptEngineManager
.  The values in the
Bindings
are
 generally exposed in all scripts.

Constructor Details
ScriptEngineManager
public
ScriptEngineManager
()
The effect of calling this constructor is the same as calling
ScriptEngineManager(Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader())
.

Thread.getContextClassLoader()
ScriptEngineManager
public
ScriptEngineManager
(
ClassLoader
loader)
This constructor loads the implementations of
ScriptEngineFactory
visible to the given
ClassLoader
using the service provider mechanism.
If loader is
null
, the script engine factories that are
 bundled with the platform are loaded.
Parameters:
loader
- ClassLoader used to discover script engine factories.
Method Details
setBindings
public
void
setBindings
(
Bindings
bindings)
setBindings
stores the specified
Bindings
in the
globalScope
field. ScriptEngineManager sets this
Bindings
as global bindings for
ScriptEngine
objects created by it.
Parameters:
bindings
- The specified
Bindings
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if bindings is null.
getBindings
public
Bindings
getBindings
()
getBindings
returns the value of the
globalScope
field.
 ScriptEngineManager sets this
Bindings
as global bindings for
ScriptEngine
objects created by it.
Returns:
The globalScope field.
put
public
void
put
(
String
key,
Object
value)
Sets the specified key/value pair in the Global Scope.
Parameters:
key
- Key to set
value
- Value to set.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if key is null.
IllegalArgumentException
- if key is empty string.
get
public
Object
get
(
String
key)
Gets the value for the specified key in the Global Scope
Parameters:
key
- The key whose value is to be returned.
Returns:
The value for the specified key.
getEngineByName
public
ScriptEngine
getEngineByName
(
String
shortName)
Looks up and creates a
ScriptEngine
for a given  name.
 The algorithm first searches for a
ScriptEngineFactory
that has been
 registered as a handler for the specified name using the
registerEngineName
method.
If one is not found, it searches the set of
ScriptEngineFactory
instances
 stored by the constructor for one with the specified name.  If a
ScriptEngineFactory
is found by either method, it is used to create instance of
ScriptEngine
.
Parameters:
shortName
- The short name of the
ScriptEngine
implementation.
 returned by the
getNames
method of its
ScriptEngineFactory
.
Returns:
A
ScriptEngine
created by the factory located in the search.  Returns null
 if no such factory was found.  The
ScriptEngineManager
sets its own
globalScope
Bindings
as the
GLOBAL_SCOPE
Bindings
of the newly
 created
ScriptEngine
.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if shortName is null.
getEngineByExtension
public
ScriptEngine
getEngineByExtension
(
String
extension)
Look up and create a
ScriptEngine
for a given extension.  The algorithm
 used by
getEngineByName
is used except that the search starts
 by looking for a
ScriptEngineFactory
registered to handle the
 given extension using
registerEngineExtension
.
Parameters:
extension
- The given extension
Returns:
The engine to handle scripts with this extension.  Returns
null
if not found.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if extension is null.
getEngineByMimeType
public
ScriptEngine
getEngineByMimeType
(
String
mimeType)
Look up and create a
ScriptEngine
for a given mime type.  The algorithm
 used by
getEngineByName
is used except that the search starts
 by looking for a
ScriptEngineFactory
registered to handle the
 given mime type using
registerEngineMimeType
.
Parameters:
mimeType
- The given mime type
Returns:
The engine to handle scripts with this mime type.  Returns
null
if not found.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if mimeType is null.
