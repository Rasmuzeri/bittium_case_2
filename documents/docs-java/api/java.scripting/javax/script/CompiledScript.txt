Class CompiledScript
java.lang.Object
javax.script.CompiledScript
public abstract class
CompiledScript
extends
Object
Extended by classes that store results of compilations.  State
 might be stored in the form of Java classes, Java class files or scripting
 language opcodes.  The script may be executed repeatedly
 without reparsing.
Each
CompiledScript
is associated with a
ScriptEngine
-- A call to an
eval
method of the
CompiledScript
causes the execution of the script by the
ScriptEngine
.  Changes in the state of the
ScriptEngine
caused by execution
 of the
CompiledScript
may visible during subsequent executions of scripts by the engine.
Since:

eval
public abstract
Object
eval
(
ScriptContext
context)
throws
ScriptException
Executes the program stored in this
CompiledScript
object.
Parameters:
context
- A
ScriptContext
that is used in the same way as
 the
ScriptContext
passed to the
eval
methods of
ScriptEngine
.
Returns:
The value returned by the script execution, if any.  Should return
null
if no value is returned by the script execution.
Throws:
ScriptException
- if an error occurs.
NullPointerException
- if context is null.
eval
public
Object
eval
(
Bindings
bindings)
throws
ScriptException
Executes the program stored in the
CompiledScript
object using
 the supplied
Bindings
of attributes as the
ENGINE_SCOPE
of the
 associated
ScriptEngine
during script execution.  If bindings is null,
 then the effect of calling this method is same as that of eval(getEngine().getContext()).
.
 The
GLOBAL_SCOPE
Bindings
,
Reader
and
Writer
associated with the default
ScriptContext
of the associated
ScriptEngine
are used.
Parameters:
bindings
- The bindings of attributes used for the
ENGINE_SCOPE
.
Returns:
The return value from the script execution
Throws:
ScriptException
- if an error occurs.
eval

eval
()
            throws
ScriptException

is used.
 The effect of calling this method is same as that of eval(getEngine().getContext()).
Returns:
The return value from the script execution
Throws:
ScriptException
- if an error occurs.

getEngine
()
Returns the
ScriptEngine
whose
compile
method created this
