Module
java.sql.rowset
Package
javax.sql.rowset.serial
Class SerialJavaObject
java.lang.Object
javax.sql.rowset.serial.SerialJavaObject
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
,
Cloneable
public class
SerialJavaObject
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
,
Cloneable
A serializable mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL
JAVA_OBJECT
value. Assuming the Java object
 implements the
Serializable
interface, this class simply wraps the
 serialization process.
If however, the serialization is not possible because
 the Java object is not immediately serializable, this class will
 attempt to serialize all non-static members to permit the object
 state to be serialized.
 Static or transient fields cannot be serialized; an attempt to serialize
 them will result in a
SerialException
object being thrown.
Thread safety
A SerialJavaObject is not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  If a
 SerialJavaObject is to be used by more than one thread then access to the
 SerialJavaObject should be controlled by appropriate synchronization.
Since:
1.5

Throws:
SerialException
- if an error is encountered accessing
 the serialized object
SecurityException
- If a security manager,
s
, is present
 and the caller's class loader is not the same as or an
 ancestor of the class loader for the class of the
object
being serialized
 and invocation of
s.checkPackageAccess()
denies access to the package
 of that class.

Class.getFields()
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
o)
Compares this SerialJavaObject to the specified object.
 The result is
true
if and only if the argument
 is not
null
and is a
SerialJavaObject
object that is identical to this object
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
o
- The object to compare this
SerialJavaObject
against
Returns:
true
if the given object represents a
SerialJavaObject
equivalent to this SerialJavaObject,
false
otherwise
