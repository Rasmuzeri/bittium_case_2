A serialized mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL
 structured type. Each attribute that is not already serialized
 is mapped to a serialized form, and if an attribute is itself
 a structured type, each of its attributes that is not already
 serialized is mapped to a serialized form.
In addition, the structured type is custom mapped to a class in the
 Java programming language if there is such a mapping, as are
 its attributes, if appropriate.
The
SerialStruct
class provides a constructor for creating
 an instance from a
Struct
object, a method for retrieving
 the SQL type name of the SQL structured type in the database, and methods
 for retrieving its attribute values.
Thread safety
A SerialStruct is not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  If a
 SerialStruct is to be used by more than one thread then access to the
 SerialStruct should be controlled by appropriate synchronization.

throws
SerialException
Constructs a
SerialStruct
object from the given
Struct
object, using the given
java.util.Map
object for custom mapping the SQL structured type or any of its
 attributes that are SQL structured types.
Parameters:
in
- an instance of
Struct
map
- a
java.util.Map
object in which
        each entry consists of 1) a
String
object
        giving the fully qualified name of a UDT and 2) the
Class
object for the
SQLData
implementation
        that defines how the UDT is to be mapped
Throws:
SerialException
- if an error occurs

SerialStruct
public
SerialStruct
(
SQLData
in,
Map
<
String

throws
SerialException
Constructs a
SerialStruct
object from the
 given
SQLData
object, using the given type
 map to custom map it to a class in the Java programming
 language.  The type map gives the SQL type and the class
 to which it is mapped.  The
SQLData
object
 defines the class to which the SQL type will be mapped.
Parameters:
in
- an instance of the
SQLData
class
           that defines the mapping of the SQL structured
           type to one or more objects in the Java programming language
map
- a
java.util.Map
object in which
        each entry consists of 1) a
String
object
        giving the fully qualified name of a UDT and 2) the
Class
object for the
SQLData
implementation
        that defines how the UDT is to be mapped
Throws:
SerialException
- if an error occurs
Method Details

public
String
getSQLTypeName
()
                      throws

Retrieves the SQL type name for this
SerialStruct
object. This is the name used in the SQL definition of the
 structured type
Specified by:
getSQLTypeName
in interface
Struct
Returns:
a
String
object representing the SQL
         type name for the SQL structured type that this

Struct
Returns:
an array of
