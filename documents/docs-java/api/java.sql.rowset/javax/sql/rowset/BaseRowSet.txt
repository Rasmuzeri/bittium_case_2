Package
javax.sql.rowset
Class BaseRowSet
java.lang.Object
javax.sql.rowset.BaseRowSet
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
,
Cloneable
public abstract class
BaseRowSet
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
,
Cloneable
An abstract class providing a
RowSet
object with its basic functionality.
 The basic functions include having properties and sending event notifications,
 which all JavaBeans components must implement.
1.0 Overview
The
BaseRowSet
class provides the core functionality
 for all
RowSet
implementations,
 and all standard implementations
may
use this class in combination with
 one or more
RowSet
interfaces in order to provide a standard
 vendor-specific implementation.  To clarify, all implementations must implement
 at least one of the
RowSet
interfaces (
JdbcRowSet
,
CachedRowSet
,
JoinRowSet
,
FilteredRowSet
,
 or
WebRowSet
). This means that any implementation that extends
 the
BaseRowSet
class must also implement one of the
RowSet
interfaces.
The
BaseRowSet
class provides the following:
Properties
Fields for storing current properties
Methods for getting and setting properties
Event notification
A complete set of setter methods
for setting the parameters in a
RowSet
object's command
Streams
Fields for storing stream instances
Constants for indicating the type of a stream
2.0 Setting Properties
All rowsets maintain a set of properties, which will usually be set using
 a tool.  The number and kinds of properties a rowset has will vary,
 depending on what the
RowSet
implementation does and how it gets
 its data.  For example,
 rowsets that get their data from a
ResultSet
object need to
 set the properties that are required for making a database connection.
 If a
RowSet
object uses the
DriverManager
facility to make a
 connection, it needs to set a property for the JDBC URL that identifies the
 appropriate driver, and it needs to set the properties that give the
 user name and password.
 If, on the other hand, the rowset uses a
DataSource
object
 to make the connection, which is the preferred method, it does not need to
 set the property for the JDBC URL.  Instead, it needs to set the property
 for the logical name of the data source along with the properties for
 the user name and password.
NOTE:  In order to use a
DataSource
object for making a
 connection, the
DataSource
object must have been registered
 with a naming service that uses the Java Naming and Directory
 Interface (JNDI) API.  This registration
 is usually done by a person acting in the capacity of a system administrator.
3.0 Setting the Command and Its Parameters
When a rowset gets its data from a relational database, it executes a command (a query)
 that produces a
ResultSet
object.  This query is the command that is set
 for the
RowSet
object's command property.  The rowset populates itself with data by reading the
 data from the
ResultSet
object into itself. If the query
 contains placeholders for values to be set, the
BaseRowSet
setter methods
 are used to set these values. All setter methods allow these values to be set
 to
null
if required.
The following code fragment illustrates how the
CachedRowSet
object
crs
might have its command property set.  Note that if a
 tool is used to set properties, this is the code that the tool would use.
crs.setCommand("SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS" +
                   "WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > ? AND REGION = ?");
In this example, the values for
CREDIT_LIMIT
and
REGION
are placeholder parameters, which are indicated with a
 question mark (?).  The first question mark is placeholder parameter number
1
, the second question mark is placeholder parameter number
2
, and so on.  Any placeholder parameters must be set with
 values before the query can be executed. To set these
 placeholder parameters, the
BaseRowSet
class provides a set of setter
 methods, similar to those provided by the
PreparedStatement
interface, for setting values of each data type.  A
RowSet
object stores the
 parameter values internally, and its
execute
method uses them internally
 to set values for the placeholder parameters
 before it sends the command to the DBMS to be executed.
The following code fragment demonstrates
 setting the two parameters in the query from the previous example.
crs.setInt(1, 5000);
    crs.setString(2, "West");
If the
execute
method is called at this point, the query
 sent to the DBMS will be:
"SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS" +
                   "WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > 5000 AND REGION = 'West'"
NOTE: Setting
Array
,
Clob
,
Blob
and
Ref
objects as a command parameter, stores these values as
SerialArray
,
SerialClob
,
SerialBlob
and
SerialRef
objects respectively.
4.0 Handling of Parameters Behind the Scenes
NOTE: The
BaseRowSet
class provides two kinds of setter methods,
 those that set properties and those that set placeholder parameters. The setter
 methods discussed in this section are those that set placeholder parameters.
The placeholder parameters set with the
BaseRowSet
setter methods
 are stored as objects in an internal
Hashtable
object.
 Primitives are stored as their
Object
type. For example,
byte
is stored as
Byte
object, and
int
is stored as
 an
Integer
object.
 When the method
execute
is called, the values in the
Hashtable
object are substituted for the appropriate placeholder
 parameters in the command.
A call to the method
getParams
returns the values stored in the
Hashtable
object as an array of
Object
instances.
 An element in this array may be a simple
Object
instance or an
 array (which is a type of
Object
). The particular setter method used
 determines whether an element in this array is an
Object
or an array.
The majority of methods for setting placeholder parameters take two parameters,
  with the first parameter
 indicating which placeholder parameter is to be set, and the second parameter
 giving the value to be set.  Methods such as
setInt
,
setString
,
setBoolean
, and
setLong
fall into
 this category.  After these methods have been called, a call to the method
getParams
will return an array with the values that have been set. Each
 element in the array is an
Object
instance representing the
 values that have been set. The order of these values in the array is determined by the
int
(the first parameter) passed to the setter method. The values in the
 array are the values (the second parameter) passed to the setter method.
 In other words, the first element in the array is the value
 to be set for the first placeholder parameter in the
RowSet
object's
 command. The second element is the value to
 be set for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
Several setter methods send the driver and DBMS information beyond the value to be set.
 When the method
getParams
is called after one of these setter methods has
 been used, the elements in the array will themselves be arrays to accommodate the
 additional information. In this category, the method
setNull
is a special case
 because one version takes only
 two parameters (
setNull(int parameterIndex, int SqlType)
). Nevertheless,
 it requires
 an array to contain the information that will be passed to the driver and DBMS.  The first
 element in this array is the value to be set, which is
null
, and the
 second element is the
int
supplied for
sqlType
, which
 indicates the type of SQL value that is being set to
null
. This information
 is needed by some DBMSs and is therefore required in order to ensure that applications
 are portable.
 The other version is intended to be used when the value to be set to
null
is a user-defined type. It takes three parameters
 (
setNull(int parameterIndex, int sqlType, String typeName)
) and also
 requires an array to contain the information to be passed to the driver and DBMS.
 The first two elements in this array are the same as for the first version of
setNull
.  The third element,
typeName
, gives the SQL name of
 the user-defined type. As is true with the other setter methods, the number of the
 placeholder parameter to be set is indicated by an element's position in the array
 returned by
getParams
.  So, for example, if the parameter
 supplied to
setNull
is
2
, the second element in the array
 returned by
getParams
will be an array of two or three elements.
Some methods, such as
setObject
and
setDate
have versions
 that take more than two parameters, with the extra parameters giving information
 to the driver or the DBMS. For example, the methods
setDate
,
setTime
, and
setTimestamp
can take a
Calendar
object as their third parameter.  If the DBMS does not store time zone information,
 the driver uses the
Calendar
object to construct the
Date
,
Time
, or
Timestamp
object being set. As is true with other
 methods that provide additional information, the element in the array returned
 by
getParams
is an array instead of a simple
Object
instance.
The methods
setAsciiStream
,
setBinaryStream
,
setCharacterStream
, and
setUnicodeStream
(which is
 deprecated, so applications should use
getCharacterStream
instead)
 take three parameters, so for them, the element in the array returned by
getParams
is also an array.  What is different about these setter
 methods is that in addition to the information provided by parameters, the array contains
 one of the
BaseRowSet
constants indicating the type of stream being set.
NOTE: The method
getParams
is called internally by
RowSet
implementations extending this class; it is not normally called by an
 application programmer directly.
5.0 Event Notification
The
BaseRowSet
class provides the event notification
 mechanism for rowsets.  It contains the field
listeners
, methods for adding and removing listeners, and
 methods for notifying listeners of changes.
A listener is an object that has implemented the
RowSetListener
interface.
 If it has been added to a
RowSet
object's list of listeners, it will be notified
  when an event occurs on that
RowSet
object.  Each listener's
 implementation of the
RowSetListener
methods defines what that object
 will do when it is notified that an event has occurred.
There are three possible events for a
RowSet
object:
the cursor moves
an individual row is changed (updated, deleted, or inserted)
the contents of the entire
RowSet
object  are changed
The
BaseRowSet
method used for the notification indicates the
 type of event that has occurred.  For example, the method
notifyRowChanged
indicates that a row has been updated,
 deleted, or inserted.  Each of the notification methods creates a
RowSetEvent
object, which is supplied to the listener in order to
 identify the
RowSet
object on which the event occurred.
 What the listener does with this information, which may be nothing, depends on how it was
 implemented.
6.0 Default Behavior
A default
BaseRowSet
object is initialized with many starting values.

 The following is true of a default
RowSet
instance that extends
 the
BaseRowSet
class:
Has a scrollable cursor and does not show changes
       made by others.
Is updatable.
Does not show rows that have been deleted.
Has no time limit for how long a driver may take to
       execute the
RowSet
object's command.
Has no limit for the number of rows it may contain.
Has no limit for the number of bytes a column may contain. NOTE: This
   limit applies only to columns that hold values of the
   following types:
BINARY
,
VARBINARY
,
LONGVARBINARY
,
CHAR
,
VARCHAR
,
   and
LONGVARCHAR
.
Will not see uncommitted data (make "dirty" reads).
Has escape processing turned on.
Has its connection's type map set to
null
.
Has an empty
Vector
object for storing the values set
       for the placeholder parameters in the
RowSet
object's command.
If other values are desired, an application must set the property values
 explicitly. For example, the following line of code sets the maximum number
 of rows for the
CachedRowSet
object
crs
to 500.
crs.setMaxRows(500);
Methods implemented in extensions of this
BaseRowSet
class
must
throw an
SQLException
object for any violation of the defined assertions.  Also, if the
 extending class overrides and reimplements any
BaseRowSet
method and encounters
 connectivity or underlying data source issues, that method
may
in addition throw an
SQLException
object for that reason.

Constructor Details
BaseRowSet
public
BaseRowSet
()
Constructs a new
BaseRowSet
object initialized with
 a default
Vector
object for its
listeners
field. The other default values with which it is initialized are listed
 in Section 6.0 of the class comment for this class.
Method Details
initParams
protected
void
initParams
()
Performs the necessary internal configurations and initializations
 to allow any JDBC
RowSet
implementation to start using
 the standard facilities provided by a
BaseRowSet
instance. This method
should
be called after the
RowSet
object
 has been instantiated to correctly initialize all parameters. This method
should
never be called by an application, but is called from with
 a
RowSet
implementation extending this class.
addRowSetListener
public
void
addRowSetListener
(
RowSetListener
listener)
The listener will be notified whenever an event occurs on this
RowSet
object.
A listener might, for example, be a table or graph that needs to
 be updated in order to accurately reflect the current state of
 the
RowSet
object.
Note
: if the
RowSetListener
object is
null
, this method silently discards the
null
value and does not add a null reference to the set of listeners.
Note
: if the listener is already set, and the new
RowSetListener
instance is added to the set of listeners already registered to receive
 event notifications from this
RowSet
.
Parameters:
listener
- an object that has implemented the
javax.sql.RowSetListener
interface and wants to be notified
     of any events that occur on this
RowSet
object; May be
     null.
See Also:
removeRowSetListener(javax.sql.RowSetListener)
removeRowSetListener
public
void
removeRowSetListener
(
RowSetListener
listener)
Removes the designated object from this
RowSet
object's list of listeners.
 If the given argument is not a registered listener, this method
 does nothing.
Note
: if the
RowSetListener
object is
null
, this method silently discards the
null
value.
Parameters:
listener
- a
RowSetListener
object that is on the list
        of listeners for this
RowSet
object
See Also:

notifyCursorMoved
protected
void
notifyCursorMoved
()
                          throws
SQLException
Notifies all of the listeners registered with this
RowSet
object that its cursor has moved.
When an application calls a method to move the cursor,
 that method moves the cursor and then calls this method
 internally. An application
should
never invoke
 this method directly.
Throws:
SQLException
- if the class extending the
BaseRowSet
abstract class does not implement the
RowSet
interface or
     one of it's sub-interfaces.
notifyRowChanged
protected
void
notifyRowChanged
()
                         throws
SQLException
Notifies all of the listeners registered with this
RowSet
object that
 one of its rows has changed.
When an application calls a method that changes a row, such as
 the
CachedRowSet
methods
insertRow
,
updateRow
, or
deleteRow
,
 that method calls
notifyRowChanged
internally. An application
should
never invoke
 this method directly.
Throws:
SQLException
- if the class extending the
BaseRowSet
abstract class does not implement the
RowSet
interface or
     one of it's sub-interfaces.
notifyRowSetChanged
protected
void
notifyRowSetChanged
()
                            throws
SQLException
Notifies all of the listeners registered with this
RowSet
object that its entire contents have changed.
When an application calls methods that change the entire contents
 of the
RowSet
object, such as the
CachedRowSet
methods
execute
,
populate
,
restoreOriginal
,
 or
release
, that method calls
notifyRowSetChanged
internally (either directly or indirectly). An application
should
never invoke this method directly.
Throws:
SQLException
- if the class extending the
BaseRowSet
abstract class does not implement the
RowSet
interface or
     one of it's sub-interfaces.
getCommand
public
String
getCommand
()
Retrieves the SQL query that is the command for this
RowSet
object. The command property contains the query that
 will be executed to populate this
RowSet
object.
The SQL query returned by this method is used by
RowSet
methods
 such as
execute
and
populate
, which may be implemented
 by any class that extends the
BaseRowSet
abstract class and
 implements one or more of the standard JSR-114
RowSet
interfaces.
The command is used by the
RowSet
object's
 reader to obtain a
ResultSet
object.  The reader then
 reads the data from the
ResultSet
object and uses it to
 to populate this
RowSet
object.
The default value for the
command
property is
null
.
Returns:
the
String
that is the value for this
RowSet
object's
command
property;
         may be
null
See Also:
setCommand(java.lang.String)
setCommand
public
void
setCommand
(
String
cmd)
throws
SQLException
Sets this
RowSet
object's
command
property to
 the given
String
object and clears the parameters, if any,
 that were set for the previous command.
The
command
property may not be needed if the
RowSet
object gets its data from a source that does not support commands,
 such as a spreadsheet or other tabular file.
 Thus, this property is optional and may be
null
.
Parameters:
cmd
- a
String
object containing an SQL query
            that will be set as this
RowSet
object's command
            property; may be
null
but may not be an empty string
Throws:
SQLException
- if an empty string is provided as the command value
See Also:
getCommand()
getUrl
public
String
getUrl
()
              throws
SQLException
Retrieves the JDBC URL that this
RowSet
object's
javax.sql.Reader
object uses to make a connection
 with a relational database using a JDBC technology-enabled driver.
The
Url
property will be
null
if the underlying data
 source is a non-SQL data source, such as a spreadsheet or an XML
 data source.
Returns:
a
String
object that contains the JDBC URL
         used to establish the connection for this
RowSet
object; may be
null
(default value) if not set
Throws:
SQLException
- if an error occurs retrieving the URL value
See Also:
setUrl(java.lang.String)
setUrl
public
void
setUrl
(
String
url)
throws
SQLException
Sets the Url property for this
RowSet
object
 to the given
String
object and sets the dataSource name
 property to
null
. The Url property is a
 JDBC URL that is used when
 the connection is created using a JDBC technology-enabled driver
 ("JDBC driver") and the
DriverManager
.
 The correct JDBC URL for the specific driver to be used can be found
 in the driver documentation.  Although there are guidelines for how
 a JDBC URL is formed,
 a driver vendor can specify any
String
object except
 one with a length of
0
(an empty string).
Setting the Url property is optional if connections are established using
 a
DataSource
object instead of the
DriverManager
.
 The driver will use either the URL property or the
 dataSourceName property to create a connection, whichever was
 specified most recently. If an application uses a JDBC URL, it
 must load a JDBC driver that accepts the JDBC URL before it uses the
RowSet
object to connect to a database.  The
RowSet
object will use the URL internally to create a database connection in order
 to read or write data.
Parameters:
url
- a
String
object that contains the JDBC URL
     that will be used to establish the connection to a database for this
RowSet
object; may be
null
but must not
     be an empty string
Throws:
SQLException
- if an error occurs setting the Url property or the
     parameter supplied is a string with a length of
0
(an
     empty string)

getUrl()
getDataSourceName
public
String
getDataSourceName
()
Returns the logical name that when supplied to a naming service
 that uses the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API, will
 retrieve a
javax.sql.DataSource
object. This
DataSource
object can be used to establish a connection
 to the data source that it represents.
Users should set either the url or the data source name property.
 The driver will use the property set most recently to establish a
 connection.
Returns:
a
String
object that identifies the
DataSource
object to be used for making a
         connection; if no logical name has been set,
null
is returned.
See Also:
setDataSourceName(java.lang.String)
setDataSourceName
public
void
setDataSourceName
(
String
name)
throws
SQLException
Sets the
DataSource
name property for this
RowSet
object to the given logical name and sets this
RowSet
object's
 Url property to
null
. The name must have been bound to a
DataSource
object in a JNDI naming service so that an
 application can do a lookup using that name to retrieve the
DataSource
object bound to it. The
DataSource
object can then be used to establish a connection to the data source it
 represents.
Users should set either the Url property or the dataSourceName property.
 If both properties are set, the driver will use the property set most recently.
Parameters:
name
- a
String
object with the name that can be supplied
     to a naming service based on JNDI technology to retrieve the
DataSource
object that can be used to get a connection;
     may be
null
but must not be an empty string
Throws:
SQLException
- if an empty string is provided as the
DataSource
name

getTypeMap
public
Map
<
String
,
Class
<?>>
getTypeMap
()
Retrieves the type map associated with the
Connection
object for this
RowSet
object.
Drivers that support the JDBC 3.0 API will create
Connection
objects with an associated type map.
 This type map, which is initially empty, can contain one or more
 fully-qualified SQL names and
Class
objects indicating
 the class to which the named SQL value will be mapped. The type mapping
 specified in the connection's type map is used for custom type mapping
 when no other type map supersedes it.
If a type map is explicitly supplied to a method that can perform
 custom mapping, that type map supersedes the connection's type map.
Returns:
the
java.util.Map
object that is the type map
         for this
RowSet
object's connection
setTypeMap
public
void
setTypeMap
(
Map
<
String
,
Class
<?>> map)
Installs the given
java.util.Map
object as the type map
 associated with the
Connection
object for this
RowSet
object.  The custom mapping indicated in
 this type map will be used unless a different type map is explicitly
 supplied to a method, in which case the type map supplied will be used.
Parameters:
map
- a
java.util.Map
object that contains the
     mapping from SQL type names for user defined types (UDT) to classes in
     the Java programming language.  Each entry in the
Map
object consists of the fully qualified SQL name of a UDT and the
Class
object for the
SQLData
implementation
     of that UDT. May be
null
.

void
setEscapeProcessing
(boolean enable)
throws
SQLException
Sets to the given
boolean
whether or not the driver will
 scan for escape syntax and do escape substitution before sending SQL
 statements to the database. The default is for the driver to do escape
 processing.
Note: Since
PreparedStatement
objects have usually been
 parsed prior to making this call, disabling escape processing for
 prepared statements will likely have no effect.
Parameters:
enable
-
true
to enable escape processing;

()
                       throws
SQLException
Retrieves a
boolean
indicating whether rows marked
 for deletion appear in the set of current rows.
 The default value is
false
.
Note: Allowing deleted rows to remain visible complicates the behavior
 of some of the methods.  However, most
RowSet
object users
 can simply ignore this extra detail because only sophisticated
 applications will likely want to take advantage of this feature.

setFetchDirection
public
void
setFetchDirection
(int direction)
throws
SQLException
Gives the driver a performance hint as to the direction in
 which the rows in this
RowSet
object will be
 processed.  The driver may ignore this hint.
A
RowSet
object inherits the default properties of the
ResultSet
object from which it got its data.  That
ResultSet
object's default fetch direction is set by
 the
Statement
object that created it.
This method applies to a
RowSet
object only while it is
 connected to a database using a JDBC driver.
A
RowSet
object may use this method at any time to change
 its setting for the fetch direction.
Parameters:
direction
- one of
ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD
,
ResultSet.FETCH_REVERSE
, or
ResultSet.FETCH_UNKNOWN
Throws:
SQLException
- if (1) the
RowSet
type is
TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY
and the given fetch direction is not
FETCH_FORWARD
or (2) the given fetch direction is not
     one of the following:
        ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD,
        ResultSet.FETCH_REVERSE, or
        ResultSet.FETCH_UNKNOWN
See Also:
getFetchDirection()

public
int
getFetchDirection
()
                      throws
SQLException
Retrieves this
RowSet
object's current setting for the
 fetch direction. The default type is
ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD
Returns:
one of
ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD
,
ResultSet.FETCH_REVERSE
, or
ResultSet.FETCH_UNKNOWN
Throws:
SQLException
- if an error occurs in determining the
     current fetch direction for fetching rows
See Also:
setFetchDirection(int)
setFetchSize
public
void
setFetchSize
(int rows)
throws
SQLException
Sets the fetch size for this
RowSet
object to the given number of
 rows.  The fetch size gives a JDBC technology-enabled driver ("JDBC driver")
 a hint as to the
 number of rows that should be fetched from the database when more rows
 are needed for this
RowSet
object. If the fetch size specified
 is zero, the driver ignores the value and is free to make its own best guess
 as to what the fetch size should be.
A
RowSet
object inherits the default properties of the
ResultSet
object from which it got its data.  That
ResultSet
object's default fetch size is set by
 the
Statement
object that created it.
This method applies to a
RowSet
object only while it is
 connected to a database using a JDBC driver.
 For connected
RowSet
implementations such as
JdbcRowSet
, this method has a direct and immediate effect
 on the underlying JDBC driver.
A
RowSet
object may use this method at any time to change
 its setting for the fetch size.
For
RowSet
implementations such as
CachedRowSet
, which operate in a disconnected environment,
 the
SyncProvider
object being used
 may leverage the fetch size to poll the data source and
 retrieve a number of rows that do not exceed the fetch size and that may
 form a subset of the actual rows returned by the original query. This is
 an implementation variance determined by the specific
SyncProvider
object employed by the disconnected
RowSet
object.
Parameters:
rows
- the number of rows to fetch;
0
to let the
        driver decide what the best fetch size is; must not be less
        than
0
or more than the maximum number of rows
        allowed for this
RowSet
object (the number returned
        by a call to the method
getMaxRows()
)
Throws:
SQLException
- if the specified fetch size is less than
0
or more than the limit for the maximum number of rows
See Also:
getFetchSize()
getFetchSize
public
int
getFetchSize
()
                 throws
SQLException
Returns the fetch size for this
RowSet
object. The default
 value is zero.
Returns:
the number of rows suggested as the fetch size when this
RowSet
object
     needs more rows from the database
Throws:
SQLException
- if an error occurs determining the number of rows in the
     current fetch size
See Also:
setFetchSize(int)
getConcurrency
public
int
getConcurrency
()
                   throws
SQLException
Returns the concurrency for this
RowSet
object.
 The default is
CONCUR_UPDATABLE
for both connected and
 disconnected
RowSet
objects.
An application can call the method
setConcurrency
at any time
 to change a
RowSet
object's concurrency.
Returns:
the concurrency type for this
RowSet
object, which must be one of the following:
ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY
or
ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE
Throws:
SQLException
- if an error occurs getting the concurrency
     of this
RowSet
object
See Also:
setConcurrency(int)
isReadOnly()
setNull
public
void
setNull
(int parameterIndex,
 int sqlType)
throws
SQLException
Sets the designated parameter to SQL
NULL
.
 Note that the parameter's SQL type must be specified using one of the
 type codes defined in
java.sql.Types
.  This SQL type is
 specified in the second parameter.
Note that the second parameter tells the DBMS the data type of the value being
 set to
NULL
. Some DBMSs require this information, so it is required
 in order to make code more portable.
The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
 will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this
RowSet
object's command when the method
execute
is called.
 Methods such as
execute
and
populate
must be
 provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
 more of the standard JSR-114
RowSet
interfaces.
NOTE:
JdbcRowSet
does not require the
populate
method
 as it is undefined in this class.
Calls made to the method
getParams
after this version of
setNull
has been called will return an
Object
array containing the parameter values that
 have been set.  In that array, the element that represents the values
 set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
 is
null
.
 The second element is the value set for
sqlType
.
 The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
 returned by the method
getParams
,
 with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
 second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
 In other words, if the second placeholder parameter is being set to
null
, the array containing it will be the second element in
 the array returned by
getParams
.
Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
 the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number
parameterIndex
is
parameterIndex
-1.
Parameters:
parameterIndex
- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
        in this
RowSet
object's command that is to be set.
        The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be
1
or greater
sqlType
- an
int
that is one of the SQL type codes
        defined in the class
Types
. If a non-standard
sqlType
is supplied, this method will not throw a
SQLException
. This allows implicit support for
        non-standard SQL types.
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs or the given
        parameter index is out of bounds
See Also:
getParams()
setNull
public
void
setNull
(int parameterIndex,
 int sqlType,
String
typeName)
throws
SQLException
Sets the designated parameter to SQL
NULL
.

 Although this version of the  method
setNull
is intended
 for user-defined
 and
REF
parameters, this method may be used to set a null
 parameter for any JDBC type. The following are user-defined types:
STRUCT
,
DISTINCT
, and
JAVA_OBJECT
,
 and named array types.
Note:
To be portable, applications must give the
 SQL type code and the fully qualified SQL type name when specifying
 a
NULL
user-defined or
REF
parameter.
 In the case of a user-defined type, the name is the type name of
 the parameter itself.  For a
REF
parameter, the name is
 the type name of the referenced type.  If a JDBC technology-enabled
 driver does not need the type code or type name information,
 it may ignore it.
If the parameter does not have a user-defined or
REF
type,
 the given
typeName
parameter is ignored.
The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
 will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this
RowSet
object's command when the method
execute
is called.
 Methods such as
execute
and
populate
must be
 provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
 more of the standard JSR-114
RowSet
interfaces.
NOTE:
JdbcRowSet
does not require the
populate
method
 as it is undefined in this class.
Calls made to the method
getParams
after this version of
setNull
has been called will return an
Object
array containing the parameter values that
 have been set.  In that array, the element that represents the values
 set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
 is
null
.
 The second element is the value set for
sqlType
, and the third
 element is the value set for
typeName
.
 The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
 returned by the method
getParams
,
 with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
 second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
 In other words, if the second placeholder parameter is being set to
null
, the array containing it will be the second element in
 the array returned by
getParams
.
Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
 the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number
parameterIndex
is
parameterIndex
-1.
Parameters:
parameterIndex
- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
        in this
RowSet
object's command that is to be set.
        The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be
1
or greater
sqlType
- a value from
java.sql.Types
typeName
- the fully qualified name of an SQL user-defined type,
                 which is ignored if the parameter is not a user-defined
                 type or
REF
value
Throws:
SQLException
- if an error occurs or the given parameter index
            is out of bounds

 The contents of the stream will be read and sent to the database.
 This method throws an
SQLException
object if the number of bytes
 read and sent to the database is not equal to
length
.
When a very large ASCII value is input to a
LONGVARCHAR
parameter, it may be more practical to send it via a
java.io.InputStream
object. A JDBC technology-enabled
 driver will read the data from the stream as needed until it reaches
 end-of-file. The driver will do any necessary conversion from ASCII to
 the database
CHAR
format.
Note:
This stream object can be either a standard
 Java stream object or your own subclass that implements the
 standard interface.
The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
 will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this
RowSet
object's command when the method
execute
is called.
 Methods such as
execute
and

does not require the
populate
method
 as it is undefined in this class.
Calls made to the method
getParams
after
setAsciiStream
has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that
 have been set.  The element in the array that represents the values
 set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
 is the given
java.io.InputStream
object.
 The second element is the value set for
length
.
 The third element is an internal
BaseRowSet
constant
 specifying that the stream passed to this method is an ASCII stream.
 The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
 returned by the method
getParams
,
 with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
 second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
 In other words, if the input stream being set is the value for the second
 placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in
 the array returned by
getParams
.
Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
 the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number
parameterIndex
is element number
parameterIndex
-1.
Parameters:
parameterIndex
- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
        in this
RowSet
object's command that is to be set.
        The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be
1
or greater
x
- the Java input stream that contains the ASCII parameter value
length
- the number of bytes in the stream. This is the number of bytes
       the driver will send to the DBMS; lengths of 0 or less are
       are undefined but will cause an invalid length exception to be
       thrown in the underlying JDBC driver.
Throws:
SQLException
- if an error occurs, the parameter index is out of bounds,
       or when connected to a data source, the number of bytes the driver reads
       and sends to the database is not equal to the number of bytes specified
       in
length

Sets the designated parameter in this
RowSet
object's command
 to the given input stream.
 When a very large ASCII value is input to a
LONGVARCHAR
parameter, it may be more practical to send it via a
java.io.InputStream
. Data will be read from the stream
 as needed until end-of-file is reached.  The JDBC driver will
 do any necessary conversion from ASCII to the database char format.
Note:
This stream object can either be a standard

length
.
 The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
 returned by the method
getParams
,
 with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
 second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
 In other words, if the reader being set is the value for the second
 placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in
 the array returned by
getParams
.
Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
 the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number
parameterIndex
is element number
parameterIndex
-1.
Parameters:
parameterIndex
- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
        in this
RowSet
object's command that is to be set.
        The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be
1
or greater
reader
- the
Reader
object that contains the
        Unicode data
length
- the number of characters in the stream; lengths of 0 or
        less are undefined but will cause an invalid length exception to
        be thrown in the underlying JDBC driver.
Throws:
SQLException
- if an error occurs, the parameter index is out of bounds,
        or when connected to a data source, the number of bytes the driver
        reads and sends to the database is not equal to the number of bytes
        specified in
length

throws
SQLException
Sets the designated parameter in this
RowSet
object's command
 to the given
Reader
object.
 When a very large UNICODE value is input to a
LONGVARCHAR
parameter, it may be more practical to send it via a
java.io.Reader
object. The data will be read from the stream
 as needed until end-of-file is reached.  The JDBC driver will
 do any necessary conversion from UNICODE to the database char format.
Note:
This stream object can either be a standard
 Java stream object or your own subclass that implements the
 standard interface.
Note:
Consult your JDBC driver documentation to determine if
 it might be more efficient to use a version of
setCharacterStream
which takes a length parameter.
Parameters:
parameterIndex
- the first parameter is 1, the second is 2, ...
reader
- the
java.io.Reader
object that contains the
        Unicode data
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs or
 this method is called on a closed
PreparedStatement
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
- if the JDBC driver does not support this method

setObject
public
void
setObject
(int parameterIndex,
Object
x,
 int targetSqlType,
 int scale)
throws
SQLException
Sets the designated parameter to an
Object
in the Java
 programming language. The second parameter must be an
Object
type.  For integral values, the
java.lang
equivalent
 objects should be used. For example, use the class
Integer
for an
int
.
The driver converts this object to the specified
 target SQL type before sending it to the database.
 If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing
SQLData
), the driver should call the method
SQLData.writeSQL
to write the object to the SQL
 data stream. If, on the other hand, the object is of a class
 implementing
Ref
,
Blob
,
Clob
,
Struct
, or
Array
,
 the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the
 corresponding SQL type.
Note that this method may be used to pass database-
 specific abstract data types.
The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
 will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this
RowSet
object's command when the method
execute
is called.
 Methods such as
execute
and
populate
must be
 provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or
 more of the standard JSR-114
RowSet
interfaces.
NOTE:
JdbcRowSet
does not require the
populate
method
 as it is undefined in this class.
Calls made to the method
getParams
after this version of
setObject
has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that
 have been set.  In that array, the element that represents the values
 set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
 is the given
Object
instance, and the
 second element is the value set for
targetSqlType
.  The
 third element is the value set for
scale
, which the driver will
 ignore if the type of the object being set is not
java.sql.Types.NUMERIC
or
java.sql.Types.DECIMAL
.
 The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
 returned by the method
getParams
,
 with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
 second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
 In other words, if the object being set is the value for the second
 placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in
 the array returned by
getParams
.
Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
 the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number
parameterIndex
is element number
parameterIndex
-1.
Parameters:
parameterIndex
- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
        in this
RowSet

Sets the value of the designated parameter with the given
Object
value.
 This method is like
setObject(int parameterIndex, Object x, int
 targetSqlType, int scale)
except that it assumes a scale of zero.
The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
 will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this
RowSet
object's command when the method

 as it is undefined in this class.
Calls made to the method
getParams
after this version of
setObject
has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that
 have been set.  In that array, the element that represents the values
 set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array
 is the given
Object

.
 The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array
 returned by the method
getParams
,
 with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the
 second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
 In other words, if the object being set is the value for the second
 placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in
 the array returned by
getParams
.
Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
 the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number
parameterIndex
is element number
parameterIndex
-1.
Parameters:
parameterIndex
- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
        in this
RowSet
object's command that is to be set.
        The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

throws
SQLException
Sets the designated parameter to an
Object
in the Java
 programming language. The second parameter must be an
Object
type.  For integral values, the
java.lang
equivalent
 objects should be used. For example, use the class
Integer
for an
int
.
The JDBC specification defines a standard mapping from
 Java
Object
types to SQL types.  The driver will
 use this standard mapping to  convert the given object
 to its corresponding SQL type before sending it to the database.
 If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing
SQLData
), the driver should call the method
SQLData.writeSQL
to write the object to the SQL
 data stream.
If, on the other hand, the object is of a class
 implementing
Ref
,
Blob
,
Clob
,
Struct
, or
Array
,
 the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the
 corresponding SQL type.
This method throws an exception if there
 is an ambiguity, for example, if the object is of a class
 implementing more than one interface.
Note that this method may be used to pass database-specific
 abstract data types.
The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and
 will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this
RowSet

 second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.
 In other words, if the timestamp being set is the value for the second
 placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in
 the array returned by
getParams
.
Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero,
 the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number
parameterIndex
is
parameterIndex
-1.
Parameters:
parameterIndex
- the ordinal number of the placeholder parameter
        in this
RowSet
object's command that is to be set.
        The first parameter is 1, the second is 2, and so on; must be

Clears all of the current parameter values in this
RowSet
object's internal representation of the parameters to be set in
 this
RowSet
object's command when it is executed.
In general, parameter values remain in force for repeated use in
 this
RowSet
object's command. Setting a parameter value with the
 setter methods automatically clears the value of the
 designated parameter and replaces it with the new specified value.
This method is called internally by the
setCommand
method to clear all of the parameters set for the previous command.
Furthermore, this method differs from the
initParams
method in that it maintains the schema of the
RowSet
object.

()
                   throws
SQLException
Retrieves an array containing the parameter values (both Objects and
 primitives) that have been set for this
RowSet
object's command and throws an
SQLException
object
 if all parameters have not been set.   Before the command is sent to the
 DBMS to be executed, these parameters will be substituted
 for placeholder parameters in the
PreparedStatement
object
 that is the command for a
RowSet
implementation extending
 the
BaseRowSet
class.
Each element in the array that is returned is an
Object
instance
 that contains the values of the parameters supplied to a setter method.
 The order of the elements is determined by the value supplied for
parameterIndex
.  If the setter method takes only the parameter index
 and the value to be set (possibly null), the array element will contain the value to be set
 (which will be expressed as an
Object
).  If there are additional
 parameters, the array element will itself be an array containing the value to be set
 plus any additional parameter values supplied to the setter method. If the method
 sets a stream, the array element includes the type of stream being supplied to the
 method. These additional parameters are for the use of the driver or the DBMS and may or
 may not be used.
NOTE: Stored parameter values of types

throws
SQLException
Sets the designated parameter to SQL

.
 This version of the method
setNull
should
 be used for user-defined types and REF type parameters.  Examples
 of user-defined types include: STRUCT, DISTINCT, JAVA_OBJECT, and
 named array types.
Note:
To be portable, applications must give the
 SQL type code and the fully-qualified SQL type name when specifying
 a NULL user-defined or REF parameter.  In the case of a user-defined type
 the name is the type name of the parameter itself.  For a REF
 parameter, the name is the type name of the referenced type.  If
 a JDBC driver does not need the type code or type name information,
 it may ignore it.

 Although it is intended for user-defined and Ref parameters,
 this method may be used to set a null parameter of any JDBC type.
 If the parameter does not have a user-defined or REF type, the given
 typeName is ignored.
Parameters:
parameterName
- the name of the parameter
sqlType
- a value from
java.sql.Types
typeName
- the fully-qualified name of an SQL user-defined type;
        ignored if the parameter is not a user-defined type or

SQLException
Sets the value of the designated parameter with the given object.
 The second parameter must be of type
Object
; therefore, the
java.lang
equivalent objects should be used for built-in types.
The JDBC specification specifies a standard mapping from
 Java
Object
types to SQL types.  The given argument
 will be converted to the corresponding SQL type before being
 sent to the database.
Note that this method may be used to pass database-
 specific abstract data types, by using a driver-specific Java
 type.

 If the object is of a class implementing the interface
SQLData
,
 the JDBC driver should call the method
SQLData.writeSQL
to write it to the SQL data stream.
 If, on the other hand, the object is of a class implementing

value when it sends it to the database.
Parameters:
parameterIndex
- of the first parameter is 1, the second is 2, ...
value
- the parameter value
Throws:
SQLException
- if the driver does not support national
         character sets;  if the driver can detect that a data conversion
  error could occur ; or if a database access error occurs
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
- if the JDBC driver does not
 support this method
Since:
1.6
setNClob
public
void
setNClob
(int parameterIndex,
Reader
reader)
throws
SQLException
Sets the designated parameter to a
Reader
object.
 This method differs from the
setCharacterStream (int, Reader)
method
 because it informs the driver that the parameter value should be sent to
 the server as a
NCLOB
.  When the
setCharacterStream
method is used, the
 driver may have to do extra work to determine whether the parameter
 data should be sent to the server as a
LONGNVARCHAR
or a
NCLOB
Note:
Consult your JDBC driver documentation to determine if
 it might be more efficient to use a version of
setNClob
which takes a length parameter.
Parameters:
parameterIndex
- index of the first parameter is 1, the second is 2, ...
reader
- An object that contains the data to set the parameter value to.
Throws:
SQLException
- if parameterIndex does not correspond to a parameter
 marker in the SQL statement;
 if the driver does not support national character sets;
 if the driver can detect that a data conversion
  error could occur;  if a database access error occurs or
 this method is called on a closed
PreparedStatement
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
- if the JDBC driver does not support this method
Since:
1.6
setURL
public
void
setURL
(int parameterIndex,
URL
x)
throws
SQLException
Sets the designated parameter to the given
java.net.URL
value.
 The driver converts this to an SQL
DATALINK
value
 when it sends it to the database.
Parameters:
parameterIndex
- the first parameter is 1, the second is 2, ...
x
- the
java.net.URL
object to be set
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs or
 this method is called on a closed
PreparedStatement
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
- if the JDBC driver does not support this method
