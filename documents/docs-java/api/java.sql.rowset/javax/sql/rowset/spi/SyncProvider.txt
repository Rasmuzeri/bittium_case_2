java.sql.rowset
Package
javax.sql.rowset.spi
Class SyncProvider
java.lang.Object
javax.sql.rowset.spi.SyncProvider
public abstract class
SyncProvider
extends
Object
The synchronization mechanism that provides reader/writer capabilities for
 disconnected
RowSet
objects.
 A
SyncProvider
implementation is a class that extends the
SyncProvider
abstract class.
A
SyncProvider
implementation is
 identified by a unique ID, which is its fully qualified class name.
 This name must be registered with the
SyncFactory
SPI, thus making the implementation available to
 all
RowSet
implementations.
 The factory mechanism in the reference implementation uses this name to instantiate
 the implementation, which can then provide a
RowSet
object with its
 reader (a
javax.sql.RowSetReader
object) and its writer (a
javax.sql.RowSetWriter
object).
The Jdbc
RowSet
Implementations specification provides two
 reference implementations of the
SyncProvider
abstract class:
RIOptimisticProvider
and
RIXMLProvider
.
 The
RIOptimisticProvider
can set any
RowSet
implementation with a
RowSetReader
object and a
RowSetWriter
object.  However, only the
RIXMLProvider
implementation can set an
XmlReader
object and an
XmlWriter
object. A
WebRowSet
object uses the
XmlReader
object to read data in XML format to populate itself with that
 data.  It uses the
XmlWriter
object to write itself to a stream or
java.io.Writer
object in XML format.
1.0 Naming Convention for Implementations
As a guide  to naming
SyncProvider
implementations, the following should be noted:
The name for a
SyncProvider
implementation
 is its fully qualified class name.
It is recommended that vendors supply a
SyncProvider
implementation in a package named
providers
.
For instance, if a vendor named Fred, Inc. offered a
SyncProvider
implementation, you could have the following:
Vendor name:  Fred, Inc.
     Domain name of vendor:  com.fred
     Package name:  com.fred.providers
     SyncProvider implementation class name:  HighAvailabilityProvider

     Fully qualified class name of SyncProvider implementation:
                        com.fred.providers.HighAvailabilityProvider
The following line of code uses the fully qualified name to register
 this implementation with the
SyncFactory
static instance.
SyncFactory.registerProvider(
                          "com.fred.providers.HighAvailabilityProvider");
The default
SyncProvider
object provided with the reference
 implementation uses the following name:
com.sun.rowset.providers.RIOptimisticProvider
Vendors should refer to the reference implementation synchronization
 providers for additional guidance on how to implement a new
SyncProvider
implementation.
2.0 How a
RowSet
Object Gets Its Provider
A disconnected
Rowset
object may get access to a
SyncProvider
object in one of the following two ways:
Using a constructor
CachedRowSet crs = new CachedRowSet(
                  "com.fred.providers.HighAvailabilitySyncProvider");
Using the
setSyncProvider
method
CachedRowSet crs = new CachedRowSet();
       crs.setSyncProvider("com.fred.providers.HighAvailabilitySyncProvider");
By default, the reference implementations of the
RowSet
synchronization
 providers are always available to the Java platform.
 If no other pluggable synchronization providers have been correctly
 registered, the
SyncFactory
will automatically generate
 an instance of the default
SyncProvider
reference implementation.
 Thus, in the preceding code fragment, if no implementation named
com.fred.providers.HighAvailabilitySyncProvider
has been
 registered with the
SyncFactory
instance,
crs
will be
 assigned the default provider in the reference implementation, which is
com.sun.rowset.providers.RIOptimisticProvider
.
3.0 Violations and Synchronization Issues
If an update between a disconnected
RowSet
object
 and a data source violates
 the original query or the underlying data source constraints, this will
 result in undefined behavior for all disconnected
RowSet
implementations
 and their designated
SyncProvider
implementations.
 Not defining the behavior when such violations occur offers greater flexibility
 for a
SyncProvider
implementation to determine its own best course of action.
A
SyncProvider
implementation
 may choose to implement a specific handler to
 handle a subset of query violations.
 However if an original query violation or a more general data source constraint
 violation is not handled by the
SyncProvider
implementation,
 all
SyncProvider
objects must throw a
SyncProviderException
.
4.0 Updatable SQL VIEWs
It is possible for any disconnected or connected
RowSet
object to be populated
 from an SQL query that is formulated originally from an SQL
VIEW
.
 While in many cases it is possible for an update to be performed to an
 underlying view, such an update requires additional metadata, which may vary.
 The
SyncProvider
class provides two constants to indicate whether
 an implementation supports updating an SQL
VIEW
.
NONUPDATABLE_VIEW_SYNC
- Indicates that a
SyncProvider
implementation does not support synchronization with an SQL
VIEW
as the
 underlying source of data for the
RowSet
object.
UPDATABLE_VIEW_SYNC
- Indicates that a
SyncProvider
implementation
 supports synchronization with an SQL
VIEW
as the underlying source
 of data.
The default is for a
RowSet
object not to be updatable if it was
 populated with data from an SQL
VIEW
.
5.0
SyncProvider
Constants
The
SyncProvider
class provides three sets of constants that
 are used as return values or parameters for
SyncProvider
methods.
SyncProvider
objects may be implemented to perform synchronization
 between a
RowSet
object and its underlying data source with varying
 degrees of care. The first group of constants indicate how synchronization
 is handled. For example,
GRADE_NONE
indicates that a
SyncProvider
object will not take any care to see what data is
 valid and will simply write the
RowSet
data to the data source.
GRADE_MODIFIED_AT_COMMIT
indicates that the provider will check
 only modified data for validity.  Other grades check all data for validity
 or set locks when data is modified or loaded.
Constants to indicate the synchronization grade of a
SyncProvider
object
SyncProvider.GRADE_NONE
SyncProvider.GRADE_MODIFIED_AT_COMMIT
SyncProvider.GRADE_CHECK_ALL_AT_COMMIT
SyncProvider.GRADE_LOCK_WHEN_MODIFIED
SyncProvider.GRADE_LOCK_WHEN_LOADED
Constants to indicate what locks are set on the data source
SyncProvider.DATASOURCE_NO_LOCK
SyncProvider.DATASOURCE_ROW_LOCK
SyncProvider.DATASOURCE_TABLE_LOCK
SyncProvider.DATASOURCE_DB_LOCK
Constants to indicate whether a
SyncProvider
object can
       perform updates to an SQL
VIEW
These constants are explained in the preceding section (4.0).
