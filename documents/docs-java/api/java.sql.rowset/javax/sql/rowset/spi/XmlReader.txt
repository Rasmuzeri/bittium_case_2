Interface XmlReader
All Superinterfaces:
RowSetReader
public interface
XmlReader
extends
RowSetReader
A specialized interface that facilitates an extension of the
SyncProvider
abstract class for XML orientated
 synchronization providers.
SyncProvider
implementations that supply XML data reader
 capabilities such as output XML stream capabilities can implement this
 interface to provide standard
XmlReader
objects to
WebRowSet
implementations.
An
XmlReader
object is registered as the
 XML reader for a
WebRowSet
by being assigned to the
 rowset's
xmlReader
field. When the
WebRowSet
object's
readXml
method is invoked, it in turn invokes
 its XML reader's
readXML
method.
Since:
1.5
