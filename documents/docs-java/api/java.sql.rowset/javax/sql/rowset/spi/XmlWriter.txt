Interface XmlWriter
All Superinterfaces:
RowSetWriter
public interface
XmlWriter
extends
RowSetWriter
A specialized interface that facilitates an extension of the
SyncProvider
abstract class for XML orientated
 synchronization providers.
SyncProvider
implementations that supply XML data writer
 capabilities such as output XML stream capabilities can implement this
 interface to provide standard
XmlWriter
objects to
WebRowSet
implementations.
Writing a
WebRowSet
object includes printing the
 rowset's data, metadata, and properties, all with the
 appropriate XML tags.
