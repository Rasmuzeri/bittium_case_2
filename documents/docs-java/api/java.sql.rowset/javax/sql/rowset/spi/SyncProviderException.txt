public class
SyncProviderException
extends
SQLException
Indicates an error with the
SyncProvider
mechanism. This exception
 is created by a
SyncProvider
abstract class extension if it
 encounters violations in reading from or writing to the originating data source.
If it is implemented to do so, the
SyncProvider
object may also create a
SyncResolver
object and either initialize the
SyncProviderException
object with it at construction time or set it with the
SyncProvider
object at
 a later time.
The method
acceptChanges
will throw this exception after the writer
 has finished checking for conflicts and has found one or more conflicts. An
 application may catch a
SyncProviderException
object and call its
getSyncResolver
method to get its
SyncResolver
object.
 See the code fragment in the interface comment for
SyncResolver
for an example.
 This
SyncResolver
object will mirror the
RowSet
object that generated the exception, except that it will contain only the values
 from the data source that are in conflict.  All other values in the
SyncResolver
object will be
null
.
The
SyncResolver
object may be used to examine and resolve
 each conflict in a row and then go to the next row with a conflict to
 repeat the procedure.
A
SyncProviderException
object may or may not contain a description of the
 condition causing the exception.  The inherited method
getMessage
may be
 called to retrieve the description if there is one.

syncResolver)
Constructs a
SyncProviderException
object with the specified
SyncResolver
instance.
Parameters:
syncResolver
- the
SyncResolver
instance used to
     to process the synchronization conflicts
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the
SyncResolver
object

.
Method Details
getSyncResolver
public
SyncResolver
getSyncResolver
()
Retrieves the
SyncResolver
object that has been set for
 this
SyncProviderException
object, or
 if none has been set, an instance of the default
SyncResolver
implementation included in the reference implementation.
If a
SyncProviderException
object is thrown, an application
 may use this method to generate a
SyncResolver
object
 with which to resolve the conflict or conflicts that caused the
 exception to be thrown.
Returns:
the
SyncResolver
object set for this
SyncProviderException
object or, if none has
     been set, an instance of the default
SyncResolver
implementation. In addition, the default
SyncResolver
implementation is also returned if the
SyncResolver()
or
SyncResolver(String)
constructors are used to instantiate
     the
SyncResolver
instance.
setSyncResolver
public
void
setSyncResolver
(
SyncResolver
syncResolver)
Sets the
SyncResolver
object for this
SyncProviderException
object to the one supplied.
 If the argument supplied is
null
, a call to the method
getSyncResolver
will return the default reference
 implementation of the
SyncResolver
interface.
Parameters:
syncResolver
- the
SyncResolver
object to be set;
     cannot be
null
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the
SyncResolver
object
     is
null
.
