Method Details
createSubject
public static
Subject
createSubject
(
GSSName
principals,
GSSCredential
credentials)
Use this method to convert a GSSName and GSSCredential into a
 Subject. Typically this would be done by a server that wants to
 impersonate a client thread at the Java level by setting a client
 Subject in the current access control context. If the server is merely
 interested in using a principal based policy in its local JVM, then
 it only needs to provide the GSSName of the client.

 The elements from the GSSName are placed in the principals set of this
 Subject and those from the GSSCredential are placed in the private
 credentials set of the Subject. Any Kerberos specific elements that
 are added to the subject will be instances of the standard Kerberos
 implementation classes defined in javax.security.auth.kerberos.
Parameters:
principals
- a GSSName containing one or more mechanism specific
 representations of the same entity. These mechanism specific
 representations will be populated in the returned Subject's principal
 set.
credentials
- a GSSCredential containing one or more mechanism
 specific credentials for the same entity. These mechanism specific
 credentials will be populated in the returned Subject's private
 credential set. Passing in a value of null will imply that the private
 credential set should be left empty.
Returns:
a Subject with the entries that contain elements from the
 given GSSName and GSSCredential.
