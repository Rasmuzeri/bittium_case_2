public interface
XMLReader
Interface for reading an XML document using callbacks.
XMLReader is the interface that an XML parser's SAX2 driver must
 implement.  This interface allows an application to set and
 query features and properties in the parser, to register
 event handlers for document processing, and to initiate
 a document parse.
All SAX interfaces are assumed to be synchronous: the
parse
methods must not return until parsing
 is complete, and readers must wait for an event-handler callback
 to return before reporting the next event.
This interface replaces the (now deprecated) SAX 1.0
Parser
interface.  The XMLReader interface
 contains two important enhancements over the old Parser
 interface (as well as some minor ones):
it adds a standard way to query and set features and
  properties; and
it adds Namespace support, which is required for many
  higher-level XML standards.
There are adapters available to convert a SAX1 Parser to
 a SAX2 XMLReader and vice-versa.
API Note:
Despite its name, this interface does
not
extend the standard Java
Reader
interface, because reading XML is a fundamentally different activity
 than reading character data.

1.4, SAX 2.0

Look up the value of a feature flag.
The feature name is any fully-qualified URI.  It is
 possible for an XMLReader to recognize a feature name but
 temporarily be unable to return its value.
 Some feature values may be available only in specific
 contexts, such as before, during, or after a parse.
 Also, some feature values may not be programmatically accessible.
 (In the case of an adapter for SAX1
Parser
, there is no
 implementation-independent way to expose whether the underlying
 parser is performing validation, expanding external entities,
 and so forth.)
All XMLReaders are required to recognize the
 http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces and the
 http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes feature names.
Typical usage is something like this:
XMLReader r = new MySAXDriver();

                         // try to activate validation
 try {
   r.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/validation", true);
 } catch (SAXException e) {
   System.err.println("Cannot activate validation.");
 }

                         // register event handlers
 r.setContentHandler(new MyContentHandler());
 r.setErrorHandler(new MyErrorHandler());

                         // parse the first document
 try {
   r.parse("http://www.foo.com/mydoc.xml");
 } catch (IOException e) {
   System.err.println("I/O exception reading XML document");
 } catch (SAXException e) {
   System.err.println("XML exception reading document.");
 }
Implementors are free (and encouraged) to invent their own features,
 using names built on their own URIs.
Parameters:
name
- The feature name, which is a fully-qualified URI.
Returns:
The current value of the feature (true or false).
Throws:
SAXNotRecognizedException
- If the feature
            value can't be assigned or retrieved.
SAXNotSupportedException
- When the
            XMLReader recognizes the feature name but
            cannot determine its value at this time.

SAXNotSupportedException
Set the value of a feature flag.
The feature name is any fully-qualified URI.  It is
 possible for an XMLReader to expose a feature value but
 to be unable to change the current value.
 Some feature values may be immutable or mutable only
 in specific contexts, such as before, during, or after
 a parse.
All XMLReaders are required to support setting
 http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces to true and
 http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes to false.
Parameters:
name
- The feature name, which is a fully-qualified URI.
value
- The requested value of the feature (true or false).
Throws:
SAXNotRecognizedException
- If the feature
            value can't be assigned or retrieved.
SAXNotSupportedException
- When the
            XMLReader recognizes the feature name but
            cannot set the requested value.

Look up the value of a property.
The property name is any fully-qualified URI.  It is
 possible for an XMLReader to recognize a property name but
 temporarily be unable to return its value.
 Some property values may be available only in specific
 contexts, such as before, during, or after a parse.
XMLReaders are not required to recognize any specific
 property names, though an initial core set is documented for
 SAX2.
Implementors are free (and encouraged) to invent their own properties,
 using names built on their own URIs.
Parameters:
name
- The property name, which is a fully-qualified URI.
Returns:
The current value of the property.
Throws:
SAXNotRecognizedException
- If the property
            value can't be assigned or retrieved.
SAXNotSupportedException
- When the
            XMLReader recognizes the property name but
            cannot determine its value at this time.

Set the value of a property.
The property name is any fully-qualified URI.  It is
 possible for an XMLReader to recognize a property name but
 to be unable to change the current value.
 Some property values may be immutable or mutable only
 in specific contexts, such as before, during, or after
 a parse.
XMLReaders are not required to recognize setting
 any specific property names, though a core set is defined by
 SAX2.
This method is also the standard mechanism for setting
 extended handlers.
Parameters:
name
- The property name, which is a fully-qualified URI.
value
- The requested value for the property.
Throws:
SAXNotRecognizedException
- If the property
            value can't be assigned or retrieved.
SAXNotSupportedException
- When the
            XMLReader recognizes the property name but
            cannot set the requested value.
setEntityResolver
void
setEntityResolver
(
EntityResolver
resolver)
Allow an application to register an entity resolver.
If the application does not register an entity resolver,
 the XMLReader will perform its own default resolution.
Applications may register a new or different resolver in the
 middle of a parse, and the SAX parser must begin using the new
 resolver immediately.
Parameters:
resolver
- The entity resolver.
See Also:
getEntityResolver()
getEntityResolver
EntityResolver
getEntityResolver
()
Return the current entity resolver.
Returns:
The current entity resolver, or null if none
         has been registered.
See Also:
setEntityResolver(org.xml.sax.EntityResolver)
setDTDHandler
void
setDTDHandler
(
DTDHandler
handler)
Allow an application to register a DTD event handler.
If the application does not register a DTD handler, all DTD
 events reported by the SAX parser will be silently ignored.
Applications may register a new or different handler in the
 middle of a parse, and the SAX parser must begin using the new
 handler immediately.
Parameters:
handler
- The DTD handler.
See Also:
getDTDHandler()
getDTDHandler
DTDHandler
getDTDHandler
()
Return the current DTD handler.
Returns:
The current DTD handler, or null if none
         has been registered.
See Also:
setDTDHandler(org.xml.sax.DTDHandler)
setContentHandler
void
setContentHandler
(
ContentHandler
handler)
Allow an application to register a content event handler.
If the application does not register a content handler, all
 content events reported by the SAX parser will be silently
 ignored.
Applications may register a new or different handler in the
 middle of a parse, and the SAX parser must begin using the new
 handler immediately.
Parameters:
handler
- The content handler.
See Also:
getContentHandler()

ContentHandler
getContentHandler
()
Return the current content handler.
Returns:
The current content handler, or null if none
         has been registered.
See Also:
setContentHandler(org.xml.sax.ContentHandler)
setErrorHandler
void
setErrorHandler
(
ErrorHandler
handler)
Allow an application to register an error event handler.
If the application does not register an error handler, all
 error events reported by the SAX parser will be silently
 ignored; however, normal processing may not continue.  It is
 highly recommended that all SAX applications implement an
 error handler to avoid unexpected bugs.
Applications may register a new or different handler in the
 middle of a parse, and the SAX parser must begin using the new
 handler immediately.
Parameters:
handler
- The error handler.

parse
void
parse
(
InputSource
input)
throws
IOException
,
SAXException
Parse an XML document.
The application can use this method to instruct the XML
 reader to begin parsing an XML document from any valid input
 source (a character stream, a byte stream, or a URI).
Applications may not invoke this method while a parse is in
 progress (they should create a new XMLReader instead for each
 nested XML document).  Once a parse is complete, an
 application may reuse the same XMLReader object, possibly with a
 different input source.
 Configuration of the XMLReader object (such as handler bindings and
 values established for feature flags and properties) is unchanged
 by completion of a parse, unless the definition of that aspect of
 the configuration explicitly specifies other behavior.
 (For example, feature flags or properties exposing
 characteristics of the document being parsed.)
During the parse, the XMLReader will provide information
 about the XML document through the registered event
 handlers.
This method is synchronous: it will not return until parsing
 has ended.  If a client application wants to terminate
 parsing early, it should throw an exception.
Parameters:
input
- The input source for the top-level of the
        XML document.
Throws:
SAXException
- Any SAX exception, possibly
            wrapping another exception.
IOException
- An IO exception from the parser,
            possibly from a byte stream or character stream
            supplied by the application.

parse
void
parse
(
String
systemId)
throws
IOException
,
SAXException
Parse an XML document from a system identifier (URI).
This method is a shortcut for the common case of reading a
 document from a system identifier.  It is the exact
 equivalent of the following:
parse(new InputSource(systemId));
If the system identifier is a URL, it must be fully resolved
 by the application before it is passed to the parser.
Parameters:
systemId
- The system identifier (URI).
Throws:
SAXException
- Any SAX exception, possibly
            wrapping another exception.
IOException
- An IO exception from the parser,
            possibly from a byte stream or character stream
            supplied by the application.
