public interface
DTDHandler
Receive notification of basic DTD-related events.
If a SAX application needs information about notations and
 unparsed entities, then the application implements this
 interface and registers an instance with the SAX parser using
 the parser's setDTDHandler method.  The parser uses the
 instance to report notation and unparsed entity declarations to
 the application.
Note that this interface includes only those DTD events that
 the XML recommendation
requires
processors to report:
 notation and unparsed entity declarations.
The SAX parser may report these events in any order, regardless
 of the order in which the notations and unparsed entities were
 declared; however, all DTD events must be reported after the
 document handler's startDocument event, and before the first
 startElement event.
 (If the
LexicalHandler
is
 used, these events must also be reported before the endDTD event.)
It is up to the application to store the information for
 future use (perhaps in a hash table or object tree).
 If the application encounters attributes of type "NOTATION",
 "ENTITY", or "ENTITIES", it can use the information that it
 obtained through this interface to find the entity and/or
 notation corresponding with the attribute value.

1.4, SAX 1.0

throws
SAXException
Receive notification of a notation declaration event.
It is up to the application to record the notation for later
 reference, if necessary;
 notations may appear as attribute values and in unparsed entity
 declarations, and are sometime used with processing instruction
 target names.
At least one of publicId and systemId must be non-null.
 If a system identifier is present, and it is a URL, the SAX
 parser must resolve it fully before passing it to the
 application through this event.
There is no guarantee that the notation declaration will be
 reported before any unparsed entities that use it.
Parameters:
name
- The notation name.
publicId
- The notation's public identifier, or null if
        none was given.
systemId
- The notation's system identifier, or null if
        none was given.
Throws:
SAXException
- Any SAX exception, possibly
            wrapping another exception.

notationName)
throws
SAXException
Receive notification of an unparsed entity declaration event.
Note that the notation name corresponds to a notation
 reported by the
notationDecl
event.
 It is up to the application to record the entity for later
 reference, if necessary;
 unparsed entities may appear as attribute values.
If the system identifier is a URL, the parser must resolve it
 fully before passing it to the application.
Parameters:
name
- The unparsed entity's name.
publicId
- The entity's public identifier, or null if none
        was given.
systemId
- The entity's system identifier.
notationName
- The name of the associated notation.
Throws:
SAXException
- Any SAX exception, possibly
            wrapping another exception.
