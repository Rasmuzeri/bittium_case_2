Interface EntityResolver2
All Superinterfaces:
EntityResolver
All Known Implementing Classes:
DefaultHandler2
public interface
EntityResolver2
extends
EntityResolver
Extended interface for mapping external entity references to input
 sources, or providing a missing external subset.  The
XMLReader.setEntityResolver()
method
 is used to provide implementations of this interface to parsers.
 When a parser uses the methods in this interface, the
EntityResolver2.resolveEntity()
method (in this interface) is used
instead of
the older (SAX 1.0)
EntityResolver.resolveEntity()
method.
If a SAX application requires the customized handling which this
 interface defines for external entities, it must ensure that it uses
 an XMLReader with the
http://xml.org/sax/features/use-entity-resolver2
feature flag
 set to
true
(which is its default value when the feature is
 recognized).  If that flag is unrecognized, or its value is false,
 or the resolver does not implement this interface, then only the
EntityResolver
method will be used.
That supports three categories of application that modify entity
 resolution.
Old Style
applications won't know about this interface;
 they will provide an EntityResolver.
Transitional Mode
provide an EntityResolver2 and automatically
 get the benefit of its methods in any systems (parsers or other tools)
 supporting it, due to polymorphism.
 Both
Old Style
and
Transitional Mode
applications will
 work with any SAX2 parser.
New style
applications will fail to run except on SAX2 parsers
 that support this particular feature.
 They will insist that feature flag have a value of "true", and the
 EntityResolver2 implementation they provide  might throw an exception
 if the original SAX 1.0 style entity resolution method is invoked.
Since:
1.5, SAX 2.0 (extensions 1.1 alpha)

Method Details
getExternalSubset
InputSource
getExternalSubset
(
String
name,
String
baseURI)
throws
SAXException
,
IOException
Allows applications to provide an external subset for documents
 that don't explicitly define one.  Documents with DOCTYPE declarations
 that omit an external subset can thus augment the declarations
 available for validation, entity processing, and attribute processing
 (normalization, defaulting, and reporting types including ID).
 This augmentation is reported
 through the
startDTD()
method as if
 the document text had originally included the external subset;
 this callback is made before any internal subset data or errors
 are reported.
This method can also be used with documents that have no DOCTYPE
 declaration.  When the root element is encountered,
 but no DOCTYPE declaration has been seen, this method is
 invoked.  If it returns a value for the external subset, that root
 element is declared to be the root element, giving the effect of
 splicing a DOCTYPE declaration at the end the prolog of a document
 that could not otherwise be valid.  The sequence of parser callbacks
 in that case logically resembles this:
... comments and PIs from the prolog (as usual)
 startDTD ("rootName", source.getPublicId (), source.getSystemId ());
 startEntity ("[dtd]");
 ... declarations, comments, and PIs from the external subset
 endEntity ("[dtd]");
 endDTD ();
 ... then the rest of the document (as usual)
 startElement (..., "rootName", ...);
Note that the InputSource gets no further resolution.
 Implementations of this method may wish to invoke
resolveEntity()
to gain benefits such as use
 of local caches of DTD entities.  Also, this method will never be
 used by a (non-validating) processor that is not including external
 parameter entities.
Uses for this method include facilitating data validation when
 interoperating with XML processors that would always require
 undesirable network accesses for external entities, or which for
 other reasons adopt a "no DTDs" policy.
 Non-validation motives include forcing documents to include DTDs so
 that attributes are handled consistently.
 For example, an XPath processor needs to know which attributes have
 type "ID" before it can process a widely used type of reference.
Warning:
Returning an external subset modifies
 the input document.  By providing definitions for general entities,
 it can make a malformed document appear to be well formed.
Parameters:
name
- Identifies the document root element.  This name comes
  from a DOCTYPE declaration (where available) or from the actual
  root element.
baseURI
- The document's base URI, serving as an additional
  hint for selecting the external subset.  This is always an absolute
  URI, unless it is null because the XMLReader was given an InputSource
  without one.
Returns:
An InputSource object describing the new external subset
  to be used by the parser, or null to indicate that no external
  subset is provided.
Throws:
SAXException
- Any SAX exception, possibly wrapping
  another exception.
IOException
- Probably indicating a failure to create
  a new InputStream or Reader, or an illegal URL.

name,

publicId,
String
baseURI,
String
systemId)
throws
SAXException
,
IOException
Allows applications to map references to external entities into input
 sources, or tell the parser it should use conventional URI resolution.
 This method is only called for external entities which have been
 properly declared.
 This method provides more flexibility than the
EntityResolver
interface, supporting implementations of more complex catalogue
 schemes such as the one defined by the
OASIS XML Catalogs
specification.
Parsers configured to use this resolver method will call it
 to determine the input source to use for any external entity
 being included because of a reference in the XML text.
 That excludes the document entity, and any external entity returned
 by
getExternalSubset()
.
 When a (non-validating) processor is configured not to include
 a class of entities (parameter or general) through use of feature
 flags, this method is not invoked for such entities.
Note that the entity naming scheme used here is the same one
 used in the
LexicalHandler
, or in the
ContentHandler.skippedEntity()
method.
Parameters:
name
- Identifies the external entity being resolved.
  Either "[dtd]" for the external subset, or a name starting
  with "%" to indicate a parameter entity, or else the name of
  a general entity.  This is never null when invoked by a SAX2
  parser.
publicId
- The public identifier of the external entity being
  referenced (normalized as required by the XML specification), or
  null if none was supplied.
baseURI
- The URI with respect to which relative systemIDs
  are interpreted.  This is always an absolute URI, unless it is
  null (likely because the XMLReader was given an InputSource without
  one).  This URI is defined by the XML specification to be the one
  associated with the "<" starting the relevant declaration.
systemId
- The system identifier of the external entity
  being referenced; either a relative or absolute URI.
  This is never null when invoked by a SAX2 parser; only declared
  entities, and any external subset, are resolved by such parsers.
Returns:
An InputSource object describing the new input source to
  be used by the parser.  Returning null directs the parser to
  resolve the system ID against the base URI and open a connection
  to resulting URI.
Throws:
SAXException
- Any SAX exception, possibly wrapping
  another exception.
IOException
- Probably indicating a failure to create
  a new InputStream or Reader, or an illegal URL.
