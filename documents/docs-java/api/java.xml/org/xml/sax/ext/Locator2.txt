Interface Locator2
All Superinterfaces:
Locator
All Known Implementing Classes:
Locator2Impl
public interface
Locator2
extends
Locator
SAX2 extension to augment the entity information provided
 through a
Locator
.
 If an implementation supports this extension, the Locator
 provided in
ContentHandler.setDocumentLocator()
will implement this
 interface, and the
http://xml.org/sax/features/use-locator2
feature
 flag will have the value
true
.
XMLReader implementations are not required to support this
 information, and it is not part of core-only SAX2 distributions.
Since:
1.5, SAX 2.0 (extensions 1.1 alpha)

Method Details
getXMLVersion
String
getXMLVersion
()
Returns the version of XML used for the entity.  This will
 normally be the identifier from the current entity's
<?xml version='...' ...?>
declaration,
 or be defaulted by the parser.
Returns:
Identifier for the XML version being used to interpret
 the entity's text, or null if that information is not yet
 available in the current parsing state.
getEncoding
String
getEncoding
()
Returns the name of the character encoding for the entity.
 If the encoding was declared externally (for example, in a MIME
 Content-Type header), that will be the name returned.  Else if there
 was an
<?xml ...encoding='...'?>
declaration at
 the start of the document, that encoding name will be returned.
 Otherwise the encoding will been inferred (normally to be UTF-8, or
 some UTF-16 variant), and that inferred name will be returned.
When an
InputSource
is used
 to provide an entity's character stream, this method returns the
 encoding provided in that input stream.
Note that some recent W3C specifications require that text
 in some encodings be normalized, using Unicode Normalization
 Form C, before processing.  Such normalization must be performed
 by applications, and would normally be triggered based on the
 value returned by this method.
Encoding names may be those used by the underlying JVM,
 and comparisons should be case-insensitive.
Returns:
Name of the character encoding being used to interpret
 * the entity's text, or null if this was not provided for a *
 character stream passed through an InputSource or is otherwise
 not yet available in the current parsing state.
