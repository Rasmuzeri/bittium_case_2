public interface
Locator
Interface for associating a SAX event with a document location.
If a SAX parser provides location information to the SAX
 application, it does so by implementing this interface and then
 passing an instance to the application using the content
 handler's
setDocumentLocator
method.  The application can use the
 object to obtain the location of any other SAX event
 in the XML source document.
Note that the results returned by the object will be valid only
 during the scope of each callback method: the application
 will receive unpredictable results if it attempts to use the
 locator at any other time, or after parsing completes.
SAX parsers are not required to supply a locator, but they are
 very strongly encouraged to do so.  If the parser supplies a
 locator, it must do so before reporting any other document events.
 If no locator has been set by the time the application receives
 the
startDocument
event, the application should assume that a locator is not
 available.
Since:
1.4, SAX 1.0

Abstract Methods
Modifier and Type
Method
Description
int
getColumnNumber
()
Return the column number where the current document event ends.
int
getLineNumber
()
Return the line number where the current document event ends.
String
getPublicId
()
Return the public identifier for the current document event.
String
getSystemId
()
Return the system identifier for the current document event.
Method Details
getPublicId
String
getPublicId
()
Return the public identifier for the current document event.
The return value is the public identifier of the document
 entity or of the external parsed entity in which the markup
 triggering the event appears.
Returns:
A string containing the public identifier, or
         null if none is available.
See Also:
getSystemId()
getSystemId
String
getSystemId
()
Return the system identifier for the current document event.
The return value is the system identifier of the document
 entity or of the external parsed entity in which the markup
 triggering the event appears.
If the system identifier is a URL, the parser must resolve it
 fully before passing it to the application.  For example, a file
 name must always be provided as a
file:...
URL, and other
 kinds of relative URI are also resolved against their bases.
Returns:
A string containing the system identifier, or null
         if none is available.

getPublicId()
getLineNumber
int
getLineNumber
()
Return the line number where the current document event ends.
 Lines are delimited by line ends, which are defined in
 the XML specification.
Warning:
The return value from the method
 is intended only as an approximation for the sake of diagnostics;
 it is not intended to provide sufficient information
 to edit the character content of the original XML document.
 In some cases, these "line" numbers match what would be displayed
 as columns, and in others they may not match the source text
 due to internal entity expansion.
The return value is an approximation of the line number
 in the document entity or external parsed entity where the
 markup triggering the event appears.
If possible, the SAX driver should provide the line position
 of the first character after the text associated with the document
 event.  The first line is line 1.
Returns:
The line number, or -1 if none is available.
See Also:
getColumnNumber()
getColumnNumber
int
getColumnNumber
()
Return the column number where the current document event ends.
 This is one-based number of Java
char
values since
 the last line end.
Warning:
The return value from the method
 is intended only as an approximation for the sake of diagnostics;
 it is not intended to provide sufficient information
 to edit the character content of the original XML document.
 For example, when lines contain combining character sequences, wide
 characters, surrogate pairs, or bi-directional text, the value may
 not correspond to the column in a text editor's display.
The return value is an approximation of the column number
 in the document entity or external parsed entity where the
 markup triggering the event appears.
If possible, the SAX driver should provide the line position
 of the first character after the text associated with the document
 event.  The first column in each line is column 1.
Returns:
The column number, or -1 if none is available.

getLineNumber()
