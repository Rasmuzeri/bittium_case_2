Interface XMLFilter
All Superinterfaces:
XMLReader
All Known Implementing Classes:
XMLFilterImpl
public interface
XMLFilter
extends
XMLReader
Interface for an XML filter.
An XML filter is like an XML reader, except that it obtains its
 events from another XML reader rather than a primary source like
 an XML document or database.  Filters can modify a stream of
 events as they pass on to the final application.
The XMLFilterImpl helper class provides a convenient base
 for creating SAX2 filters, by passing on all
EntityResolver
,
DTDHandler
,
ContentHandler
and
ErrorHandler
events automatically.
Since:
1.4, SAX 2.0

Method Details
setParent
void
setParent
(
XMLReader
parent)
Set the parent reader.
This method allows the application to link the filter to
 a parent reader (which may be another filter).  The argument
 may not be null.
Parameters:
parent
- The parent reader.
getParent
XMLReader
getParent
()
Get the parent reader.
This method allows the application to query the parent
 reader (which may be another filter).  It is generally a
 bad idea to perform any operations on the parent reader
 directly: they should all pass through this filter.
Returns:
The parent filter, or null if none has been set.
