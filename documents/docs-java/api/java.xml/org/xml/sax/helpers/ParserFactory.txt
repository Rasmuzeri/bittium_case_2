@Deprecated

since
="1.5")
public class
ParserFactory
extends
Object
Deprecated.
This class works with the deprecated
Parser
interface.
Java-specific class for dynamically loading SAX parsers.
Note:
This class is designed to work with the now-deprecated
 SAX1
Parser
class.  SAX2 applications should use
XMLReaderFactory
instead.
ParserFactory is not part of the platform-independent definition
 of SAX; it is an additional convenience class designed
 specifically for Java XML application writers.  SAX applications
 can use the static methods in this class to allocate a SAX parser
 dynamically at run-time based either on the value of the
 `org.xml.sax.parser' system property or on a string containing the class
 name.
Note that the application still requires an XML parser that
 implements SAX1.
Since:
1.4, SAX 1.0

Deprecated.
Create a new SAX parser using the `org.xml.sax.parser' system property.
The named class must exist and must implement the
Parser
interface.
Returns:
a new SAX parser
Throws:
NullPointerException
- There is no value
            for the `org.xml.sax.parser' system property.
ClassNotFoundException
- The SAX parser
            class was not found (check your CLASSPATH).
IllegalAccessException
- The SAX parser class was
            found, but you do not have permission to load
            it.
InstantiationException
- The SAX parser class was
            found but could not be instantiated.
ClassCastException
- The SAX parser class
            was found and instantiated, but does not implement
            org.xml.sax.Parser.
