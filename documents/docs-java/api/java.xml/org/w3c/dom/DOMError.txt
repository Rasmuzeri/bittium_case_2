SEVERITY_ERROR
The severity of the error described by the

SEVERITY_ERROR
may not cause the processing to
 stop if the error can be recovered, unless
DOMErrorHandler.handleError()
returns
false
.

static final
short
SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR
The severity of the error described by the
DOMError
is
 fatal error. A

will cause the
 normal processing to stop. The return value of

Method Details
getSeverity
short
getSeverity
()
The severity of the error, either
SEVERITY_WARNING
,
SEVERITY_ERROR
, or
SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR
.
getMessage
String
getMessage
()
An implementation specific string describing the error that occurred.
getType
String
getType
()
A
DOMString
indicating which related data is expected in
relatedData
. Users should refer to the specification of
 the error in order to find its
DOMString
type and
relatedData
definitions if any.
Note:
As an example,
Document.normalizeDocument()
does generate warnings when
 the "split-cdata-sections" parameter is in use. Therefore, the method
 generates a
SEVERITY_WARNING
with
type
"cdata-sections-splitted"
and the first
CDATASection
node in document order resulting from the
 split is returned by the
relatedData
attribute.
getRelatedException
Object
getRelatedException
()
The related platform dependent exception if any.
getRelatedData
Object
getRelatedData
()
The related
DOMError.type
dependent data if any.
getLocation
DOMLocator
getLocation
()
The location of the error.
