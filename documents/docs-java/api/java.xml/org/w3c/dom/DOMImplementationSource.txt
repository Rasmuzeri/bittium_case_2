Interface DOMImplementationSource
public interface
DOMImplementationSource
This interface permits a DOM implementer to supply one or more
 implementations, based upon requested features and versions, as specified
 in
DOM
 Features
. Each implemented
DOMImplementationSource
object is
 listed in the binding-specific list of available sources so that its
DOMImplementation
objects are made available.

Method Details
getDOMImplementation
DOMImplementation
getDOMImplementation
(
String
features)
A method to request the first DOM implementation that supports the
 specified features.
Parameters:
features
- A string that specifies which features and versions
   are required. This is a space separated list in which each feature
   is specified by its name optionally followed by a space and a
   version number.  This method returns the first item of the list
   returned by
getDOMImplementationList
.  As an example,
   the string
"XML 3.0 Traversal +Events 2.0"
will
   request a DOM implementation that supports the module "XML" for its
   3.0 version, a module that support of the "Traversal" module for
   any version, and the module "Events" for its 2.0 version. The
   module "Events" must be accessible using the method
Node.getFeature()
and
DOMImplementation.getFeature()
.
Returns:
The first DOM implementation that support the desired
   features, or
null
if this source has none.

A method to request a list of DOM implementations that support the
 specified features and versions, as specified in .
Parameters:
features
- A string that specifies which features and versions
   are required. This is a space separated list in which each feature
   is specified by its name optionally followed by a space and a
