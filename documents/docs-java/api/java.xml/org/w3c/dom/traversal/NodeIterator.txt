Interface NodeIterator
public interface
NodeIterator
NodeIterators
are used to step through a set of nodes, e.g.
 the set of nodes in a
NodeList
, the document subtree
 governed by a particular
Node
, the results of a query, or
 any other set of nodes. The set of nodes to be iterated is determined by
 the implementation of the
NodeIterator
. DOM Level 2
 specifies a single
NodeIterator
implementation for
 document-order traversal of a document subtree. Instances of these
NodeIterators
are created by calling
DocumentTraversal
.createNodeIterator()
.
See also the
Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Traversal and Range Specification
.
Since:
9, DOM Level 2
Method Summary
All Methods
Instance Methods
Abstract Methods
Modifier and Type
Method
Description
void
detach
()
Detaches the
NodeIterator
from the set which it iterated
 over, releasing any computational resources and placing the
NodeIterator
in the INVALID state.
boolean
getExpandEntityReferences
()
The value of this flag determines whether the children of entity
 reference nodes are visible to the
NodeIterator
.
NodeFilter
getFilter
()
The
NodeFilter
used to screen nodes.
Node
getRoot
()
The root node of the
NodeIterator
, as specified when it
 was created.
int
getWhatToShow
()
This attribute determines which node types are presented via the
NodeIterator
.
Node
nextNode
()
Returns the next node in the set and advances the position of the
NodeIterator
in the set.
Node
previousNode
()
Returns the previous node in the set and moves the position of the
NodeIterator
backwards in the set.
Method Details
getRoot
Node
getRoot
()
The root node of the
NodeIterator
, as specified when it
 was created.
getWhatToShow
int
getWhatToShow
()
This attribute determines which node types are presented via the
NodeIterator
. The available set of constants is defined
 in the
NodeFilter
interface.  Nodes not accepted by
whatToShow
will be skipped, but their children may still
 be considered. Note that this skip takes precedence over the filter,
 if any.
getFilter
NodeFilter
getFilter
()
The
NodeFilter
used to screen nodes.
getExpandEntityReferences
boolean
getExpandEntityReferences
()
The value of this flag determines whether the children of entity
 reference nodes are visible to the
NodeIterator
. If
 false, these children  and their descendants will be rejected. Note
 that this rejection takes precedence over
whatToShow
and
 the filter. Also note that this is currently the only situation where
NodeIterators
may reject a complete subtree rather than
 skipping individual nodes.
To produce a view of the document that has entity references
 expanded and does not expose the entity reference node itself, use
 the
whatToShow
flags to hide the entity reference node
 and set
expandEntityReferences
to true when creating the
NodeIterator
. To produce a view of the document that has
 entity reference nodes but no entity expansion, use the
whatToShow
flags to show the entity reference node and
 set
expandEntityReferences
to false.
nextNode
Node
nextNode
()
       throws
DOMException
Returns the next node in the set and advances the position of the
NodeIterator
in the set. After a
NodeIterator
is created, the first call to
nextNode()
returns the first node in the set.
Returns:
The next
Node
in the set being iterated over, or
null
if there are no more members in that set.
Throws:
DOMException
- INVALID_STATE_ERR: Raised if this method is called after the
detach
method was invoked.
previousNode
Node
previousNode
()
           throws
DOMException
Returns the previous node in the set and moves the position of the
NodeIterator
backwards in the set.
Returns:
The previous
Node
in the set being iterated over,
   or
null
if there are no more members in that set.
Throws:
DOMException
- INVALID_STATE_ERR: Raised if this method is called after the
detach
method was invoked.
detach
void
detach
()
Detaches the
NodeIterator
from the set which it iterated
 over, releasing any computational resources and placing the
NodeIterator
in the INVALID state. After
detach
has been invoked, calls to
nextNode
or
previousNode
will raise the exception
 INVALID_STATE_ERR.
