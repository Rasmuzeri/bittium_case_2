DocumentTraversal
DocumentTraversal
contains methods that create
NodeIterators
and
TreeWalkers
to traverse a
 node and its children in document order (depth first, pre-order
 traversal, which is equivalent to the order in which the start tags occur
 in the text representation of the document).
NodeFilter
Filters are objects that know how to "filter out" nodes.
NodeIterator
NodeIterators
are used to step through a set of nodes, e.g.
TreeWalker
TreeWalker
objects are used to navigate a document tree or
 subtree using the view of the document defined by their
whatToShow
flags and filter (if any).
