Interface UserDataHandler
public interface
UserDataHandler
When associating an object to a key on a node using
Node.setUserData()
the application can provide a handler
 that gets called when the node the object is associated to is being
 cloned, imported, or renamed. This can be used by the application to
 implement various behaviors regarding the data it associates to the DOM
 nodes. This interface defines that handler.

void

(short operation,

data,
Node
src,
Node
dst)
This method is called whenever the node for which this handler is
 registered is imported or cloned.
DOM applications must not raise exceptions in a
UserDataHandler
. The effect of throwing exceptions from
 the handler is DOM implementation dependent.
Parameters:
operation
- Specifies the type of operation that is being
   performed on the node.
key
- Specifies the key for which this handler is being called.
data
- Specifies the data for which this handler is being called.
src
- Specifies the node being cloned, adopted, imported, or
   renamed. This is
null
when the node is being deleted.
dst
- Specifies the node newly created if any, or
null
