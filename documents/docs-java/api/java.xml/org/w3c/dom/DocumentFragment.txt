Interface DocumentFragment
All Superinterfaces:
Node
public interface
DocumentFragment
extends
Node
DocumentFragment
is a "lightweight" or "minimal"
Document
object. It is very common to want to be able to
 extract a portion of a document's tree or to create a new fragment of a
 document. Imagine implementing a user command like cut or rearranging a
 document by moving fragments around. It is desirable to have an object
 which can hold such fragments and it is quite natural to use a Node for
 this purpose. While it is true that a
Document
object could
 fulfill this role, a
Document
object can potentially be a
 heavyweight object, depending on the underlying implementation. What is
 really needed for this is a very lightweight object.
DocumentFragment
is such an object.
Furthermore, various operations -- such as inserting nodes as children
 of another
Node
-- may take
DocumentFragment
objects as arguments; this results in all the child nodes of the
DocumentFragment
being moved to the child list of this node.
The children of a
DocumentFragment
node are zero or more
 nodes representing the tops of any sub-trees defining the structure of
 the document.
DocumentFragment
nodes do not need to be
 well-formed XML documents (although they do need to follow the rules
 imposed upon well-formed XML parsed entities, which can have multiple top
 nodes). For example, a
DocumentFragment
might have only one
 child and that child node could be a
Text
node. Such a
 structure model represents neither an HTML document nor a well-formed XML
 document.
When a
DocumentFragment
is inserted into a
Document
(or indeed any other
Node
that may
 take children) the children of the
DocumentFragment
and not
 the
DocumentFragment
itself are inserted into the
Node
. This makes the
DocumentFragment
very
 useful when the user wishes to create nodes that are siblings; the
DocumentFragment
acts as the parent of these nodes so that
 the user can use the standard methods from the
Node
interface, such as
Node.insertBefore
and
Node.appendChild
.
