Class LSException
java.lang.Object
java.lang.Throwable
java.lang.Exception
java.lang.RuntimeException
org.w3c.dom.ls.LSException
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
LSException
extends
RuntimeException
Parser or write operations may throw an
LSException
if the
 processing is stopped. The processing can be stopped due to a
DOMError
with a severity of
DOMError.SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR
or a non recovered
DOMError.SEVERITY_ERROR
, or if
DOMErrorHandler.handleError()
returned
false
.
Note:
As suggested in the definition of the constants in the
DOMError
interface, a DOM implementation may choose to
 continue after a fatal error, but the resulting DOM tree is then
 implementation dependent.

Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Load
and Save Specification
