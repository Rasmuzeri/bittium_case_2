Method Details
getRelatedNode
Node
getRelatedNode
()
relatedNode
is used to identify a secondary node related
 to a mutation event. For example, if a mutation event is dispatched
 to a node indicating that its parent has changed, the
relatedNode
is the changed parent. If an event is
 instead dispatched to a subtree indicating a node was changed within
 it, the
relatedNode
is the changed node. In the case of
 the DOMAttrModified event it indicates the
Attr
node
 which was modified, added, or removed.
getPrevValue
String
getPrevValue
()
prevValue
indicates the previous value of the
Attr
node in DOMAttrModified events, and of the
CharacterData
node in DOMCharacterDataModified events.
getNewValue
String
getNewValue
()
newValue
indicates the new value of the
Attr
node in DOMAttrModified events, and of the
CharacterData
node in DOMCharacterDataModified events.
getAttrName
String
getAttrName
()
attrName
indicates the name of the changed
Attr
node in a DOMAttrModified event.
getAttrChange
short
getAttrChange
()
attrChange
indicates the type of change which triggered
 the DOMAttrModified event. The values can be
MODIFICATION

initMutationEvent

Node
relatedNodeArg,
String
prevValueArg,
String

String
attrNameArg,
 short attrChangeArg)
The
initMutationEvent
method is used to initialize the
 value of a
MutationEvent
created through the
DocumentEvent
interface. This method may only be called
 before the
MutationEvent
has been dispatched via the
dispatchEvent
method, though it may be called multiple
 times during that phase if necessary. If called multiple times, the
 final invocation takes precedence.
Parameters:
typeArg
- Specifies the event type.
canBubbleArg
- Specifies whether or not the event can bubble.
cancelableArg
- Specifies whether or not the event's default
   action can be prevented.
relatedNodeArg
- Specifies the
Event
's related Node.
prevValueArg
- Specifies the
Event
's
prevValue
attribute. This value may be null.
newValueArg
- Specifies the
Event
's
newValue
attribute. This value may be null.
attrNameArg
- Specifies the
Event
's
attrName
attribute. This value may be null.
attrChangeArg
- Specifies the
Event
's
attrChange
attribute
