Interface DocumentEvent
public interface
DocumentEvent
The
DocumentEvent
interface provides a mechanism by which the
 user can create an Event of a type supported by the implementation. It is
 expected that the
DocumentEvent
interface will be
 implemented on the same object which implements the
Document
interface in an implementation which supports the Event model.
See also the
Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Events Specification
.
Since:
1.5, DOM Level 2

Parameters:
eventType
- The
eventType
parameter specifies the
   type of
Event
interface to be created. If the
Event
interface specified is supported by the
   implementation this method will return a new
Event
of
   the interface type requested. If the
Event
is to be
   dispatched via the
dispatchEvent
method the
   appropriate event init method must be called after creation in
   order to initialize the
Event
's values. As an example,
   a user wishing to synthesize some kind of
UIEvent
would call
createEvent
with the parameter "UIEvents".
   The
initUIEvent
method could then be called on the
   newly created
UIEvent
to set the specific type of
   UIEvent to be dispatched and set its context information.The
createEvent
method is used in creating
Event
s when it is either inconvenient or unnecessary
   for the user to create an
Event
themselves. In cases
   where the implementation provided
Event
is
   insufficient, users may supply their own
Event
implementations for use with the
dispatchEvent
method.
Returns:
The newly created
Event
Throws:
DOMException
- NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised if the implementation does not support the
   type of
Event
interface requested
