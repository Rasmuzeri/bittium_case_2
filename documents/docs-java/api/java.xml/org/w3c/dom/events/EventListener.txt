Interface EventListener
public interface
EventListener
The
EventListener
interface is the primary method for
 handling events. Users implement the
EventListener
interface
 and register their listener on an
EventTarget
using the
AddEventListener
method. The users should also remove their
EventListener
from its
EventTarget
after they
 have completed using the listener.
When a
Node
is copied using the
cloneNode
method the
EventListener
s attached to the source
Node
are not attached to the copied
Node
. If
 the user wishes the same
EventListener
s to be added to the
 newly created copy the user must add them manually.
