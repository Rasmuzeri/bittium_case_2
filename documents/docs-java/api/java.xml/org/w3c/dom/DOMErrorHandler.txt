Interface DOMErrorHandler
public interface
DOMErrorHandler
DOMErrorHandler
is a callback interface that the DOM
 implementation can call when reporting errors that happens while
 processing XML data, or when doing some other processing (e.g. validating
 a document). A
DOMErrorHandler
object can be attached to a
Document
using the "error-handler" on the
DOMConfiguration
interface. If more than one error needs to
 be reported during an operation, the sequence and numbers of the errors
 passed to the error handler are implementation dependent.
The application that is using the DOM implementation is expected to
 implement this interface.

This method is called on the error handler when an error occurs.
If an exception is thrown from this method, it is considered to be
 equivalent of returning

.
Parameters:
error
- The error object that describes the error. This object
   may be reused by the DOM implementation across multiple calls to
   the
handleError
method.
Returns:
If the
handleError
method returns
false
, the DOM implementation should stop the current
   processing when possible. If the method returns
true
,
   the processing may continue depending on
DOMError.severity
.
