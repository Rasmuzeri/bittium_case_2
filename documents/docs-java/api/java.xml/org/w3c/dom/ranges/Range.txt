 automatically merged. If the node to be inserted is a
 DocumentFragment node, the children will be inserted rather than the
 DocumentFragment node itself.

would end up with a child
   node of a type not allowed by the type of
node

detach
void
detach
()
     throws
DOMException
Called to indicate that the Range is no longer in use and that the
 implementation may relinquish any resources associated with this
 Range. Subsequent calls to any methods or attribute getters on this
 Range will result in a
DOMException
