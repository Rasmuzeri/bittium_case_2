Implementation Note
The JAXP APIs
JAXP comprises a set of APIs built upon a number of XML technologies and
 standards that are essential for XML processing. These include APIs for:
Parsing: the
JAXP Parsing API
based on
Document Object Model (DOM)
and
Simple API for XML Parsing (SAX)
, and
Streaming API for XML (StAX)
;
Serializing: StAX and
Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT)
;
Validation: the
JAXP Validation API
based on the XML Schema Definition Language;
Transformation: the
JAXP Transformation API
or XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations);
Querying and traversing XML documents: the
XML XPath Language API (XPath)
;
Resolving external resources: the
XML Catalog API
;
Factories and Processors
Factories are the entry points of each API, providing methods to allow applications
 to set
JAXP Properties
programmatically, before
 creating processors. The
Configuration
section provides more
 details on this. Factories also support the
JAXP Lookup Mechanism
, in which applications can be
 deployed with third party implementations to use instead of JDK implementations
Processors are aggregates of parsers (or readers), serializers (or writers),
 validators, and transformers that control and perform the processing in their
 respective areas. They are defined in their relevant packages.
 In the
parsers
package for example,
 are the
DocumentBuilder
and
SAXParser
, that represent the DOM and
 SAX processors.
The processors are configured and instantiated with their corresponding factories.
 The DocumentBuilder and SAXParser for example are constructed with the
DocumentBuilderFactory
and
SAXParserFactory
respectively.
Configuration
When a JAXP factory is invoked for the first time, it performs a configuration
 process to determine the implementation to be used and its subsequent behaviors.
 During configuration, the factory examines configuration sources such as the
JAXP Properties
,
System Properties
,
 and the
JAXP Configuration File
, and sets the values
 following the
Property Precedence
. The terminologies and
 process are defined below.
JAXP Properties
JAXP properties are configuration settings that are applied to XML processors.
 They can be used to control and customize the behavior of a processor.
 Depending on the JAXP API that is being used, JAXP properties may be referred
 to as
Attributes, Properties
, or
Features
.
System Properties
Select JAXP properties have corresponding System Properties allowing the properties
 to be set at runtime, on the command line, or within the
JAXP Configuration File
.
 For example, the System Property
javax.xml.catalog.resolve
may be used
 to set the
CatalogFeatures
' RESOLVE
 property.
The exact time at which system properties are read is unspecified. In order to
 ensure that the desired values are properly applied, applications should ensure
 that system properties are set appropriately prior to the creation of the first
 JAXP factory and are not modified thereafter.
Configuration File
JAXP supports the use of configuration files for
specifying the implementation class to load for the JAXP factories
as well as for setting JAXP properties.
Configuration files are Java
Properties
files that consist
 of mappings between system properties and their values defined by various APIs
 or processes. The following configuration file entries demonstrate setting the
javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory
and
CatalogFeatures.RESOLVE
properties:
Copy
javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory=packagename.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl
   javax.xml.catalog.resolve=strict
jaxp.properties
File
By default, JAXP looks for the configuration file
jaxp.properties
,
 located in the ${java.home}/conf directory; and if the file exists, loads the
 specified properties to customize the behavior of the XML factories and processors.
The
jaxp.properties
file will be read only once during the initialization
 of the JAXP implementation and cached in memory. If there is an error accessing
 or reading the file, the configuration process proceeds as if the file does not exist.
User-defined Configuration File
In addition to the
jaxp.properties
file, the system property
java.xml.config.file
can be set to specify the location of
 a configuration file. If the
java.xml.config.file
property is included
 within a configuration file, it will be ignored.
When the
java.xml.config.file
is specified, the configuration file will be
 read and the included properties will override the same properties that were
 defined in the
jaxp.properties
file. If the
java.xml.config.file
has not been set when the JAXP implementation is initialized, no further attempt
 will be made to check for its existence.
The
java.xml.config.file
value must contain a valid pathname
 to a configuration file. If the pathname is not absolute, it will be considered
 relative to the working directory of the JVM.
 If there is an error reading the configuration file, the configuration process
 proceeds as if the
java.xml.config.file
property was not set.
 Implementations may optionally issue a warning message.
Property Precedence
JAXP properties can be set in multiple ways, including by API methods, system
 properties, and the
JAXP Configuration File
. When not
 explicitly set, they will be initialized with default values or more restrictive
 values when
FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING
(FSP) is enabled. The configuration order of precedence for properties is as
 follows, from highest to lowest:
The APIs for factories or processors
System Property
User-defined
Configuration File
The default JAXP Configuration File
jaxp.properties
The default values for JAXP Properties. If the
FSP
is true,
 the default values will be set to process XML securely.
Using the
CatalogFeatures
' RESOLVE
 property as an example, the following illustrates how these rules are applied:
Properties specified with factory or processor APIs have the highest
 precedence. The following code effectively sets the RESOLVE property to
strict
, regardless of settings in any other configuration sources.
Copy
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
   dbf.setAttribute(CatalogFeatures.Feature.RESOLVE.getPropertyName(), "strict");
If the property is not set on the factory as in the above code, a
 system property setting will be in effect.
Copy
// in the following example, the RESOLVE property is set to 'continue'
    // for the entire application
    java -Djavax.xml.catalog.resolve=continue myApp
If the property is not set on the factory, or using a system property,
 the setting in a configuration file will take effect. The following entry
 sets the property to '
continue
'.
Copy
javax.xml.catalog.resolve=continue
If the property is not set anywhere, it will be resolved to its
 default value that is '
strict
'.
JAXP Lookup Mechanism
JAXP defines an ordered lookup procedure to determine the implementation class
 to load for the JAXP factories. Factories that support the mechanism are listed

Lookup Procedure
The order of precedence for locating the implementation class of a
JAXP Factory
is as follows, from highest to lowest:
The system property as listed in the column System Property of the table
JAXP Factories
above
The
Configuration File
The service-provider loading facility, defined by the
ServiceLoader
class, to attempt to locate and load an
 implementation of the service using the
default loading mechanism
:
 the service-provider loading facility will use the
current thread's context class loader
to attempt to load the service. If the context class
 loader is null, the
system class loader
will be used.
SchemaFactory
In case of the
SchemaFactory
,
 each potential service provider is required to implement the method
isSchemaLanguageSupported(String schemaLanguage)
.
 The first service provider found that supports the specified schema language
 is returned.
XPathFactory
In case of the
XPathFactory
,
 each potential service provider is required to implement the method
isObjectModelSupported(String objectModel)
.
 The first service provider found that supports the specified object model is
 returned.
Otherwise, the
system-default
implementation is returned, which is
 equivalent to calling the
newDefaultInstance() or newDefaultFactory()
method as shown in column System Default of the table
JAXP Factories
above.
SchemaFactory
In case of the
SchemaFactory
,
 there must be a
platform default
SchemaFactory
for W3C XML Schema.
XPathFactory
In case of the
XPathFactory
,
 there must be a
platform default
XPathFactory
for the W3C DOM, i.e.
DEFAULT_OBJECT_MODEL_URI
.

[1]
The full name of a property should be used to set the property.
[2]
A value "yes" indicates there is a corresponding System Property
 for the property, "no" otherwise. The name of the System Property is the same
 as that of the property.
[3]
The value must be exactly as listed in this table, case-sensitive.
 The value of the corresponding System Property is the String representation of
 the property value. If the type is boolean, the system property is true only
 if it is "true"; If the type is String, the system property is true only if
 it is exactly the same string representing the positive value (e.g. "yes" for
xsltcIsStandalone
); The system property is false otherwise. If the type
 is Integer, the value of the System Property is the String representation of
 the value (e.g. "64000" for
entityExpansionLimit
).
[4]
A value "yes" indicates the property is a Security Property. As indicated
 in the
Property Precedence
, the values listed in the column
enforced
will be used to initialize these properties when
FSP
is true.
[5]
One or more processors that support the property. The IDs and Set Method
 are as shown in the table
Processors
.
[6]
Indicates the initial release the property is introduced.
Legacy Property Names (deprecated)
JDK releases prior to JDK 17 support the use of URI style prefix for properties.
 These legacy property names are
deprecated
as of JDK 17 and may be removed
 in future releases. If both new and legacy properties are set, the new property
 names take precedence regardless of how and where they are set. The overriding order
 as defined in
Property Precedence
thus becomes:
Value set on factories or processors using new property names.
Value set on factories or processors using
legacy property names
;
Value set as System Property;
Value set in the configuration file;
Value set by FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING;
The default value;
The following table lists the properties and their corresponding legacy names.
