TransformerException
public
TransformerException
(
String
message)
Create a new TransformerException.
Parameters:
message
- The error or warning message.
TransformerException
public
TransformerException
(
Throwable
e)
Create a new TransformerException wrapping an existing exception.
Parameters:
e
- The exception to be wrapped.
TransformerException
public
TransformerException
(
String
message,
Throwable
e)
Wrap an existing exception in a TransformerException.
This is used for throwing processor exceptions before
 the processing has started.
Parameters:
message
- The error or warning message, or null to
                use the message from the embedded exception.
e
- Any exception
TransformerException
public
TransformerException
(
String
message,
SourceLocator
locator)
Create a new TransformerException from a message and a Locator.
This constructor is especially useful when an application is
 creating its own exception from within a DocumentHandler
 callback.
Parameters:
message
- The error or warning message.
locator
- The locator object for the error or warning.
TransformerException
public
TransformerException
(
String
message,
SourceLocator
locator,
Throwable
e)
Wrap an existing exception in a TransformerException.
Parameters:
message
- The error or warning message, or null to
                use the message from the embedded exception.
locator
- The locator object for the error or warning.
e
- Any exception
Method Details
getLocator
public
SourceLocator
getLocator
()
Method getLocator retrieves an instance of a SourceLocator
 object that specifies where an error occurred.
Returns:
A SourceLocator object, or null if none was specified.
setLocator
public
void
setLocator
(
SourceLocator
location)
Method setLocator sets an instance of a SourceLocator
 object that specifies where an error occurred.
Parameters:
location
- A SourceLocator object, or null to clear the location.
getException
public
Throwable
getException
()
This method retrieves an exception that this exception wraps.
Returns:
An Throwable object, or null.
See Also:
getCause()
getCause
public
Throwable
getCause
()
Returns the cause of this throwable or
null
if the
 cause is nonexistent or unknown.  (The cause is the throwable that
 caused this throwable to get thrown.)
Overrides:
getCause
in class
Throwable
Returns:
the cause, or null if unknown
initCause
public
Throwable
initCause
(
Throwable
cause)
Initializes the
cause
of this throwable to the specified value.
 (The cause is the throwable that caused this throwable to get thrown.)
This method can be called at most once.  It is generally called from
 within the constructor, or immediately after creating the
 throwable.  If this throwable was created
 with
TransformerException(Throwable)
or
TransformerException(String,Throwable)
, this method cannot be called
 even once.
Overrides:
initCause
in class
Throwable
Parameters:
cause
- the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the
getCause()
method).  (A
null
value is
         permitted, and indicates that the cause is nonexistent or
         unknown.)
Returns:
a reference to this
Throwable
instance.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
cause
is this
         throwable.  (A throwable cannot
         be its own cause.)
IllegalStateException
- if this throwable was
         created with
TransformerException(Throwable)
or
TransformerException(String,Throwable)
, or this method has already
         been called on this throwable.

Returns:
A string with location info, or null
 if there is no location information.
printStackTrace
public
