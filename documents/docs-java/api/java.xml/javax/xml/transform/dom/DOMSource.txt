Class DOMSource
java.lang.Object
javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMSource
All Implemented Interfaces:
Source
public class
DOMSource
extends
Object
implements
Source
Acts as a holder for a transformation Source tree in the
 form of a Document Object Model (DOM) tree.
Note that XSLT requires namespace support. Attempting to transform a DOM
 that was not constructed with a namespace-aware parser may result in errors.
 Parsers can be made namespace aware by calling
DocumentBuilderFactory.setNamespaceAware(boolean awareness)
.
Since:
1.4

Constructor Details
DOMSource
public
DOMSource
()
Zero-argument default constructor.  If this constructor is used, and
 no DOM source is set using
setNode(Node node)
, then the
Transformer
will
 create an empty source
Document
using
DocumentBuilder.newDocument()
.
See Also:
Transformer.transform(Source xmlSource, Result outputTarget)
DOMSource
public
DOMSource
(
Node
n)
Create a new input source with a DOM node.  The operation
 will be applied to the subtree rooted at this node.  In XSLT,
 a "/" pattern still means the root of the tree (not the subtree),
 and the evaluation of global variables and parameters is done
 from the root node also.
Parameters:
n
- The DOM node that will contain the Source tree.
DOMSource
public
DOMSource
(
Node
node,
String
systemID)
Create a new input source with a DOM node, and with the
 system ID also passed in as the base URI.
Parameters:
node
- The DOM node that will contain the Source tree.
systemID
- Specifies the base URI associated with node.
Method Details
setNode
public
void
setNode
(
Node
node)
Set the node that will represents a Source DOM tree.
Parameters:
node
- The node that is to be transformed.
getNode
public
Node
getNode
()
Get the node that represents a Source DOM tree.
Returns:
The node that is to be transformed.
setSystemId
public
void
setSystemId
(
String
systemID)
Set the base ID (URL or system ID) from where URLs
 will be resolved.
Specified by:
setSystemId
in interface
Source
Parameters:
systemID
- Base URL for this DOM tree.
getSystemId
public
String
getSystemId
()
Get the base ID (URL or system ID) from where URLs
 will be resolved.
Specified by:
getSystemId
in interface
Source
Returns:
Base URL for this DOM tree.
isEmpty
public
boolean
isEmpty
()
Indicates whether the
DOMSource
object is empty. Empty is
 defined as follows:
if the system identifier and node are
null
;
if the system identifier is null, and the
node
has no child nodes.
Specified by:
isEmpty
in interface
Source
Returns:
true if the
DOMSource
object is empty, false otherwise
