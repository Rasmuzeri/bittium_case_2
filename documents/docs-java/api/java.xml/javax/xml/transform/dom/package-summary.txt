Package javax.xml.transform.dom
package
javax.xml.transform.dom
Provides DOM specific transformation classes.
The
DOMSource
class allows the
 client of the implementation of this API to specify a DOM
Node
as the source of the input tree. The model of
 how the Transformer deals with the DOM tree in terms of mismatches with the
XSLT data model
or
 other data models is beyond the scope of this document. Any of the nodes
 derived from
Node
are legal input.
The
DOMResult
class allows
 a
Node
to be specified to which result DOM nodes will
 be appended. If an output node is not specified, the transformer will use
DocumentBuilder.newDocument()
to create an
 output
Document
node. If a node is specified, it
 should be one of the following:
Document
,
Element
, or
DocumentFragment
. Specification of any other node
 type is implementation dependent and undefined by this API. If the result is a
Document
, the output of the transformation must have
 a single element root to set as the document element.
The
DOMLocator
node may be passed
 to
TransformerException
objects, and
 retrieved by trying to cast the result of the
TransformerException.getLocator()
method.
 The implementation has no responsibility to use a DOMLocator instead of a
SourceLocator
(though line numbers and the
 like do not make much sense for a DOM), so the result of getLocator must always
 be tested with an instanceof.
