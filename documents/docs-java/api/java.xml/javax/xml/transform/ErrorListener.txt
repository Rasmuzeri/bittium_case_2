Interface ErrorListener
public interface
ErrorListener
The listener interface used by a
TransformerFactory
or
Transformer
to notify callers of error messages that occur during a transformation process.
 An ErrorListener receives three levels of messages: warnings, errors and fatal
 errors as classified by their severity. Each of them is handled as described
 in their respective method.
An ErrorListener instance can be registered to a
TransformerFactory
or
Transformer
through
 the
TransformerFactory.setErrorListener(ErrorListener)
or
Transformer.setErrorListener(ErrorListener)
method to receive errors and warnings reported by the TransformerFactory
 or Transformer.
When a listener is registered, the
TransformerFactory
or
Transformer
must use this interface to pass on all warnings and errors to the listener
 and let the application decide how to handle them.
 Note that the
TransformerFactory
or
Transformer
is not
 required to continue with the transformation after a call to
fatalError(TransformerException exception)
.
If an application does not provide a listener, the
TransformerFactory
or
Transformer
shall create one on its own. The default
ErrorListener
may take no action for warnings and recoverable errors, and allow the
 transformation to continue.
 However, the
TransformerFactory
or
Transformer
may still throw
TransformerException
when it decides it can not continue processing.
API Note:
It is recommended that applications register and use their own
ErrorListener
to override the default behavior in order to ensure
 proper handling of warnings and errors.

Modifier and Type
Method
Description
void

exception)
Receive notification of a recoverable error.
void

exception)
Receive notification of a non-recoverable error.

exception)
Receive notification of a warning.
Method Details
warning
void
warning
(
TransformerException
exception)
throws
TransformerException
Receive notification of a warning.
Transformer
can use this method to report
 conditions that are not errors or fatal errors.  The default behaviour
 is to take no action.
After invoking this method, the Transformer must continue with
 the transformation. It should still be possible for the
 application to process the document through to the end.
Parameters:
exception
- The warning information encapsulated in a
                  transformer exception.
Throws:
TransformerException
- if the application
 chooses to discontinue the transformation.
See Also:
TransformerException
error
void
error
(
TransformerException
exception)
throws
TransformerException
Receive notification of a recoverable error.
The transformer must continue to try and provide normal transformation
 after invoking this method.  It should still be possible for the
 application to process the document through to the end if no other errors
 are encountered.
Parameters:
exception
- The error information encapsulated in a
                  transformer exception.
Throws:
TransformerException
- if the application
 chooses to discontinue the transformation.
See Also:
TransformerException
fatalError
void
fatalError
(
TransformerException
exception)
throws
TransformerException
Receive notification of a non-recoverable error.
The processor may choose to continue, but will not normally
 proceed to a successful completion.
The method should throw an exception if it is unable to
 process the error, or if it wishes execution to terminate
 immediately. The processor will not necessarily honor this
 request.
Parameters:
exception
- The error information encapsulated in a
TransformerException
.
Throws:
TransformerException
- if the application
 chooses to discontinue the transformation.
