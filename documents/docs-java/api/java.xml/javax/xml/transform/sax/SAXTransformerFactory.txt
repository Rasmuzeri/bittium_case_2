Class SAXTransformerFactory
java.lang.Object
javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory
javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory
public abstract class
SAXTransformerFactory
extends
TransformerFactory
This class extends TransformerFactory to provide SAX-specific
 factory methods.  It provides two types of ContentHandlers,
 one for creating Transformers, the other for creating Templates
 objects.
If an application wants to set the ErrorHandler or EntityResolver
 for an XMLReader used during a transformation, it should use a URIResolver
 to return the SAXSource which provides (with getXMLReader) a reference to
 the XMLReader.

newTransformerHandler
(
Source

throws
TransformerConfigurationException
Get a TransformerHandler object that can process SAX
 ContentHandler events into a Result, based on the transformation
 instructions specified by the argument.
Parameters:
src
- The Source of the transformation instructions.
Returns:
TransformerHandler ready to transform SAX events.
Throws:
TransformerConfigurationException
- If for some reason the
 TransformerHandler can not be created.
newTransformerHandler

Templates
templates)
throws
TransformerConfigurationException
Get a TransformerHandler object that can process SAX
 ContentHandler events into a Result, based on the Templates argument.
Parameters:
templates
- The compiled transformation instructions.
Returns:
TransformerHandler ready to transform SAX events.
Throws:
TransformerConfigurationException
- If for some reason the
 TransformerHandler can not be created.

()
                                                  throws
TransformerConfigurationException
Get a TransformerHandler object that can process SAX
 ContentHandler events into a Result. The transformation
 is defined as an identity (or copy) transformation, for example
 to copy a series of SAX parse events into a DOM tree.
Returns:
A non-null reference to a TransformerHandler, that may
 be used as a ContentHandler for SAX parse events.
Throws:
TransformerConfigurationException
- If for some reason the
 TransformerHandler cannot be created.

newTemplatesHandler
()
                                              throws
TransformerConfigurationException
Get a TemplatesHandler object that can process SAX
 ContentHandler events into a Templates object.
Returns:
A non-null reference to a TransformerHandler, that may
 be used as a ContentHandler for SAX parse events.
Throws:
TransformerConfigurationException
- If for some reason the
 TemplatesHandler cannot be created.
newXMLFilter
public abstract
XMLFilter
newXMLFilter
(
Source
src)
throws
TransformerConfigurationException
Create an XMLFilter that uses the given Source as the
 transformation instructions.
Parameters:
src
- The Source of the transformation instructions.
Returns:
An XMLFilter object, or null if this feature is not supported.
Throws:
TransformerConfigurationException
- If for some reason the
 TemplatesHandler cannot be created.
newXMLFilter
public abstract
XMLFilter
newXMLFilter
(
Templates
templates)
throws
TransformerConfigurationException
Create an XMLFilter, based on the Templates argument..
Parameters:
templates
- The compiled transformation instructions.
Returns:
An XMLFilter object, or null if this feature is not supported.
Throws:
TransformerConfigurationException
- If for some reason the
 TemplatesHandler cannot be created.
