Interface Templates
public interface
Templates
An object that implements this interface is the runtime representation of processed
 transformation instructions.
Templates must be threadsafe for a given instance
 over multiple threads running concurrently, and may
 be used multiple times in a given session.
Since:
1.4

Method
Description
Properties
getOutputProperties
()
Get the properties corresponding to the effective xsl:output element.
Transformer
newTransformer
()
Create a new transformation context for this Templates object.
Method Details
newTransformer
Transformer
newTransformer
()
                    throws
TransformerConfigurationException
Create a new transformation context for this Templates object.
Returns:
A valid non-null instance of a Transformer.
Throws:
TransformerConfigurationException
- if a Transformer can not be created.
getOutputProperties
Properties
getOutputProperties
()
Get the properties corresponding to the effective xsl:output element.
 The object returned will
 be a clone of the internal values. Accordingly, it can be mutated
 without mutating the Templates object, and then handed in to
Transformer.setOutputProperties(java.util.Properties)
.
The properties returned should contain properties set by the stylesheet,
 and these properties are "defaulted" by default properties specified by
section 16 of the
 XSL Transformations (XSLT) W3C Recommendation
.  The properties that
 were specifically set by the stylesheet should be in the base
 Properties list, while the XSLT default properties that were not
 specifically set should be in the "default" Properties list.  Thus,
 getOutputProperties().getProperty(String key) will obtain any
 property in that was set by the stylesheet,
or
the default
 properties, while
 getOutputProperties().get(String key) will only retrieve properties
 that were explicitly set in the stylesheet.
For XSLT,
Attribute
 Value Templates
attribute values will
 be returned unexpanded (since there is no context at this point).  The
 namespace prefixes inside Attribute Value Templates will be unexpanded,
 so that they remain valid XPath values.
Returns:
A Properties object, never null.
