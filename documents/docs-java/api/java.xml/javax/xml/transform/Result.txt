String
PI_DISABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING
The name of the processing instruction that is sent if the
 result tree disables output escaping.
Normally, result tree serialization escapes& and < (and
 possibly other characters) when outputting text nodes.
 This ensures that the output is well-formed XML. However,
 it is sometimes convenient to be able to produce output that is
 almost, but not quite well-formed XML; for example,
 the output may include ill-formed sections that will
 be transformed into well-formed XML by a subsequent non-XML aware
 process. If a processing instruction is sent with this name,
 serialization should be output without any escaping.
Result DOM trees may also have PI_DISABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING and
 PI_ENABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING inserted into the tree.

Method Details
setSystemId
void
setSystemId
(
String
systemId)
Set the system identifier for this Result.
If the Result is not to be written to a file, the system identifier is optional.
 The application may still want to provide one, however, for use in error messages
 and warnings, or to resolve relative output identifiers.
Parameters:
systemId
- The system identifier as a URI string.
getSystemId
String
getSystemId
()
Get the system identifier that was set with setSystemId.
Returns:
The system identifier that was set with setSystemId,
 or null if setSystemId was not called.
