Constructor Details
StreamResult
public
StreamResult
()
Zero-argument default constructor.
StreamResult
public
StreamResult
(
OutputStream
outputStream)
Construct a StreamResult from a byte stream.  Normally,
 a stream should be used rather than a reader, so that
 the transformer may use instructions contained in the
 transformation instructions to control the encoding.
Parameters:
outputStream
- A valid OutputStream reference.
StreamResult
public
StreamResult
(
Writer
writer)
Construct a StreamResult from a character stream.  Normally,
 a stream should be used rather than a reader, so that
 the transformer may use instructions contained in the
 transformation instructions to control the encoding.  However,
 there are times when it is useful to write to a character
 stream, such as when using a StringWriter.
Parameters:
writer
- A valid Writer reference.
StreamResult
public
StreamResult
(
String
systemId)
Construct a StreamResult from a URL.
Parameters:
systemId
- Must be a String that conforms to the URI syntax.
StreamResult
public
StreamResult
(
File
f)
Construct a StreamResult from a File.
Parameters:
f
- Must a non-null File reference.
Method Details
setOutputStream
public
void
setOutputStream
(
OutputStream
outputStream)
Set the ByteStream that is to be written to.  Normally,
 a stream should be used rather than a reader, so that
 the transformer may use instructions contained in the
 transformation instructions to control the encoding.
Parameters:
outputStream
- A valid OutputStream reference.
getOutputStream
public
OutputStream
getOutputStream
()
Get the byte stream that was set with setOutputStream.
Returns:
The byte stream that was set with setOutputStream, or null
 if setOutputStream or the ByteStream constructor was not called.
setWriter
public
void
setWriter
(
Writer
writer)
Set the writer that is to receive the result.  Normally,
 a stream should be used rather than a writer, so that
 the transformer may use instructions contained in the
 transformation instructions to control the encoding.  However,
 there are times when it is useful to write to a writer,
 such as when using a StringWriter.
Parameters:
writer
- A valid Writer reference.
getWriter
public
Writer
getWriter
()
Get the character stream that was set with setWriter.
Returns:
The character stream that was set with setWriter, or null
 if setWriter or the Writer constructor was not called.
setSystemId
public
void
setSystemId
(
String
systemId)
Set the systemID that may be used in association
 with the byte or character stream, or, if neither is set, use
 this value as a writeable URI (probably a file name).
Specified by:
setSystemId
in interface
Result
Parameters:
systemId
- The system identifier as a URI string.
setSystemId
public
void
setSystemId
(
File
f)
Set the system ID from a
File
reference.
Parameters:
f
- Must a non-null File reference.
getSystemId
public
String
getSystemId
()
Get the system identifier that was set with setSystemId.
Specified by:
getSystemId
in interface
Result
Returns:
The system identifier that was set with setSystemId, or null
 if setSystemId was not called.
