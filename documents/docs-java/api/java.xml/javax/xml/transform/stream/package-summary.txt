Package javax.xml.transform.stream
package
javax.xml.transform.stream
Provides stream and URI specific transformation classes.
The
StreamSource
class
 provides methods for specifying
InputStream
input,
Reader
input, and URL input in the form of strings. Even
 if an input stream or reader is specified as the source,
StreamSource.setSystemId(java.lang.String)
should still
 be called, so that the transformer can know from where it should resolve
 relative URIs. The public identifier is always optional: if the application
 writer includes one, it will be provided as part of the
SourceLocator
information.
The
StreamResult
class
 provides methods for specifying
OutputStream
,
Writer
, or an output system ID, as the output of the
 transformation result.
Normally streams should be used rather than readers or writers, for
 both the Source and Result, since readers and writers already have the encoding
 established to and from the internal Unicode format. However, there are times
 when it is useful to write to a character stream, such as when using a
 StringWriter in order to write to a String, or in the case of reading source
 XML from a StringReader.
