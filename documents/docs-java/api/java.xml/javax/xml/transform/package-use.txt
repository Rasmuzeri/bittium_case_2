Description
Result
An object that implements this interface contains the information
 needed to build a transformation result tree.
Source
An object that implements this interface contains the information
 needed to act as source input (XML source or transformation instructions).

Class
Description
ErrorListener
The listener interface used by a
TransformerFactory
or
Transformer
to notify callers of error messages that occur during a transformation process.
Result
An object that implements this interface contains the information
 needed to build a transformation result tree.
Source
An object that implements this interface contains the information
 needed to act as source input (XML source or transformation instructions).
SourceLocator
This interface is primarily for the purposes of reporting where
 an error occurred in the XML source or transformation instructions.
Templates
An object that implements this interface is the runtime representation of processed
 transformation instructions.
Transformer
An instance of this abstract class can transform a
 source tree into a result tree.
TransformerConfigurationException
Indicates a serious configuration error.
TransformerException
This class specifies an exceptional condition that occurred
 during the transformation process.
TransformerFactory
A TransformerFactory instance can be used to create
Transformer
and
Templates
objects.
TransformerFactoryConfigurationError
Thrown when a problem with configuration with the Transformer Factories
 exists.
URIResolver
An object that implements this interface that can be called by the processor
 to turn a URI used in document(), xsl:import, or xsl:include into a Source object.
