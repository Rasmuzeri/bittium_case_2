Interface XPathFunctionResolver
public interface
XPathFunctionResolver
XPathFunctionResolver
provides access to the set of user defined
XPathFunction
s.
XPath functions are resolved by name and arity.
 The resolver is not needed for XPath built-in functions and the resolver
cannot
be used to override those functions.
In particular, the resolver is only called for functions in an another
 namespace (functions with an explicit prefix). This means that you cannot
 use the
XPathFunctionResolver
to implement specifications
 like
XML-Signature Syntax
 and Processing
which extend the function library of XPath 1.0 in the
 same namespace. This is a consequence of the design of the resolver.
If you wish to implement additional built-in functions, you will have to
 extend the underlying implementation directly.
Since:
1.5
