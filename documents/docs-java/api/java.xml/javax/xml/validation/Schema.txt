Class Schema
java.lang.Object
javax.xml.validation.Schema
public abstract class
Schema
extends
Object
Immutable in-memory representation of grammar.
This object represents a set of constraints that can be checked/
 enforced against an XML document.
A
Schema
object is thread safe and applications are
 encouraged to share it across many parsers in many threads.
A
Schema
object is immutable in the sense that it shouldn't
 change the set of constraints once it is created. In other words,
 if an application validates the same document twice against the same
Schema
, it must always produce the same result.
A
Schema
object is usually created from
SchemaFactory
.
Two kinds of validators can be created from a
Schema
object.
 One is
Validator
, which provides highly-level validation
 operations that cover typical use cases. The other is
ValidatorHandler
, which works on top of SAX for better
 modularity.
This specification does not refine
 the
Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
method.
 In other words, if you parse the same schema twice, you may
 still get
!schemaA.equals(schemaB)
.

Constructor for the derived class.
The constructor does nothing.
Method Details
newValidator
public abstract
Validator
newValidator
()
Creates a new
Validator
for this
Schema
.
A validator enforces/checks the set of constraints this object
 represents.
Implementors should assure that the properties set on the
SchemaFactory
that created this
Schema
are also
 set on the
Validator
constructed.
Returns:
Always return a non-null valid object.
newValidatorHandler
public abstract
ValidatorHandler
newValidatorHandler
()
Creates a new
ValidatorHandler
for this
Schema
.
Implementors should assure that the properties set on the
SchemaFactory
that created this
Schema
are also
 set on the
ValidatorHandler
constructed.
Returns:
Always return a non-null valid object.
