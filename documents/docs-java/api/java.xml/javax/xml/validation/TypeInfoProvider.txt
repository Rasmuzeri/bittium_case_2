Class TypeInfoProvider
java.lang.Object
javax.xml.validation.TypeInfoProvider
public abstract class
TypeInfoProvider
extends
Object
This class provides access to the type information determined
 by
ValidatorHandler
.
Some schema languages, such as W3C XML Schema, encourages a validator
 to report the "type" it assigns to each attribute/element.
 Those applications who wish to access this type information can invoke
 methods defined on this "interface" to access such type information.
Implementation of this "interface" can be obtained through the
ValidatorHandler.getTypeInfoProvider()
method.
Since:
1.5

Method Details
getElementTypeInfo
public abstract
TypeInfo
getElementTypeInfo
()
Returns the immutable
TypeInfo
object for the current
 element.
The method may only be called by the startElement event
 or the endElement event
 of the
ContentHandler
that the application sets to
 the
ValidatorHandler
.
When W3C XML Schema validation is being performed, in the
 case where an element has a union type, the
TypeInfo
returned by a call to
getElementTypeInfo()
from the
 startElement
 event will be the union type. The
TypeInfo
returned by a call
 from the endElement event will be the actual member type used
 to validate the element.
Returns:
An immutable
TypeInfo
object that represents the
      type of the current element.
      Note that the caller can keep references to the obtained
TypeInfo
longer than the callback scope.

      Otherwise, this method returns
      null if the validator is unable to
      determine the type of the current element for some reason
      (for example, if the validator is recovering from
      an earlier error.)
Throws:
IllegalStateException
- If this method is called from other
ContentHandler
methods.
getAttributeTypeInfo
public abstract
TypeInfo
getAttributeTypeInfo
(int index)
Returns the immutable
TypeInfo
object for the specified
 attribute of the current element.
The method may only be called by the startElement event of
 the
ContentHandler
that the application sets to the
ValidatorHandler
.
Parameters:
index
- The index of the attribute. The same index for
      the
Attributes
object passed to the
startElement
callback.
Returns:
An immutable
TypeInfo
object that represents the
      type of the specified attribute.
      Note that the caller can keep references to the obtained
TypeInfo
longer than the callback scope.

      Otherwise, this method returns
      null if the validator is unable to
      determine the type.
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- If the index is invalid.
IllegalStateException
- If this method is called from other
ContentHandler
methods.
isIdAttribute
public abstract
boolean
isIdAttribute
(int index)
Returns
true
if the specified attribute is determined
 to be ID.
Exactly how an attribute is "determined to be ID" is up to the
 schema language. In case of W3C XML Schema, this means
 that the actual type of the attribute is the built-in ID type
 or its derived type.
A
DocumentBuilder
uses this information
 to properly implement
Attr.isId()
.
The method may only be called by the startElement event of
 the
ContentHandler
that the application sets to the
ValidatorHandler
.
Parameters:
index
- The index of the attribute. The same index for
      the
Attributes
object passed to the
startElement
callback.
Returns:
true
      if the type of the specified attribute is ID.
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- If the index is invalid.
IllegalStateException
- If this method is called from other
ContentHandler
methods.
isSpecified
public abstract
boolean
isSpecified
(int index)
Returns
false
if the attribute was added by the validator.
This method provides information necessary for
 a
DocumentBuilder
to determine what
 the DOM tree should return from the
Attr.getSpecified()
method.
The method may only be called by the startElement event of
 the
ContentHandler
that the application sets to the
ValidatorHandler
.
A general guideline for validators is to return true if
 the attribute was originally present in the pipeline, and
 false if it was added by the validator.
Parameters:
index
- The index of the attribute. The same index for
      the
Attributes
object passed to the
startElement
callback.
Returns:
true
if the attribute was present before the validator
      processes input.
false
if the attribute was added
      by the validator.
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- If the index is invalid.
IllegalStateException
- If this method is called from other
ContentHandler
methods.
