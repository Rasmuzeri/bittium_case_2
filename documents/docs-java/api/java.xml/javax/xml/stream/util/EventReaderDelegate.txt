All Implemented Interfaces:

public class
EventReaderDelegate
extends
Object
implements
XMLEventReader
This is the base class for deriving an XMLEventReader
 filter.

 This class is designed to sit between an XMLEventReader and an
 application's XMLEventReader.  By default each method
 does nothing but call the corresponding method on the
 parent interface.
Since:
1.6

StartDocument
.
Specified by:
nextEvent
in interface
XMLEventReader
Returns:
the next XMLEvent
Throws:
XMLStreamException
- if there is an error with the underlying XML.

XMLStreamException
Description copied from interface:
XMLEventReader
Frees any resources associated with this Reader.  This method does not close the
 underlying input source.
Specified by:
close
in interface
XMLEventReader
Throws:
XMLStreamException
- if there are errors freeing associated resources
getElementText
public
String
getElementText
()
                      throws
XMLStreamException
Description copied from interface:
XMLEventReader
Reads the content of a text-only element. Precondition:
 the current event is START_ELEMENT. Postcondition:
 The current event is the corresponding END_ELEMENT.
Specified by:
getElementText
in interface
XMLEventReader
Returns:
the text of the element
Throws:
XMLStreamException
- if the current event is not a START_ELEMENT
 or if a non text element is encountered
nextTag
public
XMLEvent
nextTag
()
                 throws
XMLStreamException
Description copied from interface:
XMLEventReader
Skips any insignificant space events until a START_ELEMENT or
 END_ELEMENT is reached. If anything other than space characters are
 encountered, an exception is thrown. This method should
 be used when processing element-only content because
 the parser is not able to recognize ignorable whitespace if
 the DTD is missing or not interpreted.
Specified by:
nextTag
in interface
XMLEventReader
Returns:
a START_ELEMENT or END_ELEMENT
Throws:
XMLStreamException
- if anything other than space characters are encountered
getProperty
public

IllegalArgumentException
Description copied from interface:
XMLEventReader
Get the value of a feature/property from the underlying implementation
Specified by:
getProperty
in interface
XMLEventReader
Parameters:
name
- The name of the property
Returns:
The value of the property
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the property is not supported
