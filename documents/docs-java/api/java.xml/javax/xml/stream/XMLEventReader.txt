Method Details
nextEvent
XMLEvent
nextEvent
()
            throws
XMLStreamException
Gets the next XMLEvent. The initial event is
StartDocument
.
Returns:
the next XMLEvent
Throws:
XMLStreamException
- if there is an error with the underlying XML.
NoSuchElementException
- iteration has no more elements.

XMLEvent
hasNext
boolean
hasNext
()
Check if there are more events.
 Returns true if there are more events and false otherwise.
Specified by:
hasNext
in interface
Iterator
<
Object
>
Returns:
true if the event reader has more events, false otherwise
peek
XMLEvent
peek
()
       throws
XMLStreamException
Check the next XMLEvent without reading it from the stream.
 Returns null if the stream is at EOF or has no more XMLEvents.
 A call to peek() will be equal to the next return of next().
Returns:
the next XMLEvent
Throws:
XMLStreamException
- if an error occurs

getElementText
String
getElementText
()
               throws
XMLStreamException
Reads the content of a text-only element. Precondition:
 the current event is START_ELEMENT. Postcondition:
 The current event is the corresponding END_ELEMENT.
Returns:
the text of the element
Throws:
XMLStreamException
- if the current event is not a START_ELEMENT
 or if a non text element is encountered
nextTag
XMLEvent
nextTag
()
          throws
XMLStreamException
Skips any insignificant space events until a START_ELEMENT or
 END_ELEMENT is reached. If anything other than space characters are
 encountered, an exception is thrown. This method should
 be used when processing element-only content because
 the parser is not able to recognize ignorable whitespace if
 the DTD is missing or not interpreted.
Returns:
a START_ELEMENT or END_ELEMENT
Throws:
XMLStreamException
- if anything other than space characters are encountered
getProperty
Object

(
String
