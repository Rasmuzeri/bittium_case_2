Package javax.xml.stream
package
javax.xml.stream
Defines interfaces and classes for the Streaming API for XML (StAX).
StAX provides two basic functions: the cursor API allowing users to
 read and write XML efficiently, and the event iterator API promoting
 ease of use that is event based, easy to extend and pipeline.
 The event iterator API is intended to layer on top of the cursor API.
The cursor API defines two interfaces:
XMLStreamReader
and
XMLStreamWriter
, while the event iterator API defines:
XMLEventReader
and
XMLEventWriter
.
StAX supports plugability with
XMLInputFactory
and
XMLOutputFactory
that define how an implementation is
 located through a process as described in the
newFactory
methods.
Since:
