Catalog
catalog
(
CatalogFeatures
features,
URI
... uris)
Creates a
Catalog
object using the specified feature settings and
 uri(s) to one or more catalog files.
If
uris
is empty, system property
javax.xml.catalog.files
,
 as defined in
CatalogFeatures
, will be read to locate the initial
 list of catalog files.
If multiple catalog files are specified through the
uris
argument or
javax.xml.catalog.files
property, the first entry is considered
 the main catalog, while others are treated as alternative catalogs after
 those referenced by the
nextCatalog
elements in the main catalog.
As specified in
XML Catalogs, OASIS Standard V1.1
, if a catalog entry is invalid, it
 is ignored. In case all entries are invalid, the resulting Catalog object
 will contain no Catalog elements. Any matching operation using the Catalog
 will return null.
Parameters:
features
- the catalog features
uris
- uri(s) to one or more catalogs.
Returns:
an instance of a
Catalog
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if either the URIs are not absolute
 or do not have a URL protocol handler for the URI scheme
CatalogException
- If an error occurs while parsing the catalog
SecurityException
- if access to the resource is denied by the security manager
catalogResolver

catalogResolver

catalogResolver
(
CatalogFeatures
features,
URI
... uris)
Creates an instance of a
CatalogResolver
using the specified feature
 settings and uri(s) to one or more catalog files.
If
uris
is empty, system property
javax.xml.catalog.files
,
 as defined in
CatalogFeatures
, will be read to locate the initial
 list of catalog files.
If multiple catalog files are specified through the
uris
argument or
javax.xml.catalog.files
property, the first entry is considered
 the main catalog, while others are treated as alternative catalogs after
 those referenced by the
nextCatalog
elements in the main catalog.
As specified in
XML Catalogs, OASIS Standard V1.1
, if a catalog entry is invalid, it
 is ignored. In case all entries are invalid, the resulting CatalogResolver
 object will contain no valid catalog. Any resolution operation using the
 resolver therefore will return as no mapping is found. See
CatalogResolver
for the behavior when no mapping is found.
Parameters:
features
- the catalog features
uris
- the uri(s) to one or more catalogs
Returns:
an instance of a
CatalogResolver
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if either the URIs are not absolute
 or do not have a URL protocol handler for the URI scheme
CatalogException
- If an error occurs while parsing the catalog
SecurityException
- if access to the resource is denied by the security manager
