Interface Catalog

Catalog
The Catalog class represents an entity Catalog as defined by
XML Catalogs, OASIS Standard V1.1, 7 October 2005
.
A catalog is an XML file that contains a root
catalog
entry with a list
 of catalog entries. The entries can also be grouped with a
group
entry.
 The catalog and group entries may specify
prefer
and
xml:base
attributes that set preference of public or system type of entries and base URI
 to resolve relative URIs.
A catalog can be used in two situations:
Locate the external resources with a public or system identifier;
Locate an alternate URI reference with a URI.
For case 1, the standard defines 6 External Identifier Entries:
public, system, rewriteSystem, systemSuffix, delegatePublic, and
 delegateSystem
.
While for case 2, it defines 4 URI Entries:
uri, rewriteURI, uriSuffix and delegateURI
.
In addition to the above entry types, a catalog may define nextCatalog
 entries to add additional catalog entry files.

Description
Stream
<
Catalog
>
catalogs
()
Returns a sequential Stream of alternative Catalogs specified using the
nextCatalog
entries in the current catalog, and as the input of
 catalog files excluding the current catalog (that is, the first in the
 input list) when the Catalog object is created by the
CatalogManager
.
String
matchPublic
(
String
publicId)
Attempts to find a matching entry in the catalog by publicId.
String
matchSystem
(
String
systemId)
Attempts to find a matching entry in the catalog by systemId.
String
matchURI
(
String
uri)
Attempts to find a matching entry in the catalog by the uri element.
Method Details
matchSystem
String
matchSystem
(
String
systemId)
Attempts to find a matching entry in the catalog by systemId.
The method searches through the system-type entries, including
system,
 rewriteSystem, systemSuffix, delegateSystem
, and
group
entries in the
 current catalog in order to find a match.
Resolution follows the steps listed below:
If a matching
system
entry exists, it is returned immediately.
If more than one
rewriteSystem
entry matches, the matching entry with
 the longest normalized
systemIdStartString
value is returned.
If more than one
systemSuffix
entry matches, the matching entry
 with the longest normalized
systemIdSuffix
value is returned.
If more than one
delegateSystem
entry matches, the matching entry
 with the longest matching
systemIdStartString
value is returned.
Parameters:
systemId
- the system identifier of the entity to be matched
Returns:
a URI string if a mapping is found, or null otherwise
matchPublic
String
matchPublic
(
String
publicId)
Attempts to find a matching entry in the catalog by publicId. The method
 searches through the public-type entries, including
public,
 delegatePublic
, and
group
entries in the current catalog in order to find
 a match.
Refer to the description about
Feature PREFER in the table Catalog Features
in class
CatalogFeatures
. Public entries are only considered if the
prefer
is
public
and
system
entries are not found.
Resolution follows the steps listed below:
If a matching
public
entry is found, it is returned immediately.
If more than one
delegatePublic
entry matches, the matching entry
 with the longest matching
publicIdStartString
value is returned.
Parameters:
publicId
- the public identifier of the entity to be matched
Returns:
a URI string if a mapping is found, or null otherwise

CatalogFeatures.Feature
matchURI
String
matchURI
(
String
uri)
Attempts to find a matching entry in the catalog by the uri element.
The method searches through the uri-type entries, including
uri,
 rewriteURI, uriSuffix, delegateURI
and
group
entries in the current
 catalog in order to find a match.
Resolution follows the steps listed below:
If a matching
uri
entry is found, it is returned immediately.
If more than one
rewriteURI
entry matches, the matching entry with
 the longest normalized
uriStartString
value is returned.
If more than one
uriSuffix
entry matches, the matching entry with
 the longest normalized
uriSuffix
value is returned.
If more than one
delegatePublic
entry matches, the matching entry
 with the longest matching
uriStartString
value is returned.
Parameters:
uri
- the URI reference of the entity to be matched
Returns:
a URI string if a mapping is found, or null otherwise
catalogs
Stream
<
Catalog
>
catalogs
()
Returns a sequential Stream of alternative Catalogs specified using the
nextCatalog
entries in the current catalog, and as the input of
 catalog files excluding the current catalog (that is, the first in the
 input list) when the Catalog object is created by the
CatalogManager
.
The order of Catalogs in the returned stream is the same as the order
 in which the corresponding
nextCatalog
entries appear in the
 current catalog. The alternative catalogs from the input file list are
 appended to the end of the stream in the order they are entered.
Returns:
a sequential Stream of Catalogs
