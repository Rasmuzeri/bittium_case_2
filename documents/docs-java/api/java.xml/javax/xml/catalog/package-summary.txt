Package javax.xml.catalog
package
javax.xml.catalog
Provides the classes for implementing
XML Catalogs OASIS Standard V1.1, 7 October 2005
.
The Catalog API defines a standard solution for resolving external resources
 referenced by XML documents. It is fully supported by the XML Processors
 allowing application developers to configure a catalog through an XML processor
 or system property or the configuration file to take advantage of the feature.
The XML Catalog API defines the following interfaces:
Catalog
-- The
Catalog
interface represents an entity
         catalog as defined by the Catalog standard. A
Catalog
object
         is immutable. Once created, it can be used to find matches in a
system
,
public
or
uri
entry.
         A custom resolver implementation may find it useful for locating local
         resources through a catalog.
CatalogFeatures
-- The
CatalogFeatures
class holds all
         of the features and properties the Catalog API supports, including
javax.xml.catalog.files
,
javax.xml.catalog.defer
,
javax.xml.catalog.prefer
, and
javax.xml.catalog.resolve
.
CatalogManager
-- The
CatalogManager
class manages the
         creation of XML catalogs and catalog resolvers.
CatalogResolver
-- The
CatalogResolver
class is a
Catalog
resolver that implements
EntityResolver
,
XMLResolver
,
LSResourceResolver
,
         and
URIResolver
, and resolves external
         references using catalogs.
Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to
 a constructor or method in any class or interface in this package will
 cause a
NullPointerException
to be thrown.
