Class JSObject
java.lang.Object
netscape.javascript.JSObject
public abstract class
JSObject
extends
Object
Allows Java code to manipulate JavaScript objects.
When a JavaScript object is passed or returned to Java code, it
 is wrapped in an instance of
JSObject
. When a
JSObject
instance is passed to the JavaScript engine,
 it is unwrapped back to its original JavaScript object. The
JSObject
class provides a way to invoke JavaScript
 methods and examine JavaScript properties.
Any data returned from the JavaScript engine to Java is
 converted to Java data types. Certain data passed to the JavaScript
 engine is converted to JavaScript data types.
