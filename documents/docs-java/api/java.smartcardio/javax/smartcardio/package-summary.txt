Java™ Smart Card I/O API.

 This specification describes the Java Smart Card I/O API defined by
JSR 268
.

 It defines a Java API for communication with Smart Cards
 using ISO/IEC 7816-4 APDUs. It thereby allows Java applications to interact with
 applications running on the Smart Card, to store and retrieve data
 on the card, etc.
The API is defined by classes in the package
javax.smartcardio
. They can be classified as follows:
Classes describing the corresponding Smart Card structures
ATR
,
CommandAPDU
,
ResponseAPDU
Factory to obtain implementations
TerminalFactory
Main classes for card and terminal functions
CardTerminals
,
CardTerminal
,
Card
,
CardChannel
Supporting permission and exception classes
CardPermission
,
CardException
,
CardNotPresentException
Service provider interface, not accessed directly by applications
TerminalFactorySpi
API Example
A simple example of using the API is:
// show the list of available terminals
      TerminalFactory factory = TerminalFactory.getDefault();
      List<CardTerminal> terminals = factory.terminals().list();
      System.out.println("Terminals: " + terminals);
      // get the first terminal
      CardTerminal terminal = terminals.get(0);
      // establish a connection with the card
      Card card = terminal.connect("T=0");
      System.out.println("card: " + card);
      CardChannel channel = card.getBasicChannel();
      ResponseAPDU r = channel.transmit(new CommandAPDU(c1));
      System.out.println("response: " + toString(r.getBytes()));
      // disconnect
      card.disconnect(false);
