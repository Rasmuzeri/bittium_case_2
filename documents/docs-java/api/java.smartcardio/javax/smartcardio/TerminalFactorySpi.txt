Class TerminalFactorySpi
java.lang.Object
javax.smartcardio.TerminalFactorySpi
public abstract class
TerminalFactorySpi
extends
Object
The TerminalFactorySpi class defines the service provider interface.
 Applications do not access this class directly, instead see
TerminalFactory
.
Service providers that want to write a new implementation should define
 a concrete subclass of TerminalFactorySpi with a constructor that takes
 an
Object
as parameter. That class needs to be registered
 in a
Provider
. The engine
type
is
TerminalFactory
.
 Service providers also need to implement subclasses of the abstract classes
CardTerminals
,
CardTerminal
,
Card
,
 and
CardChannel
.
For example:
file MyProvider.java:
package com.somedomain.card;

 import java.security.Provider;

 public class MyProvider extends Provider {
     public MyProvider() {
         super("MyProvider", 1.0d, "Smart Card Example");
         put("TerminalFactory.MyType", "com.somedomain.card.MySpi");
     }
 }
file MySpi.java
package com.somedomain.card;

 import javax.smartcardio.*;

 public class MySpi extends TerminalFactoySpi {
      public MySpi(Object parameter) {
          // initialize as appropriate
      }
      protected CardTerminals engineTerminals() {
          // add implementation code here
      }
 }

Constructor Details
TerminalFactorySpi
protected
TerminalFactorySpi
()
Constructs a new TerminalFactorySpi object.
This class is part of the service provider interface and not accessed
 directly by applications. Applications
 should use TerminalFactory objects, which can be obtained by calling
 one of the
TerminalFactory.getInstance()
methods.
Concrete subclasses should define a constructor that takes an
Object
as parameter. It will be invoked when an
 application calls one of the
TerminalFactory.getInstance()
methods and receives the
params
object specified by the application.
