Class ResponseAPDU
java.lang.Object
javax.smartcardio.ResponseAPDU
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public final class
ResponseAPDU
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
A response APDU as defined in ISO/IEC 7816-4. It consists of a conditional
 body and a two byte trailer.
 This class does not attempt to verify that the APDU encodes a semantically
 valid response.
Instances of this class are immutable. Where data is passed in or out
 via byte arrays, defensive cloning is performed.
Since:
1.6

ResponseAPDU
public
ResponseAPDU
(byte[] apdu)
Constructs a ResponseAPDU from a byte array containing the complete
 APDU contents (conditional body and trailed).
Note that the byte array is cloned to protect against subsequent
 modification.
Parameters:
apdu
- the complete response APDU
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if apdu is null
IllegalArgumentException
- if apdu.length is less than 2
Method Details
getNr
public
int
getNr
()
Returns the number of data bytes in the response body (Nr) or 0 if this
 APDU has no body. This call is equivalent to
getData().length
.
Returns:
the number of data bytes in the response body or 0 if this APDU
 has no body.
getData
public
byte[]
getData
()
Returns a copy of the data bytes in the response body. If this APDU has
 no body, this method returns a byte array with a length of zero.
Returns:
a copy of the data bytes in the response body or the empty
    byte array if this APDU has no body.
getSW1
public
int
getSW1
()
Returns the value of the status byte SW1 as a value between 0 and 255.
Returns:
the value of the status byte SW1 as a value between 0 and 255.
getSW2
public
int
getSW2
()
Returns the value of the status byte SW2 as a value between 0 and 255.
Returns:
the value of the status byte SW2 as a value between 0 and 255.
getSW
public
int
getSW
()
Returns the value of the status bytes SW1 and SW2 as a single
 status word SW.
 It is defined as
(getSW1() << 8) | getSW2()
Returns:
the value of the status word SW.
getBytes
public
byte[]
getBytes
()
Returns a copy of the bytes in this APDU.
Returns:
a copy of the bytes in this APDU.
toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns a string representation of this response APDU.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
a String representation of this response APDU.
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Compares the specified object with this response APDU for equality.
 Returns true if the given object is also a ResponseAPDU and its bytes are
 identical to the bytes in this ResponseAPDU.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- the object to be compared for equality with this response APDU
Returns:
true if the specified object is equal to this response APDU

hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Returns the hash code value for this response APDU.
Overrides:
