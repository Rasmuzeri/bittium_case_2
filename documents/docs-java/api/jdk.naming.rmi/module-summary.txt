Module jdk.naming.rmi
module
jdk.naming.rmi
Provides the implementation of the RMI Java Naming provider.
Implementation Note:
The following implementation specific system properties are supported by the
 default RMI Naming Service Provider implementation in the JDK:
jdk.jndi.object.factoriesFilter
:
The value of this system property defines a filter used by
          the JNDI runtime implementation to control the set of object factory classes which will
          be allowed to instantiate objects from object references returned by naming/directory systems.
          The factory class named by the reference instance will be matched against this filter.
          The filter property supports pattern-based filter syntax with the same format as
jdk.serialFilter
. Limit patterns
          specified in the filter property are unused.
          This property can also be specified as a
security property
.
          This property is also supported by the
default
          LDAP Naming Service Provider
.
The default value allows any object factory class specified by the reference
          instance to recreate the referenced object.
jdk.jndi.rmi.object.factoriesFilter
:
The value of this system property defines a filter used by
          the JDK RMI provider implementation to further restrict the set of object factory classes which will
          be allowed to instantiate objects from object references returned by RMI systems.
          The factory class named by the
reference instance
first will be
          matched against this specific filter and then against the global filter. The factory class is rejected
          if any of these two filters reject it, or if none of them allow it.
          The filter property supports pattern-based filter syntax with the same format as
jdk.serialFilter
. Limit patterns
          specified in the filter property are unused.
The default value allows any object factory class provided by the JDK RMI provider
          implementation.
