Interface SaslClientFactory
public interface
SaslClientFactory
An interface for creating instances of
SaslClient
.
 A class that implements this interface
 must be thread-safe and handle multiple simultaneous
 requests. It must also have a public constructor that accepts no
 argument.
This interface is not normally accessed directly by a client, which will use the
Sasl
static methods
 instead. However, a particular environment may provide and install a
 new or different
SaslClientFactory
.
Since:
1.5

throws
SaslException
Creates a SaslClient using the parameters supplied.
Parameters:
mechanisms
- The non-null list of mechanism names to try. Each is the
 IANA-registered name of a SASL mechanism. (e.g. "GSSAPI", "CRAM-MD5").
authorizationId
- The possibly null protocol-dependent
 identification to be used for authorization.
 If null or empty, the server derives an authorization
 ID from the client's authentication credentials.
 When the SASL authentication completes successfully,
 the specified entity is granted access.
protocol
- The non-null string name of the protocol for which
 the authentication is being performed (e.g., "ldap").
serverName
- The non-null fully qualified host name
 of the server to authenticate to.
props
- The possibly null set of properties used to select the SASL
 mechanism and to configure the authentication exchange of the selected
 mechanism. See the
Sasl
class for a list of standard properties.
 Other, possibly mechanism-specific, properties can be included.
 Properties not relevant to the selected mechanism are ignored,
 including any map entries with non-String keys.
cbh
- The possibly null callback handler to used by the SASL
 mechanisms to get further information from the application/library
 to complete the authentication. For example, a SASL mechanism might
 require the authentication ID, password and realm from the caller.
 The authentication ID is requested by using a
NameCallback
.
 The password is requested by using a
PasswordCallback
.
 The realm is requested by using a
RealmChoiceCallback
if there is a list
 of realms to choose from, and by using a
RealmCallback
if
 the realm must be entered.
Returns:
A possibly null
SaslClient
created using the parameters
 supplied. If null, this factory cannot produce a
SaslClient
using the parameters supplied.
Throws:
SaslException
- If cannot create a
SaslClient
because
 of an error.
getMechanismNames
String
[]
getMechanismNames
(
Map
<
String
,
?> props)
Returns an array of names of mechanisms that match the specified
 mechanism selection policies.
Parameters:
props
- The possibly null set of properties used to specify the
 security policy of the SASL mechanisms. For example, if
props
contains the
Sasl.POLICY_NOPLAINTEXT
property with the value
"true"
, then the factory must not return any SASL mechanisms
 that are susceptible to simple plain passive attacks.
 See the
Sasl
class for a complete list of policy properties.
 Non-policy related properties, if present in
props
, are ignored,
 including any map entries with non-String keys.
Returns:
A non-null array containing a IANA-registered SASL mechanism names.
