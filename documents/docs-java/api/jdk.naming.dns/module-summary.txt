Module jdk.naming.dns
module
jdk.naming.dns
Provides the implementation of the DNS Java Naming provider.
Environment Properties
The following JNDI environment properties may be used when creating
 the initial context.
com.sun.jndi.dns.timeout.initial
com.sun.jndi.dns.timeout.retries
These properties are used to alter the timeout-related defaults that the
 DNS provider uses when submitting queries. The DNS provider submits queries
 using the following exponential backoff algorithm. The provider submits a
 query to a DNS server and waits for a response to arrive within a timeout
 period (1 second by default). If it receives no response within the timeout
 period, it queries the next server, and so on. If the provider receives no
 response from any server, it doubles the timeout period and repeats the
 process of submitting the query to each server, up to a maximum number of
 retries (4 by default).
The
com.sun.jndi.dns.timeout.initial
property, if set, specifies
 the number of milliseconds to use as the initial timeout period (i.e., before
 any doubling). If this property has not been set, the default initial timeout
 is 1000 milliseconds.
The
com.sun.jndi.dns.timeout.retries
property, if set, specifies
 the number of times to retry each server using the exponential backoff
 algorithm described previously. If this property has not been set, the
 default number of retries is 4.
