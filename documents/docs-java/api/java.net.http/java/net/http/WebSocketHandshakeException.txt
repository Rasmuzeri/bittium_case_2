public
WebSocketHandshakeException
(
HttpResponse
<?> response)
Constructs a
WebSocketHandshakeException
with the given
HttpResponse
.
Parameters:
response
- the
HttpResponse
that resulted in the handshake failure
Method Details
getResponse
public
HttpResponse
<?>
getResponse
()
Returns the server's counterpart of the opening handshake.
The value may be unavailable (
null
) if this exception has
 been serialized and then deserialized.
API Note:
The primary purpose of this method is to allow programmatic
 examination of the reasons behind the failure of the opening handshake.
 Some of these reasons might allow recovery.
Returns:
server response
initCause
public
WebSocketHandshakeException
initCause
(
Throwable
cause)
Description copied from class:
Throwable
Initializes the
cause
of this throwable to the specified value.
 (The cause is the throwable that caused this throwable to get thrown.)
This method can be called at most once.  It is generally called from
 within the constructor, or immediately after creating the
 throwable.  If this throwable was created
 with
Throwable(Throwable)
or
Throwable(String,Throwable)
, this method cannot be called
 even once.
An example of using this method on a legacy throwable type
 without other support for setting the cause is:
try {
     lowLevelOp();
 } catch (LowLevelException le) {
     throw (HighLevelException)
           new HighLevelException().initCause(le); // Legacy constructor
 }
Overrides:
initCause
in class
Throwable
Parameters:
cause
- the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the
Throwable.getCause()
method).  (A
null
value is
         permitted, and indicates that the cause is nonexistent or
         unknown.)
Returns:
a reference to this
Throwable
instance.
