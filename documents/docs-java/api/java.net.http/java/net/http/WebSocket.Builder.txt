Interface WebSocket.Builder
Enclosing interface:
WebSocket
public static interface
WebSocket.Builder
A builder of
WebSocket Clients
.
Builders are created by invoking
HttpClient.newWebSocketBuilder
.
 The intermediate (setter-like) methods change the state of the builder
 and return the same builder they have been invoked on. If an intermediate
 method is not invoked, an appropriate default value (or behavior) will be
 assumed. A
Builder
is not safe for use by multiple threads
 without external synchronization.

buildAsync
(
URI
uri,
WebSocket.Listener
listener)
Builds a
WebSocket
connected to the given
URI
and
 associated with the given
Listener
.
WebSocket.Builder

(
Duration
timeout)
Sets a timeout for establishing a WebSocket connection.
WebSocket.Builder
header
(
String
name,
String
value)
Adds the given name-value pair to the list of additional HTTP headers
 sent during the opening handshake.

String
... lesserPreferred)
Sets a request for the given subprotocols.
Method Details
header
WebSocket.Builder
header
(
String
name,
String
value)
Adds the given name-value pair to the list of additional HTTP headers
 sent during the opening handshake.
Headers defined in the
WebSocket
 Protocol
are illegal. If this method is not invoked, no
 additional HTTP headers will be sent.
Parameters:
name
- the header name
value
- the header value
Returns:
this builder
connectTimeout
WebSocket.Builder
connectTimeout
(
Duration
timeout)
Sets a timeout for establishing a WebSocket connection.
If the connection is not established within the specified
 duration then building of the
WebSocket
will fail with
HttpTimeoutException
. If this method is not invoked then the
 infinite timeout is assumed.
Parameters:
timeout
- the timeout, non-
negative
,
         non-
ZERO
Returns:
this builder
subprotocols
WebSocket.Builder
subprotocols
(
String
mostPreferred,
String
... lesserPreferred)
Sets a request for the given subprotocols.
After the
WebSocket
has been built, the actual
 subprotocol can be queried through
WebSocket.getSubprotocol()
.
Subprotocols are specified in the order of preference. The most
 preferred subprotocol is specified first. If there are any additional
 subprotocols they are enumerated from the most preferred to the least
 preferred.
Subprotocols not conforming to the syntax of subprotocol
 identifiers are illegal. If this method is not invoked then no
 subprotocols will be requested.
Parameters:
mostPreferred
- the most preferred subprotocol
lesserPreferred
- the lesser preferred subprotocols
Returns:
this builder
buildAsync
CompletableFuture
<
WebSocket
>
buildAsync
(
URI
uri,
WebSocket.Listener
listener)
Builds a
WebSocket
connected to the given
URI
and
 associated with the given
Listener
.
Returns a
CompletableFuture
which will either complete
 normally with the resulting
WebSocket
or complete
 exceptionally with one of the following errors:
IOException
-
          if an I/O error occurs
WebSocketHandshakeException
-
          if the opening handshake fails
HttpTimeoutException
-
          if the opening handshake does not complete within
          the timeout
InterruptedException
-
          if the operation is interrupted
SecurityException
-
          if a security manager has been installed and it denies
access
to
uri
.
Security checks
contains more information relating to the security context
          in which the listener is invoked.
IllegalArgumentException
-
          if any of the arguments of this builder's methods are
          illegal
Parameters:
uri
- the WebSocket URI
listener
- the listener
Returns:
a
CompletableFuture
with the
WebSocket
