Interface HttpResponse.BodySubscriber<T>
Type Parameters:
T
- the response body type

A
BodySubscriber
consumes response body bytes and converts them
 into a higher-level Java type.  The class
BodySubscribers
provides implementations of many common body subscribers.
The object acts as a
Flow.Subscriber
<
List
<
ByteBuffer
>> to the HTTP Client implementation, which publishes
 lists of ByteBuffers containing the response body. The Flow of data, as
 well as the order of ByteBuffers in the Flow lists, is a strictly ordered
 representation of the response body. Both the Lists and the ByteBuffers,
 once passed to the subscriber, are no longer used by the HTTP Client. The
 subscriber converts the incoming buffers of data to some higher-level
 Java type
T
.
The
getBody()
method returns a
CompletionStage
<T>
that provides the response body
 object. The
CompletionStage
must be obtainable at any time. When
 it completes depends on the nature of type
T
. In many cases,
 when
T
represents the entire body after being consumed then
 the
CompletionStage
completes after the body has been consumed.
 If
T
is a streaming type, such as
InputStream
, then it completes before the body has been read, because
 the calling code uses the
InputStream
to consume the data.
API Note:
To ensure that all resources associated with the corresponding
 HTTP exchange are properly released, an implementation of
BodySubscriber
should ensure to
request
more data until one of
onComplete
or
onError
are signalled, or
cancel
its
subscription
if unable or unwilling to
 do so. Calling
cancel
before exhausting the response body data
 may cause the underlying HTTP connection to be closed and prevent it
 from being reused for subsequent operations.
Implementation Note:
The flow of data containing the response body is immutable.
 Specifically, it is a flow of unmodifiable lists of read-only ByteBuffers.
