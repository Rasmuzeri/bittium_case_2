Type Parameters:
T
- the push promise response body type
Enclosing interface:
HttpResponse
<
T
>
public static interface
HttpResponse.PushPromiseHandler<T>
A handler for push promises.
A
push promise
is a synthetic request sent by an HTTP/2 server
 when retrieving an initiating client-sent request. The server has
 determined, possibly through inspection of the initiating request, that
 the client will likely need the promised resource, and hence pushes a
 synthetic push request, in the form of a push promise, to the client. The
 client can choose to accept or reject the push promise request.
A push promise request may be received up to the point where the
 response body of the initiating client-sent request has been fully
 received. The delivery of a push promise response, however, is not
 coordinated with the delivery of the response to the initiating
 client-sent request.

Notification of an incoming push promise.
This method is invoked once for each push promise received, up
 to the point where the response body of the initiating client-sent
 request has been fully received.
A push promise is accepted by invoking the given
acceptor
function. The
acceptor
function must be passed a non-null
BodyHandler
, that is to be used to handle the promise's
 response body. The acceptor function will return a
CompletableFuture
that completes with the promise's response.
If the
acceptor
function is not successfully invoked,
 then the push promise is rejected. The
acceptor
function will
 throw an
IllegalStateException
if invoked more than once.
Parameters:
initiatingRequest
- the initiating client-send request
pushPromiseRequest
- the synthetic push request
acceptor
- the acceptor function that must be successfully
                 invoked to accept the push promise

<T>>> pushPromisesMap)
Returns a push promise handler that accumulates push promises, and
 their responses, into the given map.
Entries are added to the given map for each push promise accepted.
 The entry's key is the push request, and the entry's value is a
CompletableFuture
that completes with the response
 corresponding to the key's push request. A push request is rejected /
 cancelled if there is already an entry in the map whose key is
equal
to it. A push request is
 rejected / cancelled if it  does not have the same origin as its
 initiating request.
Entries are added to the given map as soon as practically
 possible when a push promise is received and accepted. That way code,
 using such a map like a cache, can determine if a push promise has
 been issued by the server and avoid making, possibly, unnecessary
 requests.
The delivery of a push promise response is not coordinated with
 the delivery of the response to the initiating client-sent request.
 However, when the response body for the initiating client-sent
 request has been fully received, the map is guaranteed to be fully
 populated, that is, no more entries will be added. The individual
CompletableFutures
contained in the map may or may not
 already be completed at this point.
Type Parameters:
T
- the push promise response body type
Parameters:
pushPromiseHandler
- t he body handler to use for push promises
pushPromisesMap
- a map to accumulate push promises into
Returns:
a push promise handler
