Interface HttpResponse<T>
Type Parameters:
T
- the response body type
public interface
HttpResponse<T>
An HTTP response.
An
HttpResponse
is not created directly, but rather returned as
 a result of sending an
HttpRequest
. An
HttpResponse
is
 made available when the response status code and headers have been received,
 and typically after the response body has also been completely received.
 Whether or not the
HttpResponse
is made available before the response
 body has been completely received depends on the
BodyHandler
provided when sending the
HttpRequest
.
This class provides methods for accessing the response status code,
 headers, the response body, and the
HttpRequest
corresponding
 to this response.
The following is an example of retrieving a response as a String:
Copy
HttpResponse<String> response = client
  .send(request, BodyHandlers.ofString());
The class
BodyHandlers
provides implementations
 of many common response handlers. Alternatively, a custom
BodyHandler
implementation can be used.
