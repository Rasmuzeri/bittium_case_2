Class HttpRequest.BodyPublishers
java.lang.Object
java.net.http.HttpRequest.BodyPublishers
Enclosing class:
HttpRequest
public static class
HttpRequest.BodyPublishers
extends
Object
Implementations of
BodyPublisher
that implement
 various useful publishers, such as publishing the request body from a
 String, or from a file.
The following are examples of using the predefined body publishers to
 convert common high-level Java objects into a flow of data suitable for
 sending as a request body:
Copy
// Request body from a String
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
     .uri(URI.create("https://foo.com/"))
     .header("Content-Type", "text/plain; charset=UTF-8")
     .POST(BodyPublishers.ofString("some body text"))
     .build();
Copy
// Request body from a File
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
     .uri(URI.create("https://foo.com/"))
     .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
     .POST(BodyPublishers.ofFile(Paths.get("file.json")))
     .build();
Copy
// Request body from a byte array
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
     .uri(URI.create("https://foo.com/"))
     .POST(BodyPublishers.ofByteArray(new byte[] { ... }))
     .build();

fromPublisher
(
Flow.Publisher
<? extends
ByteBuffer
> publisher)
Returns a request body publisher whose body is retrieved from the
 given
Flow.Publisher
. The returned request body publisher
 has an unknown content length.
API Note:
This method can be used as an adapter between
BodyPublisher
and
Flow.Publisher
, where the amount of
 request body that the publisher will publish is unknown.
Parameters:
publisher
- the publisher responsible for publishing the body
Returns:
a BodyPublisher
fromPublisher
public static
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
fromPublisher
(
Flow.Publisher
<? extends
ByteBuffer
> publisher,
 long contentLength)
Returns a request body publisher whose body is retrieved from the
 given
Flow.Publisher
. The returned request body publisher
 has the given content length.
The given
contentLength
is a positive number, that
 represents the exact amount of bytes the
publisher
must
 publish.
API Note:
This method can be used as an adapter between
BodyPublisher
and
Flow.Publisher
, where the amount of
 request body that the publisher will publish is known.
Parameters:
publisher
- the publisher responsible for publishing the body
contentLength
- a positive number representing the exact
                      amount of bytes the publisher will publish
Returns:
a BodyPublisher
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the content length is
                                  non-positive
ofString
public static
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
ofString
(
String
body)
Returns a request body publisher whose body is the given
String
, converted using the
UTF_8
character set.
Parameters:
body
- the String containing the body
Returns:
a BodyPublisher
ofString
public static
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
ofString
(
String
s,
Charset
charset)
Returns a request body publisher whose body is the given
String
, converted using the given character set.
Parameters:
s
- the String containing the body
charset
- the character set to convert the string to bytes
Returns:
a BodyPublisher
ofInputStream
public static
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
ofInputStream
(
Supplier
<? extends
InputStream
> streamSupplier)
A request body publisher that reads its data from an
InputStream
. A
Supplier
of
InputStream
is used in
 case the request needs to be repeated, as the content is not buffered.
 The
Supplier
may return
null
on subsequent attempts,
 in which case the request fails.
Parameters:
streamSupplier
- a Supplier of open InputStreams
Returns:
a BodyPublisher
ofByteArray
public static
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
ofByteArray
(byte[] buf)
Returns a request body publisher whose body is the given byte array.
Parameters:
buf
- the byte array containing the body
Returns:
a BodyPublisher
ofByteArray
public static
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
ofByteArray
(byte[] buf,
 int offset,
 int length)
Returns a request body publisher whose body is the content of the
 given byte array of
length
bytes starting from the specified
offset
.
Parameters:
buf
- the byte array containing the body
offset
- the offset of the first byte
length
- the number of bytes to use
Returns:
a BodyPublisher
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- if the sub-range is defined to be
                                   out of bounds
ofFile
public static
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
ofFile
(
Path
path)
throws
FileNotFoundException
A request body publisher that takes data from the contents of a File.
Security manager permission checks are performed in this factory
 method, when the
BodyPublisher
is created. Care must be taken
 that the
BodyPublisher
is not shared with untrusted code.
Parameters:
path
- the path to the file containing the body
Returns:
a BodyPublisher
Throws:
FileNotFoundException
- if the path is not found
SecurityException
- if
opening the file for reading
is denied:
         in the case of the system-default file system provider,
         and a security manager is installed,
checkRead
is invoked to check read access to the given file
ofByteArrays
public static
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
ofByteArrays
(
Iterable
<byte[]> iter)
A request body publisher that takes data from an
Iterable
of byte arrays. An
Iterable
is provided which supplies
Iterator
instances. Each attempt to send the request results
 in one invocation of the
Iterable
.
Parameters:
iter
- an Iterable of byte arrays
Returns:
a BodyPublisher
noBody
public static
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
noBody
()
A request body publisher which sends no request body.
Returns:
a BodyPublisher which completes immediately and sends
         no request body.
concat
public static
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
concat
(
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
... publishers)
Returns a
BodyPublisher
that publishes a request
 body consisting of the concatenation of the request bodies
 published by a sequence of publishers.
If the sequence is empty an
empty
publisher
 is returned. Otherwise, if the sequence contains a single element,
 that publisher is returned. Otherwise a
concatenation publisher
is returned.
The request body published by a
concatenation publisher
is logically equivalent to the request body that would have
 been published by concatenating all the bytes of each publisher
 in sequence.
Each publisher is lazily subscribed to in turn,
 until all the body bytes are published, an error occurs, or the
 concatenation publisher's subscription is cancelled.
 The concatenation publisher may be subscribed to more than once,
 which in turn may result in the publishers in the sequence being
 subscribed to more than once.
The concatenation publisher has a known content
 length only if all publishers in the sequence have a known content
 length. The
contentLength
reported by the concatenation publisher is computed as follows:
If any of the publishers reports an
unknown
content length,
         or if the sum of the known content lengths would exceed
Long.MAX_VALUE
, the resulting
         content length is
unknown
.
Otherwise, the resulting content length is the sum of the
         known content lengths, a number between
0
and
Long.MAX_VALUE
, inclusive.
Implementation Note:
If the concatenation publisher's subscription is
cancelled
, or an error occurs
 while publishing the bytes, not all publishers in the sequence may
 be subscribed to.
Parameters:
publishers
- a sequence of publishers.
Returns:
An aggregate publisher that publishes a request body
 logically equivalent to the concatenation of all bytes published
 by each publisher in the sequence.
