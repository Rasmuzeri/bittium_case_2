Defines the automatic redirection policy.
The automatic redirection policy is checked whenever a
3XX
response code is received. If redirection does not happen automatically,
 then the response, containing the
3XX
response code, is returned,
 where it can be handled manually.
Redirect
policy is set through the
Builder.followRedirects
method.
Implementation Note:
When automatic redirection occurs, the request method of the
 redirected request may be modified depending on the specific
30X
status code, as specified in
RFC 7231
. In addition, the
301
and
302
status codes
 cause a
POST
request to be converted to a
GET
in the
 redirected request.
