Interface HttpRequest.Builder
Enclosing class:
HttpRequest
public static interface
HttpRequest.Builder
A builder of
HTTP requests
.
Instances of
HttpRequest.Builder
are created by calling
HttpRequest.newBuilder()
,
HttpRequest.newBuilder(URI)
,
 or
HttpRequest.newBuilder(HttpRequest, BiPredicate)
.
The builder can be used to configure per-request state, such as: the
 request URI, the request method (default is GET unless explicitly set),
 specific request headers, etc. Each of the setter methods modifies the
 state of the builder and returns the same instance. The methods are not
 synchronized and should not be called from multiple threads without
 external synchronization. The
build
method returns a new
HttpRequest
each time it is invoked. Once built an
HttpRequest
is immutable, and can be sent multiple times.
Note, that not all request headers may be set by user code. Some are
 restricted for security reasons and others such as the headers relating
 to authentication, redirection and cookie management may be managed by
 specific APIs rather than through directly user set headers.

Method Details
uri
HttpRequest.Builder
uri
(
URI
uri)
Sets this
HttpRequest
's request
URI
.
Parameters:
uri
- the request URI
Returns:
this builder
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the
URI
scheme is not
         supported
expectContinue
HttpRequest.Builder
expectContinue
(boolean enable)
Requests the server to acknowledge the request before sending the
 body. This is disabled by default. If enabled, the server is
 requested to send an error response or a
100 Continue
response before the client sends the request body. This means the
 request publisher for the request will not be invoked until this
 interim response is received.
Parameters:
enable
-
true
if Expect continue to be sent
Returns:
this builder
version
HttpRequest.Builder
version
(
HttpClient.Version
version)
Sets the preferred
HttpClient.Version
for this request.
The corresponding
HttpResponse
should be checked for the
 version that was actually used. If the version is not set in a
 request, then the version requested will be that of the sending
HttpClient
.
Parameters:
version
- the HTTP protocol version requested
Returns:
this builder
header
HttpRequest.Builder
header
(
String
name,
String
value)
Adds the given name value pair to the set of headers for this request.
 The given value is added to the list of values for that name.
Implementation Note:
An implementation may choose to restrict some header names
           or values, as the HTTP Client may determine their value itself.
           For example, "Content-Length", which will be determined by
           the request Publisher. In such a case, an implementation of
HttpRequest.Builder
may choose to throw an
IllegalArgumentException
if such a header is passed
           to the builder.
Parameters:
name
- the header name
value
- the header value
Returns:
this builder
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the header name or value is not
         valid, see
RFC 7230 section-3.2
, or the header name or value is restricted
         by the implementation.
headers
HttpRequest.Builder
headers
(
String
... headers)
Adds the given name value pairs to the set of headers for this
 request. The supplied
String
instances must alternate as
 header names and header values.
 To add several values to the same name then the same name must
 be supplied with each new value.
Parameters:
headers
- the list of name value pairs
Returns:
this builder
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if there are an odd number of
         parameters, or if a header name or value is not valid, see
RFC 7230 section-3.2
, or a header name or value is
restricted
by the
         implementation.
timeout
HttpRequest.Builder
timeout
(
Duration
duration)
Sets a timeout for this request. If the response is not received
 within the specified timeout then an
HttpTimeoutException
is
 thrown from
HttpClient::send
or
HttpClient::sendAsync
completes exceptionally with an
HttpTimeoutException
. The effect
 of not setting a timeout is the same as setting an infinite Duration,
 i.e. block forever.
Parameters:
duration
- the timeout duration
Returns:
this builder
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the duration is non-positive
setHeader
HttpRequest.Builder
setHeader
(
String
name,
String
value)
Sets the given name value pair to the set of headers for this
 request. This overwrites any previously set values for name.
Parameters:
name
- the header name
value
- the header value
Returns:
this builder
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the header name or value is not valid,
         see
RFC 7230 section-3.2
, or the header name or value is
restricted
by the
         implementation.
GET
HttpRequest.Builder
GET
()
Sets the request method of this builder to GET.
 This is the default.
Returns:
this builder
POST
HttpRequest.Builder
POST
(
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
bodyPublisher)
Sets the request method of this builder to POST and sets its
 request body publisher to the given value.
Parameters:
bodyPublisher
- the body publisher
Returns:
this builder
PUT
HttpRequest.Builder
PUT
(
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
bodyPublisher)
Sets the request method of this builder to PUT and sets its
 request body publisher to the given value.
Parameters:
bodyPublisher
- the body publisher
Returns:
this builder

DELETE
()
Sets the request method of this builder to DELETE.
Returns:
this builder
HEAD
default
HttpRequest.Builder
HEAD
()
Sets the request method of this builder to HEAD.
Implementation Requirements:
The default implementation is expected to have the same behaviour as:
return method("HEAD", BodyPublishers.noBody());
Returns:
this builder
Since:
18
method
HttpRequest.Builder
method
(
String
method,
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
bodyPublisher)
Sets the request method and request body of this builder to the
 given values.
API Note:
The
noBody
request
 body publisher can be used where no request body is required or
 appropriate. Whether a method is restricted, or not, is
 implementation specific. For example, some implementations may choose
 to restrict the
CONNECT
method.
Parameters:
method
- the method to use
bodyPublisher
- the body publisher
Returns:
this builder
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the method name is not
         valid, see
RFC 7230 section-3.1.1
, or the method is restricted by the
         implementation.
build
HttpRequest
build
()
Builds and returns an
HttpRequest
.
Implementation Requirements:
This method returns a new
HttpRequest
each time it is
 invoked. Once built, the
HttpRequest
is immutable and can be
 sent multiple times.
Returns:
a new
HttpRequest
Throws:
IllegalStateException
- if a URI has not been set
copy
HttpRequest.Builder
copy
()
Returns an exact duplicate copy of this
Builder
based on
 current state. The new builder can then be modified independently of
 this builder.
Returns:
an exact copy of this builder
