Interface HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
All Superinterfaces:
Flow.Publisher
<

Enclosing class:
HttpRequest
public static interface
HttpRequest.BodyPublisher
extends
Flow.Publisher
<
ByteBuffer
>
A
BodyPublisher
converts high-level Java objects into a flow of
 byte buffers suitable for sending as a request body.  The class
BodyPublishers
provides implementations of many
 common publishers.
The
BodyPublisher
interface extends
Flow.Publisher<ByteBuffer>
, which means that a
BodyPublisher
acts as a publisher of
byte buffers
.
When sending a request that contains a body, the HTTP Client
 subscribes to the request's
BodyPublisher
in order to receive the
 flow of outgoing request body data. The normal semantics of
Flow.Subscriber
and
Flow.Publisher
are implemented by the HTTP
 Client and are expected from
BodyPublisher
implementations. Each
 outgoing request results in one HTTP Client
Subscriber
subscribing to the
BodyPublisher
in order to provide the sequence
 of byte buffers containing the request body. Instances of
ByteBuffer
published by the publisher must be allocated by the
 publisher, and must not be accessed after being published to the HTTP
 Client. These subscriptions complete normally when the request body is
 fully sent, and can be canceled or terminated early through error. If a
 request needs to be resent for any reason, then a new subscription is
 created which is expected to generate the same data as before.
A
BodyPublisher
that reports a
content length
of
0
may not be subscribed to by the HTTP Client,
 as it has effectively no data to publish.

contentLength
long
contentLength
()
Returns the content length for this request body. May be zero
 if no request body being sent, greater than zero for a fixed
 length content, or less than zero for an unknown content length.
This method may be invoked before the publisher is subscribed to.
 This method may be invoked more than once by the HTTP client
 implementation, and MUST return the same constant value each time.
Returns:
the content length for this request body, if known
