s)
Sets the MBean server on which the query is to be performed.
 The setting is valid for the thread performing the set.
 It is copied to any threads created by that thread at the moment
 of their creation.
For historical reasons, this method is not static, but its
 behavior does not depend on the instance on which it is
 called.
Parameters:
s
- The MBean server on which the query is to be performed.

getMBeanServer
()
Return the MBean server that was most recently given to the
setMBeanServer
method by this thread.
 If this thread never called that method, the result is the
 value its parent thread would have obtained from
getMBeanServer
at the moment of the creation of
 this thread, or null if there is no parent thread.
Returns:
the MBean server.
