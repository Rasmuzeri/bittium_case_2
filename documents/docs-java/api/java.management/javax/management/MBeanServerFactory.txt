Class MBeanServerFactory
java.lang.Object
javax.management.MBeanServerFactory
public class
MBeanServerFactory
extends
Object
Provides MBean server references.  There are no instances of
 this class.
Since JMX 1.2 this class makes it possible to replace the default
 MBeanServer implementation. This is done using the
MBeanServerBuilder
class.
 The class of the initial MBeanServerBuilder to be
 instantiated can be specified through the
javax.management.builder.initial
system property.
 The specified class must be a public subclass of
MBeanServerBuilder
, and must have a public
 empty constructor.
By default, if no value for that property is specified, an instance of
javax.management.MBeanServerBuilder
is created. Otherwise, the MBeanServerFactory attempts to load the
 specified class using
Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()
, or if that is null,
Class.forName()
. Then
 it creates an initial instance of that Class using
Class.newInstance()
. If any checked exception
 is raised during this process (e.g.
ClassNotFoundException
,
InstantiationException
) the MBeanServerFactory
 will propagate this exception from within a RuntimeException.
The
javax.management.builder.initial
system property is
 consulted every time a new MBeanServer needs to be created, and the
 class pointed to by that property is loaded. If that class is different
 from that of the current MBeanServerBuilder, then a new MBeanServerBuilder
 is created. Otherwise, the MBeanServerFactory may create a new
 MBeanServerBuilder or reuse the current one.
If the class pointed to by the property cannot be
 loaded, or does not correspond to a valid subclass of MBeanServerBuilder
 then an exception is propagated, and no MBeanServer can be created until
 the
javax.management.builder.initial
system property is reset to
 valid value.
The MBeanServerBuilder makes it possible to wrap the MBeanServers
 returned by the default MBeanServerBuilder implementation, for the purpose
 of e.g. adding an additional security layer.

Method Details
releaseMBeanServer
public static
void
releaseMBeanServer
(
MBeanServer
mbeanServer)
Remove internal MBeanServerFactory references to a created
 MBeanServer. This allows the garbage collector to remove the
 MBeanServer object.
Parameters:
mbeanServer
- the MBeanServer object to remove.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
mbeanServer
was not generated by one of the
createMBeanServer
methods, or if
releaseMBeanServer
was already called on it.
SecurityException
- if there is a SecurityManager and
 the caller's permissions do not include or imply
MBeanServerPermission
("releaseMBeanServer")
.
createMBeanServer
public static
MBeanServer
createMBeanServer
()
Return a new object implementing the MBeanServer interface
 with a standard default domain name.  The default domain name
 is used as the domain part in the ObjectName of MBeans when the
 domain is specified by the user is null.
The standard default domain name is
DefaultDomain
.
The MBeanServer reference is internally kept. This will
 allow
findMBeanServer
to return a reference to
 this MBeanServer object.
This method is equivalent to
createMBeanServer(null)
.
Returns:
the newly created MBeanServer.
Throws:
SecurityException
- if there is a SecurityManager and the
 caller's permissions do not include or imply
MBeanServerPermission
("createMBeanServer")
.
JMRuntimeException
- if the property
javax.management.builder.initial
exists but the
 class it names cannot be instantiated through a public
 no-argument constructor; or if the instantiated builder returns
 null from its
newMBeanServerDelegate
or
newMBeanServer
methods.
ClassCastException
- if the property
javax.management.builder.initial
exists and can be
 instantiated but is not assignment compatible with
MBeanServerBuilder
.
createMBeanServer
public static
MBeanServer
createMBeanServer
(
String
domain)
Return a new object implementing the
MBeanServer
interface with the specified default domain name.  The given
 domain name is used as the domain part in the ObjectName of
 MBeans when the domain is specified by the user is null.
The MBeanServer reference is internally kept. This will
 allow
findMBeanServer
to return a reference to
 this MBeanServer object.
Parameters:
domain
- the default domain name for the created
 MBeanServer.  This is the value that will be returned by
MBeanServer.getDefaultDomain()
.
Returns:
the newly created MBeanServer.
Throws:
SecurityException
- if there is a SecurityManager and
 the caller's permissions do not include or imply
MBeanServerPermission
("createMBeanServer")
.
JMRuntimeException
- if the property
javax.management.builder.initial
exists but the
 class it names cannot be instantiated through a public
 no-argument constructor; or if the instantiated builder returns
 null from its
newMBeanServerDelegate
or
newMBeanServer
methods.
ClassCastException
- if the property
javax.management.builder.initial
exists and can be
 instantiated but is not assignment compatible with
MBeanServerBuilder
.
newMBeanServer
public static
MBeanServer
newMBeanServer
()
Return a new object implementing the MBeanServer interface
 with a standard default domain name, without keeping an
 internal reference to this new object.  The default domain name
 is used as the domain part in the ObjectName of MBeans when the
 domain is specified by the user is null.
The standard default domain name is
DefaultDomain
.
No reference is kept.
findMBeanServer
will not
 be able to return a reference to this MBeanServer object, but
 the garbage collector will be able to remove the MBeanServer
 object when it is no longer referenced.
This method is equivalent to
newMBeanServer(null)
.
Returns:
the newly created MBeanServer.
Throws:
SecurityException
- if there is a SecurityManager and the
 caller's permissions do not include or imply
MBeanServerPermission
("newMBeanServer")
.
JMRuntimeException
- if the property
javax.management.builder.initial
exists but the
 class it names cannot be instantiated through a public
 no-argument constructor; or if the instantiated builder returns
 null from its
newMBeanServerDelegate
or
newMBeanServer
methods.

newMBeanServer
public static
MBeanServer
newMBeanServer
(
String
domain)
Return a new object implementing the MBeanServer interface
 with the specified default domain name, without keeping an
 internal reference to this new object.  The given domain name
 is used as the domain part in the ObjectName of MBeans when the
 domain is specified by the user is null.
No reference is kept.
findMBeanServer
will not
 be able to return a reference to this MBeanServer object, but
 the garbage collector will be able to remove the MBeanServer
 object when it is no longer referenced.
Parameters:
domain
- the default domain name for the created
 MBeanServer.  This is the value that will be returned by
MBeanServer.getDefaultDomain()
.
Returns:
the newly created MBeanServer.
Throws:
SecurityException
- if there is a SecurityManager and the
 caller's permissions do not include or imply
MBeanServerPermission
("newMBeanServer")
.
JMRuntimeException
- if the property
javax.management.builder.initial
exists but the
 class it names cannot be instantiated through a public
 no-argument constructor; or if the instantiated builder returns
 null from its
newMBeanServerDelegate
or
newMBeanServer
methods.
ClassCastException

findMBeanServer
public static
ArrayList
<
MBeanServer
>
findMBeanServer
(
String
agentId)
Return a list of registered MBeanServer objects.  A
 registered MBeanServer object is one that was created by one of
 the
createMBeanServer
methods and not subsequently
 released with
releaseMBeanServer
.
Parameters:
agentId
- The agent identifier of the MBeanServer to
 retrieve.  If this parameter is null, all registered
 MBeanServers in this JVM are returned.  Otherwise, only
 MBeanServers whose id is equal to
agentId
are
 returned.  The id of an MBeanServer is the
MBeanServerId
attribute of its delegate MBean.
Returns:
A list of MBeanServer objects.
Throws:
SecurityException
- if there is a SecurityManager and the
 caller's permissions do not include or imply
MBeanServerPermission
("findMBeanServer")

getClassLoaderRepository
(
MBeanServer
server)
Return the ClassLoaderRepository used by the given MBeanServer.
 This method is equivalent to
server.getClassLoaderRepository()
.
Parameters:
server
- The MBeanServer under examination. Since JMX 1.2,
 if
server
is
null
, the result is a
NullPointerException
.  This behavior differs from what
 was implemented in JMX 1.1 - where the possibility to use
null
was deprecated.
Returns:
The Class Loader Repository used by the given MBeanServer.
Throws:
SecurityException
- if there is a SecurityManager and
 the caller's permissions do not include or imply
MBeanPermission
("getClassLoaderRepository")
.
NullPointerException
- if
server
is null.
