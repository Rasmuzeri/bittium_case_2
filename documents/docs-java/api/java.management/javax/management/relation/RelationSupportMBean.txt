Interface RelationSupportMBean
All Superinterfaces:
Relation
All Known Implementing Classes:
RelationSupport
public interface
RelationSupportMBean
extends
Relation
A RelationSupport object is used internally by the Relation Service to
 represent simple relations (only roles, no properties or methods), with an
 unlimited number of roles, of any relation type. As internal representation,
 it is not exposed to the user.
RelationSupport class conforms to the design patterns of standard MBean. So
 the user can decide to instantiate a RelationSupport object himself as
 a MBean (as it follows the MBean design patterns), to register it in the
 MBean Server, and then to add it in the Relation Service.
The user can also, when creating his own MBean relation class, have it
 extending RelationSupport, to retrieve the implementations of required
 interfaces (see below).
It is also possible to have in a user relation MBean class a member
 being a RelationSupport object, and to implement the required interfaces by
 delegating all to this member.
RelationSupport implements the Relation interface (to be handled by the
 Relation Service).

Method Details
isInRelationService
Boolean
isInRelationService
()
Returns an internal flag specifying if the object is still handled by
 the Relation Service.
Returns:
a Boolean equal to
Boolean.TRUE
if the object
 is still handled by the Relation Service and
Boolean.FALSE
otherwise.

void
setRelationServiceManagementFlag
(
Boolean
flag)
throws
IllegalArgumentException
Specifies whether this relation is handled by the Relation
 Service.
BEWARE, this method has to be exposed as the Relation Service will
 access the relation through its management interface. It is RECOMMENDED
 NOT to use this method. Using it does not affect the registration of the
 relation object in the Relation Service, but will provide wrong
 information about it!
Parameters:
flag
- whether the relation is handled by the Relation Service.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if null parameter
