A RoleList represents a list of roles (Role objects). It is used as
 parameter when creating a relation, and when trying to set several roles in
 a relation (via 'setRoles()' method). It is returned as part of a
 RoleResult, to provide roles successfully retrieved.

Constructor Details
RoleList
public
RoleList
()
Constructs an empty RoleList.
RoleList
public
RoleList
(int initialCapacity)
Constructs an empty RoleList with the initial capacity
 specified.
Parameters:
initialCapacity
- initial capacity
RoleList
public
RoleList
(
List
<
Role
> list)
throws
IllegalArgumentException
Constructs a
RoleList
containing the elements of the
List
specified, in the order in which they are returned by
 the
List
's iterator. The
RoleList
instance has
 an initial capacity of 110% of the size of the
List
specified.
Parameters:
list
- the
List
that defines the initial contents of
 the new
RoleList
.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the
list
parameter
 is
null
or if the
list
parameter contains any
 non-Role objects.

Method Details
asList
public
List
<
Role
>
asList
()
Return a view of this list as a
List<Role>
.
 Changes to the returned value are reflected by changes
 to the original
RoleList
and vice versa.
Returns:
a
List<Role>
whose contents
 reflect the contents of this
RoleList
.
If this method has ever been called on a given
RoleList
instance, a subsequent attempt to add
 an object to that instance which is not a
Role
will fail with an
IllegalArgumentException
. For compatibility
 reasons, a
RoleList
on which this method has never
 been called does allow objects other than
Role
s to
 be added.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if this
RoleList
contains
 an element that is not a
Role
.
Since:
1.6
add
public
void
add
(
Role
role)
throws

 Elements with an index greater than or equal to the current position are
 shifted up.
Parameters:

- The position in the list where the new Role
 object is to be inserted.
role
- The Role object to be inserted.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the role is null.

 outside of the list.

- if the role is null.
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- if accessing with an index
 outside of the list.

Returns:
true if this list changed as a result of the call.
Throws:
