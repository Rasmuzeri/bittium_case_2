package
javax.management.timer
Provides the definition of the Timer MBean.  A Timer MBean
      maintains a list of scheduled notifications and, because it is a
NotificationBroadcaster
, a list of listeners for those
      notifications.  Whenever the time for one of the scheduled
      notifications is reached, each listener receives the
      notification.  Notifications can be repeated at a fixed
      interval, and the number of repetitions can be bounded.
A listener for a Timer MBean can itself be an MBean, using
      the method
MBeanServer.addNotificationListener(ObjectName, ObjectName, NotificationFilter, Object)
.  In this way, a
      management application can create an MBean representing a task,
      then schedule that task using a Timer MBean.
