Interface ModelMBean
All Superinterfaces:

All Known Implementing Classes:

public interface
ModelMBean
extends
DynamicMBean
,
PersistentMBean
,
ModelMBeanNotificationBroadcaster
This interface must be implemented by the ModelMBeans. An implementation of this interface
 must be shipped with every JMX Agent.
Java resources wishing to be manageable instantiate the ModelMBean using the MBeanServer's
 createMBean method.  The resource then sets the ModelMBeanInfo (with Descriptors) for the ModelMBean
 instance. The attributes and operations exposed via the ModelMBeanInfo for the ModelMBean are accessible
 from MBeans, connectors/adaptors like other MBeans. Through the ModelMBeanInfo Descriptors, values and methods in
 the managed application can be defined and mapped to attributes and operations of the ModelMBean.
 This mapping can be defined during development in an XML formatted file or dynamically and
 programmatically at runtime.
Every ModelMBean which is instantiated in the MBeanServer becomes manageable:
 its attributes and operations
 become remotely accessible through the connectors/adaptors connected to that MBeanServer.
 A Java object cannot be registered in the MBeanServer unless it is a JMX compliant MBean.
 By instantiating a ModelMBean, resources are guaranteed that the MBean is valid.
MBeanException and RuntimeOperationsException must be thrown on every public method.  This allows
 for wrapping exceptions from distributed communications (RMI, EJB, etc.).  These exceptions do
 not have to be thrown by the implementation except in the scenarios described in the specification
 and javadoc.

Method Details
setModelMBeanInfo
void
setModelMBeanInfo
(
ModelMBeanInfo
inModelMBeanInfo)
throws
MBeanException
,
RuntimeOperationsException
Initializes a ModelMBean object using ModelMBeanInfo passed in.
 This method makes it possible to set a customized ModelMBeanInfo on
 the ModelMBean as long as it is not registered with the MBeanServer.
Once the ModelMBean's ModelMBeanInfo (with Descriptors) are
 customized and set on the ModelMBean, the  ModelMBean can be
 registered with the MBeanServer.
If the ModelMBean is currently registered, this method throws
 a
RuntimeOperationsException
wrapping an
IllegalStateException
Parameters:
inModelMBeanInfo
- The ModelMBeanInfo object to be used
        by the ModelMBean.
Throws:
MBeanException
- Wraps a distributed communication
        Exception.
RuntimeOperationsException
-
Wraps an
IllegalArgumentException
if
         the MBeanInfo passed in parameter is null.
Wraps an
IllegalStateException
if the ModelMBean
         is currently registered in the MBeanServer.
setManagedResource
void
setManagedResource
(
Object
mr,
String
mr_type)
throws
MBeanException
,
RuntimeOperationsException
,
InstanceNotFoundException
,
InvalidTargetObjectTypeException
Sets the instance handle of the object against which to
 execute all methods in this ModelMBean management interface
 (MBeanInfo and Descriptors).
Parameters:
mr
- Object that is the managed resource
mr_type
- The type of reference for the managed resource.  Can be: ObjectReference,
               Handle, IOR, EJBHandle, RMIReference.
               If the MBeanServer cannot process the mr_type passed in, an InvalidTargetTypeException
               will be thrown.
Throws:
MBeanException
- The initializer of the object has thrown an exception.
RuntimeOperationsException
- Wraps an IllegalArgumentException:
       The managed resource type passed in parameter is null.
InstanceNotFoundException
- The managed resource object could not be found
InvalidTargetObjectTypeException
- The managed resource type cannot be processed by the
 ModelMBean or JMX Agent.
