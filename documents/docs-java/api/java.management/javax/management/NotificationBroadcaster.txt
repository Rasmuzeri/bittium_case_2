NotificationBroadcaster
Interface implemented by an MBean that emits Notifications. It
 allows a listener to be registered with the MBean as a notification
 listener.
Notification dispatch
When an MBean emits a notification, it considers each listener that has been
 added with
addNotificationListener
and not
 subsequently removed with
removeNotificationListener
.
 If a filter was provided with that listener, and if the filter's
isNotificationEnabled
method returns
 false, the listener is ignored.  Otherwise, the listener's
handleNotification
method is called with
 the notification, as well as the handback object that was provided to
addNotificationListener
.
If the same listener is added more than once, it is considered as many times as it was
 added.  It is often useful to add the same listener with different filters or handback
 objects.
Implementations of this interface can differ regarding the thread in which the methods
 of filters and listeners are called.
If the method call of a filter or listener throws an
Exception
, then that
 exception should not prevent other listeners from being invoked.  However, if the method
 call throws an
Error
, then it is recommended that processing of the notification
 stop at that point, and if it is possible to propagate the
Error
to the sender of
 the notification, this should be done.
New code should use the
NotificationEmitter
interface
 instead.
Implementations of this interface and of
NotificationEmitter
should be careful about synchronization.  In particular, it is not a good
 idea for an implementation to hold any locks while it is calling a
 listener.  To deal with the possibility that the list of listeners might
 change while a notification is being dispatched, a good strategy is to
 use a
CopyOnWriteArrayList
for this list.

throws
IllegalArgumentException
Adds a listener to this MBean.
Parameters:
listener
- The listener object which will handle the
 notifications emitted by the broadcaster.
filter
- The filter object. If filter is null, no
 filtering will be performed before handling notifications.
handback
- An opaque object to be sent back to the
 listener when a notification is emitted. This object cannot be
 used by the Notification broadcaster object. It should be
 resent unchanged with the notification to the listener.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- Listener parameter is null.

void
removeNotificationListener
(
NotificationListener
listener)
throws
ListenerNotFoundException
Removes a listener from this MBean.  If the listener
 has been registered with different handback objects or
 notification filters, all entries corresponding to the listener
 will be removed.
Parameters:
listener
- A listener that was previously added to this
 MBean.
Throws:
ListenerNotFoundException
- The listener is not
 registered with the MBean.

getNotificationInfo
MBeanNotificationInfo
[]
getNotificationInfo
()
Returns an array indicating, for each notification this
 MBean may send, the name of the Java class of the notification
 and the notification type.
It is not illegal for the MBean to send notifications not
 described in this array.  However, some clients of the MBean
 server may depend on the array being complete for their correct
 functioning.
Returns:
the array of possible notifications.
