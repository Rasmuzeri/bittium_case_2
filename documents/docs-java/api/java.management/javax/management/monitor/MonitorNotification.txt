All Implemented Interfaces:

public class
MonitorNotification
extends
Notification
Provides definitions of the notifications sent by monitor MBeans.
The notification source and a set of parameters concerning the monitor MBean's state
 need to be specified when creating a new object of this class.

 The list of notifications fired by the monitor MBeans is the following:
Common to all kind of monitors:
The observed object is not registered in the MBean server.
The observed attribute is not contained in the observed object.
The type of the observed attribute is not correct.
Any exception (except the cases described above) occurs when trying to get the value of the observed attribute.
Common to the counter and the gauge monitors:
The threshold high or threshold low are not of the same type as the gauge (gauge monitors).
The threshold or the offset or the modulus are not of the same type as the counter (counter monitors).
Counter monitors only:
The observed attribute has reached the threshold value.
Gauge monitors only:
The observed attribute has exceeded the threshold high value.
The observed attribute has exceeded the threshold low value.
String monitors only:
The observed attribute has matched the "string to compare" value.
The observed attribute has differed from the "string to compare" value.
