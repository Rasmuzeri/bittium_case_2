Represents a list of values for attributes of an MBean.  See the
getAttributes
and
setAttributes
methods of
MBeanServer
and
MBeanServerConnection
.
For compatibility reasons, it is possible, though
 highly discouraged, to add objects to an
AttributeList
that are
 not instances of
Attribute
.  However, an
AttributeList
can be made
type-safe
, which means that an attempt to add
 an object that is not an
Attribute
will produce an
IllegalArgumentException
.  An
AttributeList
becomes type-safe
 when the method
asList()
is called on it.

Constructor Details
AttributeList
public
AttributeList
()
Constructs an empty
AttributeList
.
AttributeList
public
AttributeList
(int initialCapacity)
Constructs an empty
AttributeList
with
 the initial capacity specified.
Parameters:
initialCapacity
- the initial capacity of the
AttributeList
, as specified by
ArrayList(int)
.
AttributeList
public
AttributeList
(
AttributeList
list)
Constructs an
AttributeList
containing the
 elements of the
AttributeList
specified, in the
 order in which they are returned by the
AttributeList
's iterator.  The
AttributeList
instance has an initial capacity of
 110% of the size of the
AttributeList
specified.
Parameters:
list
- the
AttributeList
that defines the initial
 contents of the new
AttributeList
.
See Also:
ArrayList(java.util.Collection)
AttributeList
public
AttributeList
(
List
<
Attribute
> list)
Constructs an
AttributeList
containing the elements of the
List
specified, in the order in which they are returned by
 the
List
's iterator.
Parameters:
list
- the
List
that defines the initial contents of
 the new
AttributeList
.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the
list
parameter
 is
null
or if the
list
parameter contains any
 non-Attribute objects.
Since:
1.6

ArrayList(java.util.Collection)
Method Details
asList
public
List
<
Attribute
>
asList
()
Return a view of this list as a
List<Attribute>
.
 Changes to the returned value are reflected by changes
 to the original
AttributeList
and vice versa.
Returns:
a
List<Attribute>
whose contents
 reflect the contents of this
AttributeList
.
If this method has ever been called on a given
AttributeList
instance, a subsequent attempt to add
 an object to that instance which is not an
Attribute
will fail with an
IllegalArgumentException
. For compatibility
 reasons, an
AttributeList
on which this method has never
 been called does allow objects other than
Attribute
s to
 be added.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if this
AttributeList
contains
 an element that is not an
Attribute
.
Since:
1.6

Attribute
specified as the last element of the list.
Parameters:
object
- The attribute to be added.
add
public
void
add
(int index,
Attribute
object)
Inserts the attribute specified as an element at the position specified.
 Elements with an index greater than or equal to the current position are
 shifted up. If the index is out of range (index < 0 || index >
 size()) a RuntimeOperationsException should be raised, wrapping the
 java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException thrown.
Parameters:

- The position in the list where the new
Attribute
object is to be inserted.

- The
Attribute
object to be inserted.
set

(int index,
Attribute
object)
Sets the element at the position specified to be the attribute specified.
 The previous element at that position is discarded. If the index is
 out of range (index < 0 || index > size()) a RuntimeOperationsException
 should be raised, wrapping the java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException thrown.
Parameters:
index
- The position specified.
object
- The value to which the attribute element should be set.
addAll
public
boolean
addAll
(
AttributeList
list)
Appends all the elements in the
AttributeList
specified to
 the end of the list, in the order in which they are returned by the
 Iterator of the
AttributeList
specified.
Parameters:

AttributeList
specified
 into this list, starting at the specified position, in the order in which
 they are returned by the Iterator of the
AttributeList
specified.
 If the index is out of range (index < 0 || index > size()) a
 RuntimeOperationsException should be raised, wrapping the
 java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException thrown.
Parameters:
index
- Position at which to insert the first element from the
AttributeList
specified.
