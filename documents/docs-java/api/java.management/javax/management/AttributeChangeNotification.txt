Class AttributeChangeNotification
java.lang.Object
java.util.EventObject
javax.management.Notification
javax.management.AttributeChangeNotification
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
AttributeChangeNotification
extends
Notification
Provides definitions of the attribute change notifications sent by MBeans.
It's up to the MBean owning the attribute of interest to create and send
 attribute change notifications when the attribute change occurs.
 So the
NotificationBroadcaster
interface has to be implemented
 by any MBean for which an attribute change is of interest.
Example:
 If an MBean called
myMbean
needs to notify registered listeners
 when its attribute:
String myString
is modified,
myMbean
creates and emits the following notification:
new AttributeChangeNotification(myMbean, sequenceNumber, timeStamp, msg,
                                 "myString", "String", oldValue, newValue);
Since:
1.5
