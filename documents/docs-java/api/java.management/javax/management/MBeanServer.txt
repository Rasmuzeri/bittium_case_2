Interface MBeanServer
All Superinterfaces:
MBeanServerConnection
All Known Subinterfaces:
MBeanServerForwarder
public interface
MBeanServer
extends
MBeanServerConnection
This is the interface for MBean manipulation on the agent
 side. It contains the methods necessary for the creation,
 registration, and deletion of MBeans as well as the access methods
 for registered MBeans.  This is the core component of the JMX
 infrastructure.
User code does not usually implement this interface.  Instead,
 an object that implements this interface is obtained with one of
 the methods in the
MBeanServerFactory
class.
Every MBean which is added to the MBean server becomes
 manageable: its attributes and operations become remotely
 accessible through the connectors/adaptors connected to that MBean
 server.  A Java object cannot be registered in the MBean server
 unless it is a JMX compliant MBean.
When an MBean is registered or unregistered in the
 MBean server a
MBeanServerNotification
Notification is emitted. To register an
 object as listener to MBeanServerNotifications you should call the
 MBean server method
addNotificationListener
with
ObjectName
the
ObjectName
of the
MBeanServerDelegate
.  This
ObjectName
is:
JMImplementation:type=MBeanServerDelegate
.
An object obtained from the
createMBeanServer
or
newMBeanServer
methods of the
MBeanServerFactory
class applies security
 checks to its methods, as follows.
First, if there is no security manager (
System.getSecurityManager()
is null), then an implementation of
 this interface is free not to make any checks.
Assuming that there is a security manager, or that the
 implementation chooses to make checks anyway, the checks are made
 as detailed below.  In what follows, and unless otherwise specified,
className
is the
 string returned by
MBeanInfo.getClassName()
for the target
 MBean.
If a security check fails, the method throws
SecurityException
.
For methods that can throw
InstanceNotFoundException
,
 this exception is thrown for a non-existent MBean, regardless of
 permissions.  This is because a non-existent MBean has no
className
.
For the
invoke
method, the caller's
 permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(className, operationName, name, "invoke")
.
For the
getAttribute
method, the
 caller's permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(className, attribute, name, "getAttribute")
.
For the
getAttributes
method, the
 caller's permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "getAttribute")
.
 Additionally, for each attribute
a
in the
AttributeList
, if the caller's permissions do not imply
MBeanPermission(className,
a
, name, "getAttribute")
, the
 MBean server will behave as if that attribute had not been in the
 supplied list.
For the
setAttribute
method, the
 caller's permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(className, attrName, name, "setAttribute")
, where
attrName
is
attribute.getName()
.
For the
setAttributes
method, the
 caller's permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "setAttribute")
.
 Additionally, for each attribute
a
in the
AttributeList
, if the caller's permissions do not imply
MBeanPermission(className,
a
, name, "setAttribute")
, the
 MBean server will behave as if that attribute had not been in the
 supplied list.
For the
addNotificationListener
methods,
 the caller's permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(className, null, name,
 "addNotificationListener")
.
For the
removeNotificationListener
methods,
 the caller's permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(className, null, name,
 "removeNotificationListener")
.
For the
getMBeanInfo
method, the
 caller's permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "getMBeanInfo")
.
For the
getObjectInstance
method,
 the caller's permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "getObjectInstance")
.
For the
isInstanceOf
method, the
 caller's permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "isInstanceOf")
.
For the
queryMBeans
method, the
 caller's permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(null, null, null, "queryMBeans")
.
 Additionally, for each MBean
n
that matches
name
,
 if the caller's permissions do not imply
MBeanPermission(className, null,
n
, "queryMBeans")
, the
 MBean server will behave as if that MBean did not exist.
Certain query elements perform operations on the MBean server.
 If the caller does not have the required permissions for a given
 MBean, that MBean will not be included in the result of the query.
 The standard query elements that are affected are
Query.attr(String)
,
Query.attr(String,String)
, and
Query.classattr()
.
For the
queryNames
method, the checks
 are the same as for
queryMBeans
except that
"queryNames"
is used instead of
"queryMBeans"
in the
MBeanPermission
objects.  Note that a
"queryMBeans"
permission implies
 the corresponding
"queryNames"
permission.
For the
getDomains
method, the caller's
 permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(null, null, null, "getDomains")
.  Additionally,
 for each domain
d
in the returned array, if the caller's
 permissions do not imply
MBeanPermission(null, null, new ObjectName("
d
:x=x"),
 "getDomains")
, the domain is eliminated from the array.  Here,
x=x
is any
key=value
pair, needed to
 satisfy ObjectName's constructor but not otherwise relevant.
For the
getClassLoader
method, the
 caller's permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(className, null, loaderName,
 "getClassLoader")
.
For the
getClassLoaderFor
method,
 the caller's permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(className, null, mbeanName,
 "getClassLoaderFor")
.
For the
getClassLoaderRepository
method, the caller's permissions must
 imply
MBeanPermission(null, null, null, "getClassLoaderRepository")
.
For the deprecated
deserialize
methods, the
 required permissions are the same as for the methods that replace
 them.
For the
instantiate
methods, the caller's
 permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(className, null, null, "instantiate")
,
 where
className
is the name of the class which is to
 be instantiated.
For the
registerMBean
method, the
 caller's permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "registerMBean")
.
If the
MBeanPermission
check succeeds, the MBean's
 class is validated by checking that its
ProtectionDomain
implies
MBeanTrustPermission("register")
.
Finally, if the
name
argument is null, another
MBeanPermission
check is made using the
ObjectName
returned by
MBeanRegistration.preRegister
.
For the
createMBean
methods, the caller's
 permissions must imply the permissions needed by the equivalent
instantiate
followed by
registerMBean
.
For the
unregisterMBean
method,
 the caller's permissions must imply
MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "unregisterMBean")
.

 MBean must provide its own name by implementing the
MBeanRegistration
interface
 and returning the name from the
preRegister
method.
This method is equivalent to
createMBean(className, name, (Object[]) null, (String[])
 null)

 object name is associated with the MBean. If the object name of
 the loader is not specified, the ClassLoader that loaded the
 MBean server will be used.  If the MBean object name given is
 null, the MBean must provide its own name by implementing the
MBeanRegistration
interface and returning the name from the
preRegister
method.

Description copied from interface:
MBeanServerConnection
Sets the values of several attributes of a named MBean. The MBean is
 identified by its object name.
If one or more attributes cannot be set for some reason, they will be
 omitted from the returned
AttributeList
.  The caller should check
 that the input
AttributeList
is the same size as the output one.
 To discover what problem prevented a given attribute from being retrieved,
 it will usually be possible to call
setAttribute
for that attribute, although this is not guaranteed to work.  (For
 example, the values of two attributes may have been rejected because
 they were inconsistent with each other.  Setting one of them alone might
 be allowed.)
Here is an example of calling this method and checking that it
 succeeded in setting all the requested attributes:
AttributeList inputAttrs = ...;
 AttributeList outputAttrs = mbeanServerConnection.setAttributes(
objectName, inputAttrs);
 if (inputAttrs.size() == outputAttrs.size())
     System.out.println("All attributes were set successfully");
 else {

Description copied from interface:
MBeanServerConnection
Invokes an operation on an MBean.
Because of the need for a
signature
to differentiate
 possibly-overloaded operations, it is much simpler to invoke operations
 through an
MBean proxy
where possible.  For example, suppose you have a
 Standard MBean interface like this:
public interface FooMBean {
     public int countMatches(String[] patterns, boolean ignoreCase);
 }
The
countMatches
operation can be invoked as follows:
String[] myPatterns = ...;
 int count = (Integer) mbeanServerConnection.invoke(
         objectName,
         "countMatches",
         new Object[] {myPatterns, true},
         new String[] {String[].class.getName(), boolean.class.getName()});
Alternatively, it can be invoked through a proxy as follows:
String[] myPatterns = ...;
 FooMBean fooProxy = JMX.newMBeanProxy(
         mbeanServerConnection, objectName, FooMBean.class);
 int count = fooProxy.countMatches(myPatterns, true);
Specified by:
invoke
in interface
MBeanServerConnection
Parameters:
name
- The object name of the MBean on which the method is
 to be invoked.
operationName
- The name of the operation to be invoked.
params
- An array containing the parameters to be set when
 the operation is invoked
signature
- An array containing the signature of the
 operation, an array of class names in the format returned by
Class.getName()
. The class objects will be loaded using the same
 class loader as the one used for loading the MBean on which the
 operation was invoked.
Returns:
The object returned by the operation, which represents
 the result of invoking the operation on the MBean specified.
Throws:
InstanceNotFoundException
- The MBean specified is not
 registered in the MBean server.
MBeanException
- Wraps an exception thrown by the
 MBean's invoked method.
ReflectionException
- Wraps a
java.lang.Exception
thrown while trying to invoke
 the method.

Adds a listener to a registered MBean.
A notification emitted by an MBean will be forwarded by the
 MBeanServer to the listener.  If the source of the notification
 is a reference to an MBean object, the MBean server will
 replace it by that MBean's ObjectName.  Otherwise the source is
 unchanged.
The listener object that receives notifications is the one
 that is registered with the given name at the time this method
 is called.  Even if it is subsequently unregistered, it will
 continue to receive notifications.
Specified by:
addNotificationListener
in interface
MBeanServerConnection
Parameters:
name
- The name of the MBean on which the listener should
 be added.
listener
- The object name of the listener which will
 handle the notifications emitted by the registered MBean.
filter
- The filter object. If filter is null, no
 filtering will be performed before handling notifications.
