Class MBeanInfo
java.lang.Object
javax.management.MBeanInfo
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
,
Cloneable
,
DescriptorRead
Direct Known Subclasses:
ModelMBeanInfoSupport
,
OpenMBeanInfoSupport
public class
MBeanInfo
extends
Object
implements
Cloneable
,
Serializable
,
DescriptorRead
Describes the management interface exposed by an MBean; that is,
 the set of attributes and operations which are available for
 management operations.  Instances of this class are immutable.
 Subclasses may be mutable but this is not recommended.
Usually the
MBeanInfo
for any given MBean does
 not change over the lifetime of that MBean.  Dynamic MBeans can change their
MBeanInfo
and in that case it is recommended that they emit a
Notification
with a
type
of
"jmx.mbean.info.changed"
and a
userData
that is the new
MBeanInfo
.  This is not required, but
 provides a conventional way for clients of the MBean to discover the change.
 See also the
immutableInfo
and
infoTimeout
fields in the
MBeanInfo
Descriptor
.
The contents of the
MBeanInfo
for a Dynamic MBean
 are determined by its
getMBeanInfo()
method.  This includes Open MBeans and Model
 MBeans, which are kinds of Dynamic MBeans.
The contents of the
MBeanInfo
for a Standard MBean
 are determined by the MBean server as follows:
getClassName()
returns the Java class name of the MBean
 object;
getConstructors()
returns the list of all public
 constructors in that object;
getAttributes()
returns the list of all attributes
 whose existence is deduced from the presence in the MBean interface
 of a
get
Name
,
is
Name
, or
set
Name
method that conforms to the conventions
 for Standard MBeans;
getOperations()
returns the list of all methods in
 the MBean interface that do not represent attributes;
getNotifications()
returns an empty array if the MBean
 does not implement the
NotificationBroadcaster
interface,
 otherwise the result of calling
NotificationBroadcaster.getNotificationInfo()
on it;
getDescriptor()
returns a descriptor containing the contents
 of any descriptor annotations in the MBean interface (see
@DescriptorKey
).
The description returned by
getDescription()
and the
 descriptions of the contained attributes and operations are not specified.
The remaining details of the
MBeanInfo
for a
 Standard MBean are not specified.  This includes the description of
 any contained constructors, and notifications; the names
 of parameters to constructors and operations; and the descriptions of
 constructor parameters.

Parameters:
className
- The name of the Java class of the MBean described
 by this
MBeanInfo
.  This value may be any
 syntactically legal Java class name.  It does not have to be a
 Java class known to the MBean server or to the MBean's
 ClassLoader.  If it is a Java class known to the MBean's
 ClassLoader, it is recommended but not required that the
 class's public methods include those that would appear in a
 Standard MBean implementing the attributes and operations in
 this MBeanInfo.
description
- A human readable description of the MBean (optional).
attributes
- The list of exposed attributes of the MBean.
 This may be null with the same effect as a zero-length array.
constructors
- The list of public constructors of the
 MBean.  This may be null with the same effect as a zero-length
 array.
operations
- The list of operations of the MBean.  This
 may be null with the same effect as a zero-length array.
notifications
- The list of notifications emitted.  This
 may be null with the same effect as a zero-length array.

Method Details
clone
public
Object
clone
()
Returns a shallow clone of this instance.
 The clone is obtained by simply calling
super.clone()
,
 thus calling the default native shallow cloning mechanism
 implemented by
Object.clone()
.
 No deeper cloning of any internal field is made.
Since this class is immutable, the clone method is chiefly of
 interest to subclasses.
Overrides:
clone
in class
Object
Returns:
a clone of this instance.
See Also:
Cloneable
getClassName
public
String
getClassName
()
Returns the name of the Java class of the MBean described by
 this
MBeanInfo
.
Returns:
the class name.
getDescription
public
String
getDescription
()
Returns a human readable description of the MBean.
Returns:
the description.
getAttributes
public
MBeanAttributeInfo
[]
getAttributes
()
Returns the list of attributes exposed for management.
 Each attribute is described by an
MBeanAttributeInfo
object.

 The returned array is a shallow copy of the internal array,
 which means that it is a copy of the internal array of
 references to the
MBeanAttributeInfo
objects
 but that each referenced
MBeanAttributeInfo
object is not copied.
Returns:
An array of
MBeanAttributeInfo
objects.
getOperations
public
MBeanOperationInfo
[]
getOperations
()
Returns the list of operations  of the MBean.
 Each operation is described by an
MBeanOperationInfo
object.

 The returned array is a shallow copy of the internal array,
 which means that it is a copy of the internal array of
 references to the
MBeanOperationInfo
objects
 but that each referenced
MBeanOperationInfo
object is not copied.
Returns:
An array of
MBeanOperationInfo
objects.
getConstructors
public
MBeanConstructorInfo
[]
getConstructors
()
Returns the list of the public constructors of the MBean.
 Each constructor is described by an
MBeanConstructorInfo
object.
The returned array is a shallow copy of the internal array,
 which means that it is a copy of the internal array of
 references to the
MBeanConstructorInfo
objects but
 that each referenced
MBeanConstructorInfo
object
 is not copied.
The returned list is not necessarily exhaustive.  That is,
 the MBean may have a public constructor that is not in the
 list.  In this case, the MBean server can construct another
 instance of this MBean's class using that constructor, even
 though it is not listed here.
Returns:
An array of
MBeanConstructorInfo
objects.
getNotifications
public
MBeanNotificationInfo
[]
getNotifications
()
Returns the list of the notifications emitted by the MBean.
 Each notification is described by an
MBeanNotificationInfo
object.

 The returned array is a shallow copy of the internal array,
 which means that it is a copy of the internal array of
 references to the
MBeanNotificationInfo
objects
 but that each referenced
MBeanNotificationInfo
object is not copied.
Returns:
An array of
MBeanNotificationInfo
objects.
getDescriptor
public
Descriptor
getDescriptor
()
Get the descriptor of this MBeanInfo.  Changing the returned value
 will have no affect on the original descriptor.
Specified by:
getDescriptor
in interface
DescriptorRead
Returns:
a descriptor that is either immutable or a copy of the original.
Since:
1.6
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
o)
Compare this MBeanInfo to another.  Two MBeanInfo objects
 are equal if and only if they return equal values for
getClassName()
, for
getDescription()
, and for
getDescriptor()
, and the
 arrays returned by the two objects for
getAttributes()
,
getOperations()
,
getConstructors()
, and
getNotifications()
are
 pairwise equal.  Here "equal" means
Object.equals(Object)
, not identity.
If two MBeanInfo objects return the same values in one of
 their arrays but in a different order then they are not equal.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
o
- the object to compare to.
Returns:
true if and only if
o
is an MBeanInfo that is equal
 to this one according to the rules above.
