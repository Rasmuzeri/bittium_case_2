Package javax.management.loading
package
javax.management.loading
Provides the classes which implement advanced dynamic
        loading.  See the chapter
Advanced Dynamic Loading
in
        the
JMX Specification
.
An MBean that is of a subclass of
ClassLoader
can be used as a class loader to create
        other MBeans via the method
MBeanServer.createMBean(String, ObjectName, ObjectName, Object[], String[])
, and to instantiate arbitrary
        objects via the method
MBeanServer.instantiate(String, ObjectName, Object[], String[])
.  The
MLet
class is an example of
        such an MBean.  It is a
URLClassLoader
, so the list of URLs to load classes from can
        be configured.
Additionally, an
MLet
can read a configuration
        file that specifies a set of MBeans to be registered in the same
        MBean Server as the
MLet
.
Every MBean Server has a
class loader repository
containing all MBeans registered in that MBean Server that
        are of a subclass of
ClassLoader
.  The class
        loader repository is used by the forms of the
createMBean
and
instantiate
methods
        in the
MBeanServer
interface that do not have an explicit loader parameter.  It
        is also used by the
MLet
class when it does not
        find a class in its own set of URLs.
If an MBean implements the interface
PrivateClassLoader
,
        then it is not added to the class loader repository.  The class
PrivateMLet
is a
        subclass of
MLet
that implements
PrivateClassLoader
.
