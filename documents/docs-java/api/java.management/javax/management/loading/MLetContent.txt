Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
This API is part of Management Applets (m-lets), which is a legacy feature that allows loading
 of remote MBeans. This feature is not usable without a Security Manager, which is deprecated and subject to
 removal in a future release. Consequently, this API is also deprecated and subject to removal. There is no replacement.
This class represents the contents of the
MLET
tag.
 It can be consulted by a subclass of
MLet
that overrides
 the
MLet.check
method.
Since:
1.6
