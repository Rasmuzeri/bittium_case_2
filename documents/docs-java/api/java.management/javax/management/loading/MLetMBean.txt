MLetMBean
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
This API is part of Management Applets (m-lets), which is a legacy feature that allows loading
 of remote MBeans. This feature is not usable without a Security Manager, which is deprecated and subject to
 removal in a future release. Consequently, this API is also deprecated and subject to removal. There is no replacement.
Exposes the remote management interface of the MLet
 MBean.
Since:

getMBeansFromURL
(
String

throws
ServiceNotFoundException
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Loads a text file containing MLET tags that define the MBeans
 to be added to the MBean server. The location of the text file is
 specified by a URL. The text file is read using the UTF-8
 encoding. The MBeans specified in the MLET file will be
 instantiated and registered in the MBean server.
Parameters:
url
- The URL of the text file to be loaded as String object.
Returns:
A set containing one entry per MLET tag in the m-let
 text file loaded.  Each entry specifies either the
 ObjectInstance for the created MBean, or a throwable object
 (that is, an error or an exception) if the MBean could not be
 created.
Throws:
ServiceNotFoundException
- One of the following errors
 has occurred: The m-let text file does not contain an MLET tag,
 the m-let text file is not found, a mandatory attribute of the
 MLET tag is not specified, the value of url is malformed.
