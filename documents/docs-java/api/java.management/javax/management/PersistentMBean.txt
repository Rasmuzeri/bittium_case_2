Interface PersistentMBean
All Known Subinterfaces:

All Known Implementing Classes:

public interface
PersistentMBean
This class is the interface to be implemented by MBeans that are meant to be
  persistent.  MBeans supporting this interface should call the load method during
  construction in order to prime the MBean from the persistent store.
  In the case of a ModelMBean, the store method should be called by the MBeanServer based on the descriptors in
  the ModelMBean or by the MBean itself during normal processing of the ModelMBean.

Method
Description
void
load
()
Instantiates thisMBean instance with the data found for
 the MBean in the persistent store.
void
store
()
Captures the current state of this MBean instance and
 writes it out to the persistent store.
Method Details
load
void
load
()
   throws
MBeanException
,
RuntimeOperationsException
,
InstanceNotFoundException
Instantiates thisMBean instance with the data found for
 the MBean in the persistent store.  The data loaded could include
 attribute and operation values.

 This method should be called during construction or initialization of this instance,
 and before the MBean is registered with the MBeanServer.
Throws:
MBeanException
- Wraps another exception or persistence is not supported
RuntimeOperationsException
- Wraps exceptions from the persistence mechanism
InstanceNotFoundException
- Could not find or load this MBean from persistent
                                      storage
store
void
store
()
    throws
MBeanException
,
RuntimeOperationsException
,
InstanceNotFoundException
Captures the current state of this MBean instance and
 writes it out to the persistent store.  The state stored could include
 attribute and operation values. If one of these methods of persistence is
 not supported a "serviceNotFound" exception will be thrown.
Persistence policy from the MBean and attribute descriptor is used to guide execution
 of this method. The MBean should be stored if 'persistPolicy' field is:
!= "never"
   = "always"
   = "onTimer" and now > 'lastPersistTime' + 'persistPeriod'
   = "NoMoreOftenThan" and now > 'lastPersistTime' + 'persistPeriod'
   = "onUnregister"
Do not store the MBean if 'persistPolicy' field is:
= "never"
    = "onUpdate"
    = "onTimer" && now < 'lastPersistTime' + 'persistPeriod'
Throws:
MBeanException
- Wraps another exception or persistence is not supported
RuntimeOperationsException
- Wraps exceptions from the persistence mechanism
InstanceNotFoundException
- Could not find/access the persistent store
