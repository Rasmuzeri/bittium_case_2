JMXConnector
extends
Closeable
The client end of a JMX API connector.  An object of this type can
 be used to establish a connection to a connector server.
A newly-created object of this type is unconnected.  Its
connect
method must be called before it can be used.
 However, objects created by
JMXConnectorFactory.connect
are already connected.

Method Details
connect
void
connect
()
      throws
IOException
Establishes the connection to the connector server.  This
 method is equivalent to
connect(null)
.
Throws:
IOException
- if the connection could not be made
 because of a communication problem.
SecurityException
- if the connection could not be
 made for security reasons.
connect
void
connect
(
Map
<
String
,
?> env)
throws
IOException
Establishes the connection to the connector server.
If
connect
has already been called successfully
 on this object, calling it again has no effect.  If, however,
close()
was called after
connect
, the new
connect
will throw an
IOException
.
Otherwise, either
connect
has never been called
 on this object, or it has been called but produced an
 exception.  Then calling
connect
will attempt to
 establish a connection to the connector server.
Parameters:
env
- the properties of the connection.  Properties in
 this map override properties in the map specified when the
JMXConnector
was created, if any.  This parameter
 can be null, which is equivalent to an empty map.
Throws:
IOException
- if the connection could not be made
 because of a communication problem.
SecurityException
- if the connection could not be
 made for security reasons.
getMBeanServerConnection
MBeanServerConnection
getMBeanServerConnection
()
                                        throws
IOException
Returns an
MBeanServerConnection
object
 representing a remote MBean server.  For a given
JMXConnector
, two successful calls to this method
 will usually return the same
MBeanServerConnection
object, though this is not required.
For each method in the returned
MBeanServerConnection
, calling the method causes
 the corresponding method to be called in the remote MBean
 server.  The value returned by the MBean server method is the
 value returned to the client.  If the MBean server method
 produces an
Exception
, the same
Exception
is seen by the client.  If the MBean
 server method, or the attempt to call it, produces an
Error
, the
Error
is wrapped in a
JMXServerErrorException
, which is seen by the
 client.
Calling this method is equivalent to calling
getMBeanServerConnection(null)
meaning that no delegation subject is specified and that all the
 operations called on the
MBeanServerConnection
must
 use the authenticated subject, if any.
Returns:
an object that implements the
MBeanServerConnection
interface by forwarding its
 methods to the remote MBean server.
Throws:
IOException
- if a valid
MBeanServerConnection
cannot be created, for
 instance because the connection to the remote MBean server has
 not yet been established (with the
connect
method), or it has been closed, or it has broken.

throws
IOException
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
This method supported the legacy Subject Delegation feature,
 and is only useful in conjunction with other APIs which are deprecated and
 subject to removal in a future release. Consequently, this method is also
 deprecated and subject to removal. There is no replacement.
Returns an
MBeanServerConnection
object representing
 a remote MBean server on which operations are performed on behalf of
 the supplied delegation subject. For a given
JMXConnector
and
Subject
, two successful calls to this method will
 usually return the same
MBeanServerConnection
object,
 though this is not required.
For each method in the returned
MBeanServerConnection
, calling the method causes
 the corresponding method to be called in the remote MBean
 server on behalf of the given delegation subject instead of the
 authenticated subject. The value returned by the MBean server
 method is the value returned to the client. If the MBean server
 method produces an
Exception
, the same
Exception
is seen by the client. If the MBean
 server method, or the attempt to call it, produces an
Error
, the
Error
is wrapped in a
JMXServerErrorException
, which is seen by the
 client.
Parameters:
delegationSubject
- the
Subject
on behalf of
 which requests will be performed.  Can be null, in which case
 requests will be performed on behalf of the authenticated
 Subject, if any.
Returns:
an object that implements the
MBeanServerConnection
interface by forwarding its methods to the remote MBean server on behalf
 of a given delegation subject.
Throws:
IOException
- if a valid
MBeanServerConnection
cannot be created, for instance because the connection to the remote
 MBean server has not yet been established (with the
connect
method), or it has been closed, or it has broken.
close
void
close
()
    throws
IOException
Closes the client connection to its server.  Any ongoing or new
 request using the MBeanServerConnection returned by
getMBeanServerConnection()
will get an
IOException
.
If
close
has already been called successfully
 on this object, calling it again has no effect.  If
close
has never been called, or if it was called
 but produced an exception, an attempt will be made to close the
 connection.  This attempt can succeed, in which case
close
will return normally, or it can generate an
 exception.
Closing a connection is a potentially slow operation.  For
 example, if the server has crashed, the close operation might
 have to wait for a network protocol timeout.  Callers that do
 not want to block in a close operation should do it in a
 separate thread.
Specified by:
close
in interface
AutoCloseable
Specified by:
close
in interface
Closeable
Throws:
IOException
- if the connection cannot be closed
 cleanly.  If this exception is thrown, it is not known whether
 the server end of the connection has been cleanly closed.
addConnectionNotificationListener
void
addConnectionNotificationListener
(
NotificationListener
listener,
NotificationFilter
filter,
Object
handback)
Adds a listener to be informed of changes in connection
 status.  The listener will receive notifications of type
JMXConnectionNotification
.  An implementation can send other
 types of notifications too.
Any number of listeners can be added with this method.  The
 same listener can be added more than once with the same or
 different values for the filter and handback.  There is no
 special treatment of a duplicate entry.  For example, if a
 listener is registered twice with no filter, then its
handleNotification
method will be called twice for
 each notification.
Parameters:
listener
- a listener to receive connection status
 notifications.
filter
- a filter to select which notifications are to be
 delivered to the listener, or null if all notifications are to
 be delivered.
handback
- an object to be given to the listener along
 with each notification.  Can be null.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
listener
is
 null.

removeConnectionNotificationListener
void
removeConnectionNotificationListener
(
NotificationListener
listener)
throws
ListenerNotFoundException
Removes a listener from the list to be informed of changes
 in status.  The listener must previously have been added.  If
 there is more than one matching listener, all are removed.
Parameters:
listener
- a listener to receive connection status
 notifications.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
listener
is
 null.
ListenerNotFoundException
- if the listener is not
 registered with this
JMXConnector
.

removeConnectionNotificationListener
void
removeConnectionNotificationListener
(

f,
Object
handback)
throws
ListenerNotFoundException
Removes a listener from the list to be informed of changes
 in status.  The listener must previously have been added with
 the same three parameters.  If there is more than one matching
 listener, only one is removed.
Parameters:
l
- a listener to receive connection status notifications.
f
- a filter to select which notifications are to be
 delivered to the listener.  Can be null.
handback
- an object to be given to the listener along
 with each notification.  Can be null.
Throws:
ListenerNotFoundException
- if the listener is not
 registered with this
JMXConnector
, or is not
 registered with the given filter and handback.

getConnectionId
String
getConnectionId
()
                throws
IOException
Gets this connection's ID from the connector server.  For a
 given connector server, every connection will have a unique id
 which does not change during the lifetime of the
 connection.
Returns:
the unique ID of this connection.  This is the same as
 the ID that the connector server includes in its
JMXConnectionNotification
s.  The
package description
describes the
 conventions for connection IDs.
Throws:
IOException
- if the connection ID cannot be obtained,
 for instance because the connection is closed or broken.
