Package
javax.management.remote
Class JMXConnectorFactory
java.lang.Object
javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorFactory
public class
JMXConnectorFactory
extends
Object
Factory to create JMX API connector clients.  There
 are no instances of this class.
Connections are usually made using the
connect
method of this class.  More
 advanced applications can separate the creation of the connector
 client, using
newJMXConnector
and the establishment of the connection itself, using
JMXConnector.connect(Map)
.
Each client is created by an instance of
JMXConnectorProvider
.  This instance is found as follows.  Suppose
 the given
JMXServiceURL
looks like
"service:jmx:
protocol
:
remainder
"
.
 Then the factory will attempt to find the appropriate
JMXConnectorProvider
for
protocol
.  Each
 occurrence of the character
+
or
-
in
protocol
is replaced by
.
or
_
, respectively.
A
provider package list
is searched for as follows:
If the
environment
parameter to
newJMXConnector
contains the
 key
jmx.remote.protocol.provider.pkgs
then the
 associated value is the provider package list.
Otherwise, if the system property
jmx.remote.protocol.provider.pkgs
exists, then its value
 is the provider package list.
Otherwise, there is no provider package list.
The provider package list is a string that is interpreted as a
 list of non-empty Java package names separated by vertical bars
 (
|
).  If the string is empty, then so is the provider
 package list.  If the provider package list is not a String, or if
 it contains an element that is an empty string, a
JMXProviderException
is thrown.
If the provider package list exists and is not empty, then for
 each element
pkg
of the list, the factory
 will attempt to load the class
pkg
.
protocol
.ClientProvider
If the
environment
parameter to
newJMXConnector
contains the
 key
jmx.remote.protocol.provider.class.loader
then the
 associated value is the class loader to use to load the provider.
 If the associated value is not an instance of
ClassLoader
, an
IllegalArgumentException
is thrown.
If the
jmx.remote.protocol.provider.class.loader
key is not present in the
environment
parameter, the
 calling thread's context class loader is used.
If the attempt to load this class produces a
ClassNotFoundException
, the search for a handler continues with
 the next element of the list.
Otherwise, a problem with the provider found is signalled by a
JMXProviderException
whose
cause
indicates the underlying
 exception, as follows:
if the attempt to load the class produces an exception other
 than
ClassNotFoundException
, that is the
cause
;
if
Class.newInstance()
for the class produces an
 exception, that is the
cause
.
If no provider is found by the above steps, including the
 default case where there is no provider package list, then the
 implementation will use its own provider for
protocol
, or it will throw a
MalformedURLException
if there is none.  An
 implementation may choose to find providers by other means.  For
 example, it may support
service providers
,
 where the service interface is
JMXConnectorProvider
.
Every implementation must support the RMI connector protocol with
 the default RMI transport, specified with string
rmi
.
Once a provider is found, the result of the
newJMXConnector
method is the result of calling
newJMXConnector
on the provider.
The
Map
parameter passed to the
JMXConnectorProvider
is a new read-only
Map
that contains all the entries that were in the
environment
parameter to
JMXConnectorFactory.newJMXConnector
, if there was one.
 Additionally, if the
jmx.remote.protocol.provider.class.loader
key is not
 present in the
environment
parameter, it is added to
 the new read-only
Map
.  The associated value is the
 calling thread's context class loader.

public static
JMXConnector
connect
(
JMXServiceURL
serviceURL)
throws
IOException
Creates a connection to the connector server at the given
 address.
This method is equivalent to
connect(serviceURL, null)
.
Parameters:
serviceURL
- the address of the connector server to
 connect to.
Returns:
a
JMXConnector
whose
connect
method has been called.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
serviceURL
is null.
IOException
- if the connector client or the
 connection cannot be made because of a communication problem.
SecurityException
- if the connection cannot be made
 for security reasons.

JMXConnector
connect
(
JMXServiceURL
serviceURL,
Map
<
String
,
?> environment)
throws
IOException
Creates a connection to the connector server at the given
 address.
This method is equivalent to:
JMXConnector conn = JMXConnectorFactory.newJMXConnector(serviceURL,
                                                         environment);

 connection.  Each successful call to this method produces a
 different object.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
serviceURL
is null.
IOException
- if the connector client or the
 connection cannot be made because of a communication problem.

environment
- a set of attributes to determine how the
 connection is made.  This parameter can be null.  Keys in this
 map must be Strings.  The appropriate type of each associated
 value depends on the attribute.  The contents of

 protocol in
serviceURL
.
JMXProviderException
- if there is a provider for the
 protocol in
serviceURL
but it cannot be used for
 some reason.
