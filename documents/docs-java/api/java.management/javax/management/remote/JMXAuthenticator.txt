Interface JMXAuthenticator
public interface
JMXAuthenticator
Interface to define how remote credentials are converted into a
 JAAS Subject.  This interface is used by the RMI Connector Server,
 and can be used by other connector servers.
The user-defined authenticator instance is passed to the
 connector server in the environment map as the value of the
 attribute
JMXConnectorServer.AUTHENTICATOR
.  For connector
 servers that use only this authentication system, if this attribute
 is not present or its value is
null
then no user
 authentication will be performed and full access to the methods
 exported by the
MBeanServerConnection
object will be
 allowed.
If authentication is successful then an authenticated
subject
filled in with its associated
principals
is returned. Authorization checks
 will be then performed based on the given set of principals.
Since:
1.5
