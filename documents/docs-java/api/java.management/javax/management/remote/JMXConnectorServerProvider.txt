throws
IOException
Creates a new connector server at the given address.  Each
 successful call to this method produces a different
JMXConnectorServer
object.
Parameters:
serviceURL
- the address of the new connector server.  The
 actual address of the new connector server, as returned by its
getAddress
method, will
 not necessarily be exactly the same.  For example, it might
 include a port number if the original address did not.
environment
- a read-only Map containing named attributes
 to control the new connector server's behavior.  Keys in this
 map must be Strings.  The appropriate type of each associated
 value depends on the attribute.
mbeanServer
- the MBean server that this connector server
 is attached to.  Null if this connector server will be attached
 to an MBean server by being registered in it.
Returns:
a
JMXConnectorServer
representing the new
 connector server.  Each successful call to this method produces
 a different object.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
serviceURL
or
environment
is null.
IOException
- It is recommended for a provider
 implementation to throw
MalformedURLException
if the
 protocol in the
serviceURL
is not recognized by this
 provider,
JMXProviderException
if this is a provider
 for the protocol in
serviceURL
but it cannot be used
 for some reason or any other
IOException
if the
 connector server cannot be created.
