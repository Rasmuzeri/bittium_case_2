Notification
extends
EventObject
The Notification class represents a notification emitted by an
 MBean.  It contains a reference to the source MBean: if the
 notification has been forwarded through the MBean server, and the
 original source of the notification was a reference to the emitting
 MBean object, then the MBean server replaces it by the MBean's
 ObjectName.  If the listener has registered directly with the
 MBean, this is either the object name or a direct reference to the
 MBean.
It is strongly recommended that notification senders use the
 object name rather than a reference to the MBean object as the
 source.
The
serialVersionUID
of this class is
-7516092053498031989L

Constructor Details
Notification
public
Notification
(
String
type,
Object
source,
 long sequenceNumber)
Creates a Notification object.
 The notification timeStamp is set to the current date.
Parameters:
type
- The notification type.
source
- The notification source.
sequenceNumber
- The notification sequence number within the source object.
Notification
public
Notification
(
String
type,
Object
source,
 long sequenceNumber,
String
message)
Creates a Notification object.
 The notification timeStamp is set to the current date.
Parameters:
type
- The notification type.
source
- The notification source.
sequenceNumber
- The notification sequence number within the source object.
message
- The detailed message.
Notification
public
Notification
(
String
type,
Object
source,
 long sequenceNumber,
 long timeStamp)
Creates a Notification object.
Parameters:
type
- The notification type.
source
- The notification source.
sequenceNumber
- The notification sequence number within the source object.
timeStamp
- The notification emission date.
Notification
public
Notification
(
String
type,
Object
source,
 long sequenceNumber,
 long timeStamp,
String
message)
Creates a Notification object.
Parameters:
type
- The notification type.
source
- The notification source.
sequenceNumber
- The notification sequence number within the source object.
timeStamp
- The notification emission date.
message
- The detailed message.
Method Details
setSource
public
void
setSource
(
Object
source)
Sets the source.
Parameters:
source
- the new source for this object.
See Also:
EventObject.getSource()
getSequenceNumber
public
long
getSequenceNumber
()
Get the notification sequence number.
Returns:
The notification sequence number within the source object. It's a serial number
 identifying a particular instance of notification in the context of the notification source.
 The notification model does not assume that notifications will be received in the same order
 that they are sent. The sequence number helps listeners to sort received notifications.
See Also:
setSequenceNumber(long)
setSequenceNumber
public
void
setSequenceNumber
(long sequenceNumber)
Set the notification sequence number.
Parameters:
sequenceNumber
- The notification sequence number within the source object. It is
 a serial number identifying a particular instance of notification in the
 context of the notification source.
See Also:
getSequenceNumber()
getType
public
String
getType
()
Get the notification type.
Returns:
The notification type. It's a string expressed in a dot notation
 similar to Java properties. It is recommended that the notification type
 should follow the reverse-domain-name convention used by Java package
 names.  An example of a notification type is com.example.alarm.router.
getTimeStamp
public
long
getTimeStamp
()
Get the notification timestamp.
Returns:
The notification timestamp.
See Also:
setTimeStamp(long)
setTimeStamp
public
void
setTimeStamp
(long timeStamp)
Set the notification timestamp.
Parameters:
timeStamp
- The notification timestamp. It indicates when the notification was generated.
See Also:
getTimeStamp()
getMessage
public
String
getMessage
()
Get the notification message.
Returns:
The message string of this notification object.
getUserData
public
Object
getUserData
()
Get the user data.
Returns:
The user data object. It is used for whatever data
 the notification source wishes to communicate to its consumers.
See Also:
setUserData(java.lang.Object)
setUserData
public
void
setUserData
(
Object
userData)
Set the user data.
Parameters:
userData
- The user data object. It is used for whatever data
 the notification source wishes to communicate to its consumers.
See Also:
getUserData()
toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns a String representation of this notification.
Overrides:
toString
in class
EventObject
Returns:
A String representation of this notification.
