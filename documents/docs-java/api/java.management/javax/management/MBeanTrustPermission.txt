Class MBeanTrustPermission

java.security.BasicPermission
javax.management.MBeanTrustPermission
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
,

public class
MBeanTrustPermission
extends
BasicPermission
This permission represents "trust" in a signer or codebase.
MBeanTrustPermission contains a target name but no actions list.
 A single target name, "register", is defined for this permission.
 The target "*" is also allowed, permitting "register" and any future
 targets that may be defined.
 Only the null value or the empty string are allowed for the action
 to allow the policy object to create the permissions specified in
 the policy file.
If a signer, or codesource is granted this permission, then it is
 considered a trusted source for MBeans. Only MBeans from trusted
 sources may be registered in the MBeanServer.

1.5
