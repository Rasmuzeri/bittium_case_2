of the constructed object will include
 fields contributed by any annotations on the
Method
object that contain the
DescriptorKey
meta-annotation.
Parameters:
description
- A human readable description of the operation.
method
- The
java.lang.reflect.Method
object
 describing the MBean operation.

- A human readable description of the operation.
signature
-
MBeanParameterInfo
objects
 describing the parameters(arguments) of the method.  This may be
 null with the same effect as a zero-length array.

Method Details
clone
public
Object
clone
()
Returns a shallow clone of this instance.
 The clone is obtained by simply calling
super.clone()
,
 thus calling the default native shallow cloning mechanism
 implemented by
Object.clone()
.
 No deeper cloning of any internal field is made.
Since this class is immutable, cloning is chiefly of interest
 to subclasses.
Overrides:
clone
in class
Object
Returns:
a clone of this instance.
See Also:
Cloneable
getReturnType
public
String
getReturnType
()
Returns the type of the method's return value.
Returns:
the return type.
getSignature
public
MBeanParameterInfo
[]
getSignature
()
Returns the list of parameters for this operation.  Each
 parameter is described by an
MBeanParameterInfo
object.
The returned array is a shallow copy of the internal array,
 which means that it is a copy of the internal array of
 references to the
MBeanParameterInfo
objects but
 that each referenced
MBeanParameterInfo
object is
 not copied.
Returns:
An array of
MBeanParameterInfo
objects.
getImpact
public
int
getImpact
()
Returns the impact of the method, one of
INFO, ACTION, ACTION_INFO, UNKNOWN
.
Returns:
the impact code.
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
o)
Compare this MBeanOperationInfo to another.
Overrides:
equals
in class
MBeanFeatureInfo
Parameters:
o
- the object to compare to.
Returns:
true if and only if
o
is an MBeanOperationInfo such
 that its
MBeanFeatureInfo.getName()
,
getReturnType()
,
MBeanFeatureInfo.getDescription()
,
getImpact()
,
MBeanFeatureInfo.getDescriptor()
and
getSignature()
values are equal (not necessarily identical)
 to those of this MBeanConstructorInfo.  Two signature arrays
 are equal if their elements are pairwise equal.
