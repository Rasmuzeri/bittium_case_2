Interface OpenMBeanInfo
All Known Implementing Classes:
OpenMBeanInfoSupport
public interface
OpenMBeanInfo
Describes an Open MBean: an Open MBean is recognized as such if
 its
getMBeanInfo()
method returns an instance of a class which
 implements the
OpenMBeanInfo
interface, typically
OpenMBeanInfoSupport
.
This interface declares the same methods as the class
MBeanInfo
.  A class implementing this interface
 (typically
OpenMBeanInfoSupport
) should extend
MBeanInfo
.
The
getAttributes()
,
getOperations()
and
getConstructors()
methods of the implementing class should
 return at runtime an array of instances of a subclass of
MBeanAttributeInfo
,
MBeanOperationInfo
or
MBeanConstructorInfo
respectively which implement the
OpenMBeanAttributeInfo
,
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
or
OpenMBeanConstructorInfo
interface respectively.

Method Details
getClassName
String
getClassName
()
Returns the fully qualified Java class name of the open MBean
 instances this
OpenMBeanInfo
describes.
Returns:
the class name.
getDescription
String
getDescription
()
Returns a human readable description of the type of open MBean
 instances this
OpenMBeanInfo
describes.
Returns:
the description.
getAttributes
MBeanAttributeInfo
[]
getAttributes
()
Returns an array of
OpenMBeanAttributeInfo
instances
 describing each attribute in the open MBean described by this
OpenMBeanInfo
instance.  Each instance in the returned
 array should actually be a subclass of
MBeanAttributeInfo
which implements the
OpenMBeanAttributeInfo
interface (typically
OpenMBeanAttributeInfoSupport
).
Returns:
the attribute array.
getOperations
MBeanOperationInfo
[]
getOperations
()
Returns an array of
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instances
 describing each operation in the open MBean described by this
OpenMBeanInfo
instance.  Each instance in the returned
 array should actually be a subclass of
MBeanOperationInfo
which implements the
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
interface (typically
OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
).
Returns:
the operation array.
getConstructors
MBeanConstructorInfo
[]
getConstructors
()
Returns an array of
OpenMBeanConstructorInfo
instances
 describing each constructor in the open MBean described by this
OpenMBeanInfo
instance.  Each instance in the returned
 array should actually be a subclass of
MBeanConstructorInfo
which implements the
OpenMBeanConstructorInfo
interface (typically
OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport
).
Returns:
the constructor array.
getNotifications
MBeanNotificationInfo
[]
getNotifications
()
Returns an array of
MBeanNotificationInfo
instances
 describing each notification emitted by the open MBean
 described by this
OpenMBeanInfo
instance.
Returns:
the notification array.
equals
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Compares the specified
obj
parameter with this
OpenMBeanInfo
instance for equality.
Returns
true
if and only if all of the following statements are true:
obj
is non null,
obj
also implements the
OpenMBeanInfo
interface,
their class names are equal
their infos on attributes, constructors, operations and notifications are equal
This ensures that this
equals
method works properly for
obj
parameters which are
 different implementations of the
OpenMBeanInfo
interface.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- the object to be compared for equality with this
OpenMBeanInfo
instance;
Returns:
true
if the specified object is equal to this
OpenMBeanInfo
instance.
See Also:
Object.hashCode()
HashMap
hashCode
int
hashCode
()
Returns the hash code value for this
OpenMBeanInfo
instance.
The hash code of an
OpenMBeanInfo
instance is the sum of the hash codes
 of all elements of information used in
equals
comparisons
 (ie: its class name, and its infos on attributes, constructors, operations and notifications,
 where the hashCode of each of these arrays is calculated by a call to
new java.util.HashSet(java.util.Arrays.asList(this.getSignature)).hashCode()
).
This ensures that
t1.equals(t2)
implies that
t1.hashCode()==t2.hashCode()
for any two
OpenMBeanInfo
instances
t1
and
t2
,
 as required by the general contract of the method
Object.hashCode()
.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
the hash code value for this
OpenMBeanInfo
instance
See Also:
Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)
toString
String
toString
()
Returns a string representation of this
OpenMBeanInfo
instance.
The string representation consists of the name of this class
 (ie
javax.management.openmbean.OpenMBeanInfo
), the MBean class name,
 and the string representation of infos on attributes, constructors,
 operations and notifications of the described MBean.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
a string representation of this
OpenMBeanInfo
instance
