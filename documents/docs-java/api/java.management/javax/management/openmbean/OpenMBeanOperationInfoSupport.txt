 parameters to describe.
returnOpenType
- cannot be null: use
SimpleType.VOID
for operations that return nothing.
impact

ACTION_INFO
,
INFO
, or
UNKNOWN
.
Throws:

Method Details
getReturnOpenType
public
OpenType
<?>
getReturnOpenType
()
Returns the
open type
of the values returned by the
 operation described by this
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance.
Specified by:
getReturnOpenType
in interface
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
Returns:
the return type.
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Compares the specified
obj
parameter with this
OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
instance for
 equality.
Returns
true
if and only if all of the following
 statements are true:
obj
is non null,
obj
also implements the
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
interface,
their names are equal
their signatures are equal
their return open types are equal
their impacts are equal
This ensures that this
equals
method works properly for
obj
parameters which are different implementations of
 the
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
interface.
Specified by:
equals
in interface
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
Overrides:
equals
in class
MBeanOperationInfo
Parameters:
obj
- the object to be compared for equality with this
OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
instance;
Returns:
true
if the specified object is equal to this
OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
instance.
See Also:
Object.hashCode()
HashMap
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Returns the hash code value for this
OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
instance.
The hash code of an
OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
instance is the sum of the hash codes of all elements of
 information used in
equals
comparisons (ie: its name,
 return open type, impact and signature, where the signature
 hashCode is calculated by a call to
java.util.Arrays.asList(this.getSignature).hashCode()
).
This ensures that
t1.equals(t2)
implies that
t1.hashCode()==t2.hashCode()
for any two
OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
instances
t1
and
t2
, as required by the general contract of the method
Object.hashCode()
.
However, note that another instance of a class implementing
 the
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
interface may be equal to
 this
OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
instance as defined
 by
equals(java.lang.Object)
, but may have a different
 hash code if it is calculated differently.
As
OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
instances are
 immutable, the hash code for this instance is calculated once,
 on the first call to
hashCode
, and then the same value
 is returned for subsequent calls.
Specified by:
hashCode
in interface
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
the hash code value for this
OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
instance
See Also:
Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)
toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns a string representation of this
OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
instance.
The string representation consists of the name of this class
 (ie
javax.management.openmbean.OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
), and
 the name, signature, return open type and impact of the
 described operation and the string representation of its descriptor.
As
OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
instances are
 immutable, the string representation for this instance is
 calculated once, on the first call to
toString
, and
 then the same value is returned for subsequent calls.
Specified by:
toString
in interface
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
a string representation of this
OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
instance
