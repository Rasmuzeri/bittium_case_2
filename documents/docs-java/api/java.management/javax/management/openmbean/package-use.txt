objects
 which represent
composite data
structures.

A Java class can implement this interface to indicate how it is
 to be converted into a
CompositeData
by the MXBean framework.

class whose instances describe
 all
open data
values which are n-dimensional arrays of
open data
values.

OpenDataException
This checked exception is thrown when an
open type
, an
open data
or an
open MBean metadata info
instance
 could not be constructed because one or more validity constraints were not met.
OpenMBeanAttributeInfo
Describes an attribute of an open MBean.
OpenMBeanConstructorInfo
Describes a constructor of an Open MBean.
OpenMBeanInfo
Describes an Open MBean: an Open MBean is recognized as such if
 its
getMBeanInfo()
method returns an instance of a class which
 implements the
OpenMBeanInfo
interface, typically
OpenMBeanInfoSupport
.
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
Describes an operation of an Open MBean.
OpenMBeanParameterInfo
Describes a parameter used in one or more operations or
 constructors of an open MBean.
OpenType
The
OpenType
class is the parent abstract class of all classes which describe the actual
open type
of open data values.
SimpleType
The
SimpleType
class is the
open type
class whose instances describe
 all
open data
values which are neither arrays,
 nor
CompositeData
values,
 nor
TabularData
values.
TabularData
The
TabularData
interface specifies the behavior of a specific type of complex
open data
objects
 which represent
tabular data
structures.
TabularType
The
TabularType
class is the
open type
class
 whose instances describe the types of
TabularData
