Interface OpenMBeanOperationInfo
All Known Implementing Classes:
OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
public interface
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
Describes an operation of an Open MBean.
This interface declares the same methods as the class
MBeanOperationInfo
.  A class implementing this
 interface (typically
OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport
) should
 extend
MBeanOperationInfo
.
The
getSignature()
method should return at runtime an
 array of instances of a subclass of
MBeanParameterInfo
which implements the
OpenMBeanParameterInfo
interface
 (typically
OpenMBeanParameterInfoSupport
).
Since:

of the values returned by the
 operation described by this
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance.

Method Details
getDescription
String
getDescription
()
Returns a human readable description of the operation
 described by this
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance.
Returns:
the description.
getName
String
getName
()
Returns the name of the operation
 described by this
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance.
Returns:
the name.
getSignature
MBeanParameterInfo
[]
getSignature
()
Returns an array of
OpenMBeanParameterInfo
instances
 describing each parameter in the signature of the operation
 described by this
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance.
 Each instance in the returned array should actually be a
 subclass of
MBeanParameterInfo
which implements the
OpenMBeanParameterInfo
interface (typically
OpenMBeanParameterInfoSupport
).
Returns:
the signature.
getImpact
int
getImpact
()
Returns an
int
constant qualifying the impact of the
 operation described by this
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance.

 The returned constant is one of
MBeanOperationInfo.INFO
,
MBeanOperationInfo.ACTION
,
MBeanOperationInfo.ACTION_INFO
, or
MBeanOperationInfo.UNKNOWN
.
Returns:
the impact code.
getReturnType
String
getReturnType
()
Returns the fully qualified Java class name of the values
 returned by the operation described by this
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance.  This method should
 return the same value as a call to
getReturnOpenType().getClassName()
.
Returns:
the return type.
getReturnOpenType
OpenType
<?>
getReturnOpenType
()
Returns the
open type
of the values returned by the
 operation described by this
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance.
Returns:
the return type.
equals
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Compares the specified
obj
parameter with this
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance for equality.
Returns
true
if and only if all of the following statements are true:
obj
is non null,
obj
also implements the
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
interface,
their names are equal
their signatures are equal
their return open types are equal
their impacts are equal
This ensures that this
equals
method works properly for
obj
parameters which are
 different implementations of the
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
interface.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- the object to be compared for equality with this
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance;
Returns:
true
if the specified object is equal to this
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance.
See Also:
Object.hashCode()
HashMap
hashCode
int
hashCode
()
Returns the hash code value for this
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance.
The hash code of an
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance is the sum of the hash codes
 of all elements of information used in
equals
comparisons
 (ie: its name, return open type, impact and signature,
 where the signature hashCode is calculated by a call to
java.util.Arrays.asList(this.getSignature).hashCode()
).
This ensures that
t1.equals(t2)
implies that
t1.hashCode()==t2.hashCode()
for any two
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instances
t1
and
t2
,
 as required by the general contract of the method
Object.hashCode()
.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
the hash code value for this
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance
See Also:
Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)
toString
String
toString
()
Returns a string representation of this
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance.
The string representation consists of the name of this class
 (ie
javax.management.openmbean.OpenMBeanOperationInfo
),
 and the name, signature, return open type and impact of the described operation.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
a string representation of this
OpenMBeanOperationInfo
instance
