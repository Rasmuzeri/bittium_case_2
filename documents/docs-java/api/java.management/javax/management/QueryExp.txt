Interface QueryExp
All Superinterfaces:
Serializable
All Known Implementing Classes:
ObjectName
public interface
QueryExp
extends
Serializable
Represents relational constraints similar to database query "where
 clauses". Instances of QueryExp are returned by the static methods of the
Query
class.
It is possible, but not
 recommended, to create custom queries by implementing this
 interface.  In that case, it is better to extend the
QueryEval
class than to implement the interface directly, so that
 the
setMBeanServer(javax.management.MBeanServer)
method works correctly.
Since:
1.5
