Interface GarbageCollectorMXBean
All Superinterfaces:
MemoryManagerMXBean
,
PlatformManagedObject
All Known Subinterfaces:
GarbageCollectorMXBean
public interface
GarbageCollectorMXBean
extends
MemoryManagerMXBean
The management interface for the garbage collection of
 the Java virtual machine.  Garbage collection is the process
 that the Java virtual machine uses to find and reclaim unreachable
 objects to free up memory space.  A garbage collector is one type of
memory manager
.
A Java virtual machine may have one or more instances of
 the implementation class of this interface.
 An instance implementing this interface is
 an
MXBean
that can be obtained by calling
 the
ManagementFactory.getGarbageCollectorMXBeans()
method or
 from the
platform MBeanServer
method.
The
ObjectName
for uniquely identifying the MXBean for
 a garbage collector within an MBeanServer is:
java.lang:type=GarbageCollector
,name=
collector's name
It can be obtained by calling the
PlatformManagedObject.getObjectName()
method.

 A platform usually includes additional platform-dependent information
 specific to a garbage collection algorithm for monitoring.

Method Details
getCollectionCount
long
getCollectionCount
()
Returns the total number of collections that have occurred.
 This method returns
-1
if the collection count is undefined for
 this collector.
Returns:
the total number of collections that have occurred.
getCollectionTime
long
getCollectionTime
()
Returns the approximate accumulated collection elapsed time
 in milliseconds.  This method returns
-1
if the collection
 elapsed time is undefined for this collector.
The Java virtual machine implementation may use a high resolution
 timer to measure the elapsed time.  This method may return the
 same value even if the collection count has been incremented
 if the collection elapsed time is very short.
Returns:
the approximate accumulated collection elapsed time
 in milliseconds.
