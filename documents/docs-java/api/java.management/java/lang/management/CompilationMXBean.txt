Interface CompilationMXBean
All Superinterfaces:
PlatformManagedObject
public interface
CompilationMXBean
extends
PlatformManagedObject
The management interface for the compilation system of
 the Java virtual machine.
A Java virtual machine has a single instance of the implementation
 class of this interface.  This instance implementing this interface is
 an
MXBean
that can be obtained by calling
 the
ManagementFactory.getCompilationMXBean()
method or
 from the
platform MBeanServer
method.
The
ObjectName
for uniquely identifying the MXBean for
 the compilation system within an MBeanServer is:
java.lang:type=Compilation
It can be obtained by calling the
PlatformManagedObject.getObjectName()
method.
Since:
1.5

Method
Description
String
getName
()
Returns the name of the Just-in-time (JIT) compiler.
long
getTotalCompilationTime
()
Returns the approximate accumulated elapsed time (in milliseconds)
 spent in compilation.
boolean
isCompilationTimeMonitoringSupported
()
Tests if the Java virtual machine supports the monitoring of
 compilation time.

Method Details
getName
String
getName
()
Returns the name of the Just-in-time (JIT) compiler.
Returns:
the name of the JIT compiler.
isCompilationTimeMonitoringSupported
boolean
isCompilationTimeMonitoringSupported
()
Tests if the Java virtual machine supports the monitoring of
 compilation time.
Returns:
true
if the monitoring of compilation time is
 supported;
false
otherwise.
getTotalCompilationTime
long
getTotalCompilationTime
()
Returns the approximate accumulated elapsed time (in milliseconds)
 spent in compilation.
 If multiple threads are used for compilation, this value is
 summation of the approximate time that each thread spent in compilation.
This method is optionally supported by the platform.
 A Java virtual machine implementation may not support the compilation
 time monitoring. The
isCompilationTimeMonitoringSupported()
method can be used to determine if the Java virtual machine
 supports this operation.
This value does not indicate the level of performance of
 the Java virtual machine and is not intended for performance comparisons
 of different virtual machine implementations.
 The implementations may have different definitions and different
 measurements of the compilation time.
Returns:
Compilation time in milliseconds
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException
- if the Java
 virtual machine does not support
 this operation.
