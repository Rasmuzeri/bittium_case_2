Interface ClassLoadingMXBean
All Superinterfaces:
PlatformManagedObject
public interface
ClassLoadingMXBean
extends
PlatformManagedObject
The management interface for the class loading system of
 the Java virtual machine.
A Java virtual machine has a single instance of the implementation
 class of this interface.  This instance implementing this interface is
 an
MXBean
that can be obtained by calling
 the
ManagementFactory.getClassLoadingMXBean()
method or
 from the
platform MBeanServer
.
The
ObjectName
for uniquely identifying the MXBean for
 the class loading system within an
MBeanServer
is:
java.lang:type=ClassLoading
It can be obtained by calling the
PlatformManagedObject.getObjectName()
method.
Since:
1.5

Method Details
getTotalLoadedClassCount
long
getTotalLoadedClassCount
()
Returns the total number of classes that have been loaded since
 the Java virtual machine has started execution.
Returns:
the total number of classes loaded.
getLoadedClassCount
int
getLoadedClassCount
()
Returns the number of classes that are currently loaded in the
 Java virtual machine.
Returns:
the number of currently loaded classes.
getUnloadedClassCount
long
getUnloadedClassCount
()
Returns the total number of classes unloaded since the Java virtual machine
 has started execution.
Returns:
the total number of unloaded classes.
isVerbose
boolean
isVerbose
()
Tests if the verbose output for the class loading system is enabled.
Returns:
true
if the verbose output for the class loading
 system is enabled;
false
otherwise.
setVerbose
void
setVerbose
(boolean value)
Enables or disables the verbose output for the class loading
 system.  The verbose output information and the output stream
 to which the verbose information is emitted are implementation
 dependent.  Typically, a Java virtual machine implementation
 prints a message each time a class file is loaded.
This method can be called by multiple threads concurrently.
 Each invocation of this method enables or disables the verbose
 output globally.
Parameters:
value
-
true
to enable the verbose output;
false
to disable.
Throws:
SecurityException
- if a security manager
          exists and the caller does not have
          ManagementPermission("control").
