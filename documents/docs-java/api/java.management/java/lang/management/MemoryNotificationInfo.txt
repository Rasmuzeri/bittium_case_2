Class MemoryNotificationInfo
java.lang.Object
java.lang.management.MemoryNotificationInfo
public class
MemoryNotificationInfo
extends
Object
The information about a memory notification.
A memory notification is emitted by
MemoryMXBean
when the Java virtual machine detects that the memory usage
 of a memory pool is exceeding a threshold value.
 The notification emitted will contain the memory notification
 information about the detected condition:
The name of the memory pool.
The memory usage of the memory pool when the notification
       was constructed.
The number of times that the memory usage has crossed
       a threshold when the notification was constructed.
       For usage threshold notifications, this count will be the
usage threshold
       count
.  For collection threshold notifications,
       this count will be the
collection usage threshold count
.
A
CompositeData
representing
 the
MemoryNotificationInfo
object
 is stored in the
user data
of a
notification
.
 The
from
method is provided to convert from
 a
CompositeData
to a
MemoryNotificationInfo
object. For example:
Notification notif;

      // receive the notification emitted by MemoryMXBean and set to notif
      ...

      String notifType = notif.getType();
      if (notifType.equals(MemoryNotificationInfo.MEMORY_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED) ||
          notifType.equals(MemoryNotificationInfo.MEMORY_COLLECTION_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED)) {
          // retrieve the memory notification information
          CompositeData cd = (CompositeData) notif.getUserData();
          MemoryNotificationInfo info = MemoryNotificationInfo.from(cd);
          ....
      }
The types of notifications emitted by
MemoryMXBean
are:
A
usage threshold exceeded notification
.
This notification will be emitted when
       the memory usage of a memory pool is increased and has reached
       or exceeded its
usage threshold
value.
       Subsequent crossing of the usage threshold value does not cause
       further notification until the memory usage has returned
       to become less than the usage threshold value.
A
collection usage threshold exceeded notification
.
This notification will be emitted when
       the memory usage of a memory pool is greater than or equal to its
collection usage threshold
after the Java virtual machine
       has expended effort in recycling unused objects in that
       memory pool.
Since:

String
MEMORY_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED
Notification type denoting that
 the memory usage of a memory pool has
 reached or exceeded its
usage threshold
value.
 This notification is emitted by
MemoryMXBean
.
 Subsequent crossing of the usage threshold value does not cause
 further notification until the memory usage has returned
 to become less than the usage threshold value.
 The value of this notification type is
