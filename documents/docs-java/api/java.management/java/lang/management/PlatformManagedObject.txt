public interface
PlatformManagedObject
A platform managed object is a
JMX MXBean
for monitoring and managing a component in the Java platform.
 Each platform managed object has a unique
object name
for the
platform MBeanServer
access.
 All platform MXBeans will implement this interface.
Note:
 The platform MXBean interfaces (i.e. all subinterfaces
 of
PlatformManagedObject
) are implemented
 by the Java platform only.  New methods may be added in these interfaces
 in future Java SE releases.
 In addition, this
PlatformManagedObject
interface is only
 intended for the management interfaces for the platform to extend but
 not for applications.
Since:
1.7
