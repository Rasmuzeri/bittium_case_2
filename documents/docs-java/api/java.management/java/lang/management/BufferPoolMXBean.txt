Interface BufferPoolMXBean
All Superinterfaces:
PlatformManagedObject
public interface
BufferPoolMXBean
extends
PlatformManagedObject
The management interface for a buffer pool, for example a pool of
direct
or
mapped
buffers.
A class implementing this interface is an
MXBean
. A Java
 virtual machine has one or more implementations of this interface. The
getPlatformMXBeans
method can be used to obtain the list of
BufferPoolMXBean
objects
 representing the management interfaces for pools of buffers as follows:
List<BufferPoolMXBean> pools = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMXBeans(BufferPoolMXBean.class);
The management interfaces are also registered with the platform
MBeanServer
. The
ObjectName
that uniquely identifies the
 management interface within the
MBeanServer
takes the form:
java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=
pool name
where
pool name
is the
name
of the buffer pool.

Method
Description
long
getCount
()
Returns an estimate of the number of buffers in the pool.
long
getMemoryUsed
()
Returns an estimate of the memory that the Java virtual machine is using
 for this buffer pool.
String
getName
()
Returns the name representing this buffer pool.

Method Details
getName
String
getName
()
Returns the name representing this buffer pool.
Returns:
The name of this buffer pool.
getCount
long
getCount
()
Returns an estimate of the number of buffers in the pool.
Returns:
An estimate of the number of buffers in this pool
getTotalCapacity
long
getTotalCapacity
()
Returns an estimate of the total capacity of the buffers in this pool.
 A buffer's capacity is the number of elements it contains and the value
 returned by this method is an estimate of the total capacity of buffers
 in the pool in bytes.
Returns:
An estimate of the total capacity of the buffers in this pool
          in bytes
getMemoryUsed
long
getMemoryUsed
()
Returns an estimate of the memory that the Java virtual machine is using
 for this buffer pool. The value returned by this method may differ
 from the estimate of the total
capacity
of
 the buffers in this pool. This difference is explained by alignment,
 memory allocator, and other implementation specific reasons.
Returns:
An estimate of the memory that the Java virtual machine is using
          for this buffer pool in bytes, or
-1L
if an estimate of
          the memory usage is not available
