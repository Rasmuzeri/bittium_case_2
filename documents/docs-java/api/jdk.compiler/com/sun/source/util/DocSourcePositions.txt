Interface DocSourcePositions
All Superinterfaces:
SourcePositions
public interface
DocSourcePositions
extends
SourcePositions
Provides methods to obtain the position of a DocTree within a javadoc comment.
 A position is defined as a simple character offset from the start of a
 CompilationUnit where the first character is at offset 0.
Since:
1.8

Method Details
getStartPosition
long

(
CompilationUnitTree
file,
DocCommentTree
comment,
DocTree
tree)
Returns the starting position of the tree within the comment within the file.  If tree is not found within
 file, or if the starting position is not available,
 returns
Diagnostic.NOPOS
.
 The given tree should be under the given comment tree, and the given documentation
 comment tree should be returned from a
DocTrees.getDocCommentTree(com.sun.source.util.TreePath)
for a tree under the given file.
 The returned position must be at the start of the yield of this tree, that
 is for any sub-tree of this tree, the following must hold:
getStartPosition(file, comment, tree) <= getStartPosition(file, comment, subtree)
or
getStartPosition(file, comment, tree) == NOPOS
or
getStartPosition(file, comment, subtree) == NOPOS
Parameters:
file
- compilation unit in which to find tree
comment
- the comment tree that encloses the tree for which the
                position is being sought
tree
- tree for which a position is sought
Returns:
the start position of tree
getEndPosition
long
getEndPosition
(
CompilationUnitTree
file,
DocCommentTree
comment,
DocTree
tree)
Returns the ending position of the tree within the comment within the file.  If tree is not found within
 file, or if the ending position is not available,
 returns
Diagnostic.NOPOS
.
 The given tree should be under the given comment tree, and the given documentation
 comment tree should be returned from a
DocTrees.getDocCommentTree(com.sun.source.util.TreePath)
for a tree under the given file.
 The returned position must be at the end of the yield of this tree,
 that is for any sub-tree of this tree, the following must hold:
getEndPosition(file, comment, tree) >= getEndPosition(file, comment, subtree)
or
getEndPosition(file, comment, tree) == NOPOS
or
getEndPosition(file, comment, subtree) == NOPOS
In addition, the following must hold:
getStartPosition(file, comment, tree) <= getEndPosition(file, comment, tree)
or
getStartPosition(file, comment, tree) == NOPOS
or
getEndPosition(file, comment, tree) == NOPOS
Parameters:
file
- compilation unit in which to find tree
comment
- the comment tree that encloses the tree for which the
                position is being sought
tree
- tree for which a position is sought
Returns:
the end position of tree
