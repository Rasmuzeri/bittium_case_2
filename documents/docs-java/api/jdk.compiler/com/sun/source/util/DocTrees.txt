e,
String
relativePath)
throws
IOException
Returns the doc comment tree of the given file whose path is
 specified relative to the given element. The file must be an HTML
 file, in which case the doc comment tree represents the contents
 of the <body> tag, and any enclosing tags are ignored.
 Returns
null
if no doc comment was found.
 Future releases may support additional file types.
Implementation Note:
The default implementation of this method returns a
 new
DocCommentTree
instance for each invocation.
Parameters:

getDocTreePath
(
FileObject
fileObject,
PackageElement
packageElement)
Returns a doc tree path containing the doc comment tree of the given file.
 The file must be an HTML file, in which case the doc comment tree represents
 the contents of the
<body>
tag, and any enclosing tags are ignored.

{@link}
tags in the doc comment tree will be evaluated in the
 context of the given package element.
 Returns
null
if no doc comment was found.
Parameters:
fileObject
- a file object encapsulating the HTML content
packageElement
- a package element to associate with the given file object
