file,
Tree
tree)
Returns the starting position of tree within file.  If tree is not found within
 file, or if the starting position is not available,
 returns
Diagnostic.NOPOS
.
 The returned position must be at the start of the yield of this tree, that
 is for any sub-tree of this tree, the following must hold:
getStartPosition(file, tree) <= getStartPosition(file, subtree)
or
getStartPosition(file, tree) == NOPOS
or
getStartPosition(file, subtree) == NOPOS
Parameters:
file
- CompilationUnit in which to find tree
tree
- tree for which a position is sought
Returns:
the start position of tree
getEndPosition

(
CompilationUnitTree
file,
Tree
tree)
Returns the ending position of tree within file.  If tree is not found within
 file, or if the ending position is not available,
 returns
Diagnostic.NOPOS
.
 The returned position must be at the end of the yield of this tree,
 that is for any sub-tree of this tree, the following must hold:
getEndPosition(file, tree) >= getEndPosition(file, subtree)
or
getEndPosition(file, tree) == NOPOS
or
getEndPosition(file, subtree) == NOPOS
In addition, the following must hold:
getStartPosition(file, tree) <= getEndPosition(file, tree)
or
getStartPosition(file, tree) == NOPOS
or
getEndPosition(file, tree) == NOPOS
Parameters:
file
- CompilationUnit in which to find tree
tree
- tree for which a position is sought
Returns:
the end position of tree
