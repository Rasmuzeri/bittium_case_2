Interface Scope
public interface
Scope
Interface for determining locally available program elements, such as
 local variables and imports.
 Upon creation, a Scope is associated with a given program position;
 for example, a
tree node
. This position may be used to
 infer an enclosing method and/or class.
A Scope does not itself contain the details of the elements corresponding
 to the parameters, methods and fields of the methods and classes containing
 its position. However, these elements can be determined from the enclosing
 elements.
Scopes may be contained in an enclosing scope. The outermost scope contains
 those elements available via "star import" declarations; the scope within that
 contains the top level elements of the compilation unit, including any named
 imports.
