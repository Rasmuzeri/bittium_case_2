javax.annotation.processing
Facilities for declaring annotation processors and for
 allowing annotation processors to communicate with an annotation processing
 tool environment.
Unless otherwise specified in a particular implementation, the
 collections returned by methods in this package should be expected
 to be unmodifiable by the caller and unsafe for concurrent access.
Unless otherwise specified, methods in this package will throw
 a
NullPointerException
if given a
null
argument.
Since:
1.6

Description
AbstractProcessor
An abstract annotation processor designed to be a convenient
 superclass for most concrete annotation processors.
Completion
A suggested
completion
for an
 annotation.
Completions
Utility class for assembling
Completion
objects.
Filer
This interface supports the creation of new files by an annotation
 processor.
FilerException
Indicates a
Filer
detected an attempt to open a file that
 would violate the guarantees provided by the
Filer
.
Generated
The Generated annotation is used to mark source code that has been generated.
Messager
A
Messager
provides the way for an annotation processor to
 report error messages, warnings, and other notices.
ProcessingEnvironment
An annotation processing tool framework will
provide an annotation processor with an object
 implementing this interface
so the processor can use facilities
 provided by the framework to write new files, report error
 messages, and find other utilities.
Processor
The interface for an annotation processor.
RoundEnvironment
An annotation processing tool framework will
provide an annotation processor with an object
 implementing this interface
so that the processor can query for
 information about a round of annotation processing.
SupportedAnnotationTypes
An annotation used to indicate what annotation interfaces an
 annotation processor supports.
SupportedOptions
An annotation used to indicate what options an annotation processor
 supports.
SupportedSourceVersion
An annotation used to indicate the latest source version an
 annotation processor supports.
