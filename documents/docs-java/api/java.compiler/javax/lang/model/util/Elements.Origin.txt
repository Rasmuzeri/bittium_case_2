<

The
origin
of an element or other language model
 item. The origin of an element or item models how a construct
 in a program is declared in the source code, explicitly,
 implicitly, etc.
Note that it is possible additional kinds of origin values
 will be added in future versions of the platform.

Enum Constant
Description
EXPLICIT
Describes a construct explicitly declared in source code.
MANDATED
A mandated construct is one that is not explicitly declared
 in the source code, but whose presence is mandated by the
 specification.
SYNTHETIC
A synthetic construct is one that is neither implicitly nor
 explicitly declared in the source code.

Enum Constant Details
EXPLICIT
public static final
Elements.Origin
EXPLICIT
Describes a construct explicitly declared in source code.
MANDATED
public static final
Elements.Origin
MANDATED
A mandated construct is one that is not explicitly declared
 in the source code, but whose presence is mandated by the
 specification. Such a construct is said to be implicitly
 declared.

 One example of a mandated element is a
default
 constructor
in a class that contains no explicit
 constructor declarations.

 Another example of a mandated construct is an implicitly
 declared
container annotation
used to hold
 multiple annotations of a repeatable annotation interface.

8.8.9 Default Constructor
8.9.3 Enum Members
8.10.3 Record Members
9.6.3 Repeatable Annotation Interfaces
9.7.5 Multiple Annotations of the Same Interface
SYNTHETIC
public static final
Elements.Origin
SYNTHETIC
A synthetic construct is one that is neither implicitly nor
 explicitly declared in the source code. Such a construct is
 typically a translation artifact created by a compiler.

()
Returns an array containing the constants of this enum class, in
the order they are declared.
Returns:
an array containing the constants of this enum class, in the order they are declared
valueOf
public static
Elements.Origin
valueOf
(
String
name)
Returns the enum constant of this class with the specified name.
The string must match
exactly
an identifier used to declare an
enum constant in this class.  (Extraneous whitespace characters are 
not permitted.)
Parameters:
name
- the name of the enum constant to be returned.
Returns:
the enum constant with the specified name
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if this enum class has no constant with the specified name
NullPointerException
- if the argument is null

 that are implicitly or explicitly declared,
false
otherwise.
Returns:
