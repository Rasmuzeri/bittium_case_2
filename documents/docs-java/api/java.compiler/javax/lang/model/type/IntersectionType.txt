Interface IntersectionType
All Superinterfaces:
AnnotatedConstruct
,
TypeMirror
public interface
IntersectionType
extends
TypeMirror
Represents an intersection type.
An intersection type can be either implicitly or explicitly
 declared in a program. For example, the bound of the type parameter
<T extends Number & Runnable>
is an (implicit) intersection
 type.  This is represented by an
IntersectionType
with
Number
and
Runnable
as its bounds.
Implementation Note:
In the reference implementation an
IntersectionType
is used to model the explicit target type of a
 cast expression.
