Interface ExecutableType
All Superinterfaces:
AnnotatedConstruct
,
TypeMirror
public interface
ExecutableType
extends
TypeMirror
Represents the type of an executable.  An
executable
is a method, constructor, or initializer.
The executable is
 represented as when viewed as a method (or constructor or
 initializer) of some reference type.
 If that reference type is parameterized, then its actual
 type arguments are substituted into any types returned by the methods of
 this interface.
Since:
1.6
