Package javax.lang.model
package
javax.lang.model
Types and hierarchies of packages comprising a
Java language model
, a model of the declarations and types of the Java
 programming language.

 The members of this package and its subpackages are for use in
 language modeling and language processing tasks and APIs including,
 but not limited to, the
annotation processing
framework.
This language model follows a
mirror
-based design; see
Gilad Bracha and David Ungar.
Mirrors: Design Principles for
 Meta-level Facilities of Object-Oriented Programming Languages
.
 In Proc. of the ACM Conf. on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems,
 Languages and Applications, October 2004.
In particular, the model makes a distinction between declared
 language constructs, like the
element
representing
java.util.Set
, and the family of
types
that may be associated
 with an element, like the raw type
java.util.Set
,
java.util.Set<String>
, and
java.util.Set<T>
.
Unless otherwise specified, methods in this package will throw
 a
NullPointerException
if given a
null
argument.
