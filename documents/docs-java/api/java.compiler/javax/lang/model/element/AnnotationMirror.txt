Interface AnnotationMirror
public interface
AnnotationMirror
Represents an annotation.  An annotation associates a value with
 each element of an annotation interface.
Annotations should be compared using the

method.  There is no guarantee that any particular annotation will
 always be represented by the same object.

Method Details
getAnnotationType
DeclaredType
getAnnotationType
()
Returns the type of this annotation.
Returns:
the type of this annotation
getElementValues
Map
<? extends
ExecutableElement
,
? extends
AnnotationValue
>
getElementValues
()
Returns the values of this annotation's elements.
 This is returned in the form of a map that associates elements
 with their corresponding values.
 Only those elements with values explicitly present in the
 annotation are included, not those that are implicitly assuming
 their default values.
 The order of the map matches the order in which the
 values appear in the annotation's source.
API Note:
An annotation mirror of a marker annotation interface
 will by definition have an empty map.
To fill in default values, use
getElementValuesWithDefaults
.
Returns:
the values of this annotation's elements,
          or an empty map if there are none
