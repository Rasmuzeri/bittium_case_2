Interface Name
All Superinterfaces:
CharSequence
public interface
Name
extends
CharSequence
An immutable sequence of characters.  When created by the same
 implementation, objects implementing this interface must obey the
 general
equals contract
when compared
 with each other.  Therefore,
Name
objects from the same
 implementation are usable in collections while
Name
s from
 different implementations may not work properly in collections.
An
empty
Name
has a
length
of
 zero.
In the context of
annotation
 processing
, the guarantees for "the same" implementation must
 include contexts where the
API mediated
side effects of
processors
could be visible
 to each other, including successive annotation processing
rounds
.

equals
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Returns
true
if the argument represents the same
 name as
this
, and
false
otherwise.
Note that the identity of a
Name
is a function both
 of its content in terms of a sequence of characters as well as
 the implementation which created it.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- the object to be compared with this element
Returns:
true
if the specified object represents the same
          name as this

Element.equals(java.lang.Object)
hashCode
int
hashCode
()
Obeys the general contract of
Object.hashCode
.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
a hash code value for this object.

equals(java.lang.Object)
contentEquals
boolean
contentEquals
(
CharSequence
cs)
Compares this name to the specified
CharSequence
. The result
 is
true
if and only if this name represents the same sequence
 of
char
values as the specified sequence.
Parameters:
cs
- The sequence to compare this name against
Returns:
true
if this name represents the same sequence
 of
char
values as the specified sequence,
false
otherwise
