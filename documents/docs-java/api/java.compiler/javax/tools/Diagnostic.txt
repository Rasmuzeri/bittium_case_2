Interface Diagnostic<S>
Type Parameters:
S
- the type of source object used by this diagnostic
public interface
Diagnostic<S>
Interface for diagnostics from tools.  A diagnostic usually reports
 a problem at a specific position in a source file.  However, not
 all diagnostics are associated with a position or a file.
A position is a zero-based character offset from the beginning of
 a file.  Negative values (except
NOPOS
) are not valid
 positions.
Line and column numbers begin at 1.  Negative values (except
NOPOS
) and 0 are not valid line or column numbers.
Since:
