Kinds of diagnostics, for example, error or warning.

 The kind of a diagnostic can be used to determine how the
 diagnostic should be presented to the user. For example,
 errors might be colored red or prefixed with the word "Error",
 while warnings might be colored yellow or prefixed with the
 word "Warning". There is no requirement that the Kind
 should imply any inherent semantic meaning to the message
 of the diagnostic: for example, a tool might provide an
 option to report all warnings as errors.
