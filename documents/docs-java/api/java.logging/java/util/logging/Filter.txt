Filter
A Filter can be used to provide fine grain control over
 what is logged, beyond the control provided by log levels.
Each Logger and each Handler can have a filter associated with it.
 The Logger or Handler will call the isLoggable method to check
 if a given LogRecord should be published.  If isLoggable returns
 false, the LogRecord will be discarded.
Since:
