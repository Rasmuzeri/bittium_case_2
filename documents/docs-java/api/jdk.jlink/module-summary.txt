Module jdk.jlink
module
jdk.jlink
Defines the
jlink
tool for creating run-time
 images, the
jmod
tool for creating and manipulating
 JMOD files, and the
jimage
tool for inspecting
 the JDK implementation-specific container file for classes and resources.
This module provides the equivalent of command-line access to the
jlink
and
jmod
tools via the
ToolProvider
SPI.
 Instances of the tools can be obtained by calling
ToolProvider.findFirst
or the
service loader
with the name
"jlink"
or
"jmod"
as appropriate.
jimage
only exists
 as a command-line tool, and does not provide any direct API.
