Package java.lang.instrument

java.lang.instrument
Provides services that allow Java programming language agents to instrument
 programs running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The mechanism for
 instrumentation is modification of the bytecodes of methods.
The class files that comprise an agent are packaged into a JAR file, either
 with the application in an executable JAR, or more commonly, as a separate JAR file
 called an
agent JAR
. An attribute in the main manifest of the JAR file
 identifies one of the class files in the JAR file as the
agent class
.
 The agent class defines a special method that the JVM invokes to
start
the agent.
Agents that are packaged with an application in an executable JAR are started
 at JVM statup time. Agents that are packaged into an agent JAR file may be started
 at JVM startup time via a command line option, or where an implementation supports
 it, started in a running JVM.
Agents can transform classes in arbitrary ways at load time, transform
 modules, or transform the bytecode of methods of already loaded classes.
 Developers or administrators that deploy agents, deploy applications that
 package an agent with the application, or use tools that load agents into a
 running application, are responsible for verifying the trustworthiness of each
 agent including the content and structure of the agent JAR file.
Starting an agent
Starting an agent packaged with an application in an executable JAR file
The
JAR File Specification
defines
 manifest attributes for standalone applications that are packaged as
executable
 JAR files
. If an implementation supports a mechanism to start an application as
 an executable JAR, then the main manifest of the JAR file can include the
Launcher-Agent-Class
attribute to specify the binary name of the Java agent
 class that is packaged with the application. If the attribute is present then the
 JVM starts the agent by loading the agent class and invoking its
agentmain
method. The method is invoked before the application
main
method is invoked.
 The
agentmain
method has one of two possible signatures. The JVM first
 attempts to invoke the following method on the agent class:
public static void agentmain(String agentArgs, Instrumentation inst)
If the agent class does not define this method then the JVM will attempt
 to invoke:
public static void agentmain(String agentArgs)
The value of the
agentArgs
parameter is always the empty string. In
 the first method, the
inst
parameter is an
Instrumentation
object
 that the agent can use to instrument code.
The
agentmain
method should do any necessary initialization
 required to start the agent and return. If the agent cannot be started, for
 example the agent class cannot be loaded, the agent class does not define a
 conformant
agentmain
method, or the
agentmain
method throws
 an uncaught exception or error, the JVM will abort before the application
main
method is invoked.
Starting an agent from the command-line interface
Where an implementation provides a means to start agents from the command-line
 interface, an agent JAR is specified via the following command line option:
-javaagent:<jarpath>[=<options>]
where
<jarpath>
is the path to the agent JAR file and
<options>
is the agent options.
The main manifest of the agent JAR file must contain the attribute
Premain-Class
. The value of this attribute is the binary name of the agent class
 in the JAR file. The JVM starts the agent by loading the agent class and invoking its
premain
method. The method is invoked before the application
main
method is invoked. The
premain
method has one of two possible signatures.
 The JVM first attempts to invoke the following method on the agent class:
public static void premain(String agentArgs, Instrumentation inst)
If the agent class does not define this method then the JVM will attempt to invoke:
public static void premain(String agentArgs)
The agent is passed its agent options via the
agentArgs
parameter.
 The agent options are passed as a single string, any additional parsing
 should be performed by the agent itself. In the first method, the
inst
parameter is an
Instrumentation
object that the agent can use to instrument
 code.
If the agent cannot be started, for example the agent class cannot be loaded,
 the agent class does not define a conformant
premain
method, or the
premain
method throws an uncaught exception or error, the JVM will abort before
 the application
main
method is invoked.
An implementation is not required to provide a way to start agents
 from the command-line interface. When it does, then it supports the
-javaagent
option as specified above. The
-javaagent
option
 may be used multiple times on the same command-line, thus starting multiple
 agents. The
premain
methods will be called in the order that the
 agents are specified on the command line. More than one agent may use the
 same
<jarpath>
.
The agent class may also have an
agentmain
method for use when the agent
 is started after in a running JVM (see below). When the agent is started using a
 command-line option, the
agentmain
method is not invoked.
Starting an agent in a running JVM
An implementation may provide a mechanism to start agents in a running JVM (meaning
 after JVM startup). The details as to how this is initiated are implementation specific
 but typically the application has already started, and its
main
method has
 already been invoked. Where an implementation supports starting an agent in a running
 JVM, the following applies:
The agent class must be packaged into an agent JAR file. The main manifest
   of the agent JAR file must contain the attribute
Agent-Class
. The value of
   this attribute is the binary name of the agent class in the JAR file.
The agent class must define a public static
agentmain
method.
The JVM prints a warning on the standard error stream for each agent that it
   attempts to start in a running JVM. If an agent was previously started (at JVM
   startup, or started in a running JVM), then it is implementation specific as to whether
   a warning is printed when attempting to start the same agent a second or subsequent
   time. Warnings can be disabled by means of an implementation-specific command line
   option.
Implementation Note:
For the HotSpot VM, the JVM option
-XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading
is used to opt-in to allow dynamic loading of
   agents into a running JVM. This option suppresses the warning to standard error when
   starting an agent in a running JVM.
The JVM starts the agent by loading the agent class and invoking its
agentmain
method. The
agentmain
method has one of two possible signatures.
 The JVM first attempts to invoke the following method on the agent class:
public static void agentmain(String agentArgs, Instrumentation inst)
If the agent class does not define this method then the JVM will
 attempt to invoke:
public static void agentmain(String agentArgs)
The agent is passed its agent options via the
agentArgs
parameter.
 The agent options are passed as a single string, any additional parsing
 should be performed by the agent itself. In the first method, the
inst
parameter is an
Instrumentation
object that the agent can use to instrument
 code.
The
agentmain
method should do any necessary initialization
 required to start the agent. When startup is complete the method should
 return. If the agent cannot be started (for example, because the agent class
 cannot be loaded, or because the agent class does not have a conformant
agentmain
method), the JVM will not abort. If the
agentmain
method throws an uncaught exception it will be ignored (but may be logged
 by the JVM for troubleshooting purposes).
The agent class may also have a
premain
method for use when the agent
 is started using a command-line option. The
premain
method is not invoked
 when the agent is started in a running JVM.
Loading agent classes and the modules/classes available to the agent
 class
Classes loaded from the agent JAR file are loaded by the
system class loader
and are
 members of the system class loader's
unnamed module
. The system class loader typically defines the class containing
 the application
main
method too.
The classes visible to the agent class are the classes visible to the system
 class loader and minimally include:
The classes in packages exported by the modules in the
boot layer
. Whether the boot layer contains all platform
   modules or not will depend on the initial module or how the application was
   started.
The classes that can be defined by the system class loader (typically
   the class path) to be members of its unnamed module.
Any classes that the agent arranges to be defined by the bootstrap
   class loader to be members of its unnamed module.
If agent classes need to link to classes in platform (or other) modules
 that are not in the boot layer then the application may need to be started in
 a way that ensures that these modules are in the boot layer. In the JDK
 implementation for example, the
--add-modules
command line option can
 be used to add modules to the set of root modules to resolve at startup.
Supporting classes that the agent arranges to be loaded by the bootstrap
 class loader (by means of
appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch
or the
Boot-Class-Path
attribute
 specified below), must link only to classes defined to the bootstrap class loader.
 There is no guarantee that all platform classes can be defined by the boot
 class loader.
If a custom system class loader is configured (by means of the system property
java.system.class.loader
as specified in the
getSystemClassLoader
method) then it must
 define the
appendToClassPathForInstrumentation
method as specified in
appendToSystemClassLoaderSearch
.
 In other words, a custom system class loader must support the mechanism to
 add an agent JAR file to the system class loader search.
JAR File Manifest Attributes
The following attributes in the main section of the application or agent
 JAR file manifest are defined for Java agents:
Launcher-Agent-Class
If an implementation supports a mechanism to start an application in an
 executable JAR file, then this attribute, if present, specifies the binary name
 of the agent class that is packaged with the application.
 The agent is started by invoking the agent class
agentmain
method. It is
 invoked before the application
main
method is invoked.
Premain-Class
If an agent JAR is specified at JVM launch time, this attribute specifies
 the binary name of the agent class in the JAR file.
 The agent is started by invoking the agent class
premain
method. It is
 invoked before the application
main
method is invoked.
 If the attribute is not present the JVM will abort.
Agent-Class
If an implementation supports a mechanism to start an agent sometime after
 the JVM has started, then this attribute specifies the binary name of the Java
 agent class in the agent JAR file.
 The agent is started by invoking the agent class
agentmain
method.
 This attribute is required; if not present the agent will not be started.
Boot-Class-Path
A list of paths to be searched by the bootstrap class loader. Paths
 represent directories or libraries (commonly referred to as JAR or zip
 libraries on many platforms). These paths are searched by the bootstrap class
 loader after the platform specific mechanisms of locating a class have failed.
 Paths are searched in the order listed. Paths in the list are separated by one
 or more spaces. A path takes the syntax of the path component of a hierarchical
 URI. The path is absolute if it begins with a slash character ('/'), otherwise
 it is relative. A relative path is resolved against the absolute path of the
 agent JAR file. Malformed and non-existent paths are ignored. When an agent is
 started sometime after the JVM has started then paths that do not represent a
 JAR file are ignored. This attribute is optional.
Can-Redefine-Classes
Boolean (
true
or
false
, case irrelevant). Is the ability
 to redefine classes needed by this agent. Values other than
true
are
 considered
false
. This attribute is optional, the default is
false
.
Can-Retransform-Classes
Boolean (
true
or
false
, case irrelevant). Is the ability
 to retransform classes needed by this agent. Values other than
true
are considered
false
. This attribute is optional, the default is
false
.
Can-Set-Native-Method-Prefix
Boolean (
true
or
false
, case irrelevant). Is the ability
 to set native method prefix needed by this agent. Values other than
true
are considered
false
. This attribute is optional, the default
 is
false
.
An agent JAR file may have both the
Premain-Class
and
Agent-Class
attributes present in the manifest. When the agent is started
 on the command-line using the
-javaagent
option then the
Premain-Class
attribute specifies the binary name of the agent class and the
Agent-Class
attribute is ignored. Similarly, if the agent is started sometime
 after the JVM has started, then the
Agent-Class
attribute specifies
 the binary name of the agent class (the value of
Premain-Class
attribute is
 ignored).
Instrumenting code in modules
As an aid to agents that deploy supporting classes on the search path of
 the bootstrap class loader, or the search path of the class loader that loads
 the main agent class, the Java virtual machine arranges for the module of
 transformed classes to read the unnamed module of both class loaders.
