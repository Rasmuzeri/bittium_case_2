public class
Event
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
Deprecated.
It is recommended that
AWTEvent
and its subclasses be
             used instead
NOTE:
The
Event
class is obsolete and is
 available only for backwards compatibility.  It has been replaced
 by the
AWTEvent
class and its subclasses.
Event
is a platform-independent class that
 encapsulates events from the platform's Graphical User
 Interface in the Java 1.0 event model. In Java 1.1
 and later versions, the
Event
class is maintained
 only for backwards compatibility. The information in this
 class description is provided to assist programmers in
 converting Java 1.0 programs to the new event model.
In the Java 1.0 event model, an event contains an
id
field
 that indicates what type of event it is and which other
Event
variables are relevant for the event.
For keyboard events,
key
contains a value indicating which key was activated, and
modifiers
contains the
 modifiers for that event.  For the KEY_PRESS and KEY_RELEASE
 event ids, the value of
key
is the unicode
 character code for the key. For KEY_ACTION and
 KEY_ACTION_RELEASE, the value of
key
is
 one of the defined action-key identifiers in the
Event
class (
PGUP
,
PGDN
,
F1
,
F2
, etc).

translate
(int dx,
 int dy)
Deprecated.
NOTE:
The
Event
class is obsolete and is
 available only for backwards compatibility.  It has been replaced
 by the
AWTEvent
class and its subclasses.
Translates this event so that its
x
and
y
coordinates are increased by
dx
and
dy
,
 respectively.
This method translates an event relative to the given component.
 This involves, at a minimum, translating the coordinates into the
 local coordinate system of the given component. It may also involve
 translating a region in the case of an expose event.
Parameters:
dx
- the distance to translate the
x
coordinate.
dy
- the distance to translate the
y
coordinate.
