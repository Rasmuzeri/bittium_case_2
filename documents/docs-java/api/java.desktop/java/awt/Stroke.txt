Interface Stroke
All Known Implementing Classes:
BasicStroke
public interface
Stroke
The
Stroke
interface allows a
Graphics2D
object to obtain a
Shape
that is the
 decorated outline, or stylistic representation of the outline,
 of the specified
Shape
.
 Stroking a
Shape
is like tracing its outline with a
 marking pen of the appropriate size and shape.
 The area where the pen would place ink is the area enclosed by the
 outline
Shape
.
The methods of the
Graphics2D
interface that use the
 outline
Shape
returned by a
Stroke
object
 include
draw
and any other methods that are
 implemented in terms of that method, such as
drawLine
,
drawRect
,
drawRoundRect
,
drawOval
,
drawArc
,
drawPolyline
,
 and
drawPolygon
.
The objects of the classes implementing
Stroke
must be read-only because
Graphics2D
does not
 clone these objects either when they are set as an attribute
 with the
setStroke
method or when the
Graphics2D
object is itself cloned.
 If a
Stroke
object is modified after it is set in
 the
Graphics2D
context then the behavior
 of subsequent rendering would be undefined.
