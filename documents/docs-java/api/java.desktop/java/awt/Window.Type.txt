 A window type defines the generic visual appearance and behavior of a
 top-level window. For example, the type may affect the kind of
 decorations of a decorated
Frame
or
Dialog
instance.
Some platforms may not fully support a certain window type. Depending on
 the level of support, some properties of the window type may be
 disobeyed.

Enum Constant Details
NORMAL
public static final
Window.Type
NORMAL
Represents a
normal
window.

 This is the default type for objects of the
Window
class or
 its descendants. Use this type for regular top-level windows.
UTILITY
public static final
Window.Type
UTILITY
Represents a
utility
window.

 A utility window is usually a small window such as a toolbar or a
 palette. The native system may render the window with smaller
 title-bar if the window is either a
Frame
or a
Dialog
object, and if it has its decorations enabled.
POPUP
public static final
Window.Type
POPUP
Represents a
popup
window.

 A popup window is a temporary window such as a drop-down menu or a
 tooltip. On some platforms, windows of that type may be forcibly
 made undecorated even if they are instances of the
Frame
or
Dialog
class, and have decorations enabled.
