KeyEventDispatcher
A KeyEventDispatcher cooperates with the current KeyboardFocusManager in the
 targeting and dispatching of all KeyEvents. KeyEventDispatchers registered
 with the current KeyboardFocusManager will receive KeyEvents before they are
 dispatched to their targets, allowing each KeyEventDispatcher to retarget
 the event, consume it, dispatch the event itself, or make other changes.
Note that KeyboardFocusManager itself implements KeyEventDispatcher. By
 default, the current KeyboardFocusManager will be the sink for all KeyEvents
 not dispatched by the registered KeyEventDispatchers. The current
 KeyboardFocusManager cannot be completely deregistered as a
 KeyEventDispatcher. However, if a KeyEventDispatcher reports that it
 dispatched the KeyEvent, regardless of whether it actually did so, the
 KeyboardFocusManager will take no further action with regard to the
 KeyEvent. (While it is possible for client code to register the current
 KeyboardFocusManager as a KeyEventDispatcher one or more times, this is
 usually unnecessary and not recommended.)

Method Details
dispatchKeyEvent
boolean
dispatchKeyEvent
(
KeyEvent
e)
This method is called by the current KeyboardFocusManager requesting
 that this KeyEventDispatcher dispatch the specified event on its behalf.
 This KeyEventDispatcher is free to retarget the event, consume it,
 dispatch it itself, or make other changes. This capability is typically
 used to deliver KeyEvents to Components other than the focus owner. This
 can be useful when navigating children of non-focusable Windows in an
 accessible environment, for example. Note that if a KeyEventDispatcher
 dispatches the KeyEvent itself, it must use
redispatchEvent
to prevent the current KeyboardFocusManager from recursively requesting
 that this KeyEventDispatcher dispatch the event again.
If an implementation of this method returns
false
, then
 the KeyEvent is passed to the next KeyEventDispatcher in the chain,
 ending with the current KeyboardFocusManager. If an implementation
 returns
true
, the KeyEvent is assumed to have been
 dispatched (although this need not be the case), and the current
 KeyboardFocusManager will take no further action with regard to the
 KeyEvent. In such a case,
KeyboardFocusManager.dispatchEvent
should return
true
as well. If an implementation consumes the KeyEvent,
 but returns
false
, the consumed event will still be passed
 to the next KeyEventDispatcher in the chain. It is important for
 developers to check whether the KeyEvent has been consumed before
 dispatching it to a target. By default, the current KeyboardFocusManager
 will not dispatch a consumed KeyEvent.
Parameters:
e
- the KeyEvent to dispatch
Returns:
true
if the KeyboardFocusManager should take no
         further action with regard to the KeyEvent;
false
otherwise
