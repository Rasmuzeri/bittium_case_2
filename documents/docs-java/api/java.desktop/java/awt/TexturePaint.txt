Class TexturePaint
java.lang.Object
java.awt.TexturePaint
All Implemented Interfaces:
Paint
,
Transparency
public class
TexturePaint
extends
Object
implements
Paint
The
TexturePaint
class provides a way to fill a
Shape
with a texture that is specified as
 a
BufferedImage
. The size of the
BufferedImage
object should be small because the
BufferedImage
data
 is copied by the
TexturePaint
object.
 At construction time, the texture is anchored to the upper
 left corner of a
Rectangle2D
that is
 specified in user space.  Texture is computed for
 locations in the device space by conceptually replicating the
 specified
Rectangle2D
infinitely in all directions
 in user space and mapping the
BufferedImage
to each
 replicated
Rectangle2D
.

- the
BufferedImage
object with the texture
 used for painting
anchor
- the
Rectangle2D
in user space used to
 anchor and replicate the texture

public
PaintContext
createContext
(
ColorModel
cm,
Rectangle
deviceBounds,
Rectangle2D
userBounds,
AffineTransform
xform,
RenderingHints
hints)
Creates and returns a
PaintContext
used to
 generate a tiled image pattern.
 See the
specification
of the
 method in the
Paint
interface for information
 on null parameter handling.
Specified by:
createContext
in interface
Paint
Parameters:
cm
- the preferred
ColorModel
which represents the most convenient
           format for the caller to receive the pixel data, or
null
if there is no preference.
deviceBounds
- the device space bounding box
                     of the graphics primitive being rendered.
userBounds
- the user space bounding box
                   of the graphics primitive being rendered.
xform
- the
AffineTransform
from user
              space into device space.
hints
- the set of hints that the context object can use to
              choose between rendering alternatives.
Returns:
the
PaintContext
for
         generating color patterns.
