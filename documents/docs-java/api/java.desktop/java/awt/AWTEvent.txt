public abstract class
AWTEvent
extends
EventObject
The root event class for all AWT events.
 This class and its subclasses supersede the original
 java.awt.Event class.
 Subclasses of this root AWTEvent class defined outside of the
 java.awt.event package should define event ID values greater than
 the value defined by RESERVED_ID_MAX.
The event masks defined in this class are needed by Component subclasses
 which are using Component.enableEvents() to select for event types not
 selected by registered listeners. If a listener is registered on a
 component, the appropriate event mask is already set internally by the
 component.
The masks are also used to specify to which types of events an
 AWTEventListener should listen. The masks are bitwise-ORed together
 and passed to Toolkit.addAWTEventListener.
Since:
1.1

Controls whether or not the event is sent back down to the peer once the
 source has processed it - false means it's sent to the peer; true means
 it's not. Semantic events always have a 'true' value since they were
 generated by the peer in response to a low-level event.
