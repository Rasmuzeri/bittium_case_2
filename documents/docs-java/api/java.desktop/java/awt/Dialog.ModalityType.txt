Modal dialogs block all input to some top-level windows.
 Whether a particular window is blocked depends on dialog's type
 of modality; this is called the "scope of blocking". The
ModalityType
enum specifies modal types and their
 associated scopes.
Since:
1.6

Enum Constant Details
MODELESS
public static final
Dialog.ModalityType
MODELESS
MODELESS
dialog doesn't block any top-level windows.
DOCUMENT_MODAL
public static final
Dialog.ModalityType
DOCUMENT_MODAL
A
DOCUMENT_MODAL
dialog blocks input to all top-level windows
 from the same document except those from its own child hierarchy.
 A document is a top-level window without an owner. It may contain child
 windows that, together with the top-level window are treated as a single
 solid document. Since every top-level window must belong to some
 document, its root can be found as the top-nearest window without an owner.
APPLICATION_MODAL
public static final
Dialog.ModalityType
APPLICATION_MODAL
An
APPLICATION_MODAL
dialog blocks all top-level windows
 from the same Java application except those from its own child hierarchy.
 If there are several applets launched in a browser, they can be
 treated either as separate applications or a single one. This behavior
 is implementation-dependent.
TOOLKIT_MODAL
public static final
Dialog.ModalityType
TOOLKIT_MODAL
A
TOOLKIT_MODAL
dialog blocks all top-level windows run
 from the same toolkit except those from its own child hierarchy. If there
 are several applets launched in a browser, all of them run with the same
 toolkit; thus, a toolkit-modal dialog displayed by an applet may affect
 other applets and all windows of the browser instance which embeds the
 Java runtime environment for this toolkit.
 Special
AWTPermission
"toolkitModality" must be granted to use
 toolkit-modal dialogs. If a
TOOLKIT_MODAL
dialog is being created
 and this permission is not granted, a
SecurityException
will be
 thrown, and no dialog will be created. If a modality type is being changed
 to
TOOLKIT_MODAL
and this permission is not granted, a
SecurityException
will be thrown, and the modality type will
 be left unchanged.
