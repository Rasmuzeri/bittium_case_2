java.awt.geom
Class GeneralPath
java.lang.Object
java.awt.geom.Path2D
java.awt.geom.Path2D.Float
java.awt.geom.GeneralPath
All Implemented Interfaces:
Shape
,
Serializable
,
Cloneable
public final class
GeneralPath
extends
Path2D.Float
The
GeneralPath
class represents a geometric path
 constructed from straight lines, and quadratic and cubic
 (Bézier) curves.  It can contain multiple subpaths.
GeneralPath
is a legacy final class which exactly
 implements the behavior of its superclass
Path2D.Float
.
 Together with
Path2D.Double
, the
Path2D
classes
 provide full implementations of a general geometric path that
 support all of the functionality of the
Shape
and
PathIterator
interfaces with the ability to explicitly
 select different levels of internal coordinate precision.
Use
Path2D.Float
(or this legacy
GeneralPath
subclass) when dealing with data that can be represented
 and used with floating point precision.  Use
Path2D.Double
for data that requires the accuracy or range of double precision.

1.2

Description
GeneralPath
()
Constructs a new empty single precision

GeneralPath
(int rule)
Constructs a new
GeneralPath
object with the specified
 winding rule to control operations that require the interior of the
 path to be defined.
GeneralPath

Constructs a new
GeneralPath
object with the specified
 winding rule and the specified initial capacity to store path
 coordinates.
GeneralPath
(

Constructs a new
GeneralPath
object from an arbitrary
Shape
object.

Constructor Details
GeneralPath
public
GeneralPath
()
Constructs a new empty single precision
GeneralPath
object
 with a default winding rule of
Path2D.WIND_NON_ZERO
.
Since:
1.2
GeneralPath
public
GeneralPath
(int rule)
Constructs a new
GeneralPath
object with the specified
 winding rule to control operations that require the interior of the
 path to be defined.
Parameters:
rule
- the winding rule
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
rule
is not either
Path2D.WIND_EVEN_ODD
or
Path2D.WIND_NON_ZERO
Since:
1.2
See Also:
Path2D.WIND_EVEN_ODD
Path2D.WIND_NON_ZERO
GeneralPath
public
GeneralPath
(int rule,
 int initialCapacity)
Constructs a new
GeneralPath
object with the specified
 winding rule and the specified initial capacity to store path
 coordinates.
 This number is an initial guess as to how many path segments
 will be added to the path, but the storage is expanded as
 needed to store whatever path segments are added.
Parameters:
rule
- the winding rule
initialCapacity
- the estimate for the number of path segments
                        in the path
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
rule
is not either
Path2D.WIND_EVEN_ODD
or
Path2D.WIND_NON_ZERO
NegativeArraySizeException
- if
initialCapacity
is
         negative
Since:
1.2
See Also:
Path2D.WIND_EVEN_ODD
Path2D.WIND_NON_ZERO
GeneralPath
public
GeneralPath
(
Shape
s)
Constructs a new
GeneralPath
object from an arbitrary
Shape
object.
 All of the initial geometry and the winding rule for this path are
 taken from the specified
Shape
object.
Parameters:
s
- the specified
Shape
object
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
s
is
null
Since:
1.2
