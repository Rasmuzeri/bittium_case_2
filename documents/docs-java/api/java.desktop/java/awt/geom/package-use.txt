Class
Description
AffineTransform
The
AffineTransform
class represents a 2D affine transform
 that performs a linear mapping from 2D coordinates to other 2D
 coordinates that preserves the "straightness" and
 "parallelness" of lines.
Dimension2D
The
Dimension2D
class is to encapsulate a width
 and a height dimension.
PathIterator
The
PathIterator
interface provides the mechanism
 for objects that implement the
Shape
interface to return the geometry of their boundary by allowing
 a caller to retrieve the path of that boundary a segment at a
 time.
Point2D
The
Point2D
class defines a point representing a location
 in
(x,y)
coordinate space.
Rectangle2D
The
Rectangle2D
class describes a rectangle
 defined by a location
(x,y)
and dimension
(w x h)
.
RectangularShape
RectangularShape
is the base class for a number of
Shape
objects whose geometry is defined by a rectangular frame.

Arc2D
Arc2D
is the abstract superclass for all objects that
 store a 2D arc defined by a framing rectangle,
 start angle, angular extent (length of the arc), and a closure type
 (
OPEN
,
CHORD
, or
PIE
).
Area
An
Area
object stores and manipulates a
 resolution-independent description of an enclosed area of
 2-dimensional space.
CubicCurve2D
The
CubicCurve2D
class defines a cubic parametric curve
 segment in
(x,y)
coordinate space.
Dimension2D
The
Dimension2D
class is to encapsulate a width
 and a height dimension.
Ellipse2D
The
Ellipse2D
class describes an ellipse that is defined
 by a framing rectangle.
Line2D
This
Line2D
represents a line segment in
(x,y)
coordinate space.
NoninvertibleTransformException
The
NoninvertibleTransformException
class represents
 an exception that is thrown if an operation is performed requiring
 the inverse of an
AffineTransform
object but the
AffineTransform
is in a non-invertible state.
Path2D
The
Path2D
class provides a simple, yet flexible
 shape which represents an arbitrary geometric path.
Path2D.Float
The
Float
class defines a geometric path with
 coordinates stored in single precision floating point.
PathIterator
The
PathIterator
interface provides the mechanism
 for objects that implement the
Shape
interface to return the geometry of their boundary by allowing
 a caller to retrieve the path of that boundary a segment at a
 time.
Point2D
The
Point2D
class defines a point representing a location
 in
(x,y)
coordinate space.
QuadCurve2D
The
QuadCurve2D
class defines a quadratic parametric curve
 segment in
(x,y)
coordinate space.
Rectangle2D
The
Rectangle2D
class describes a rectangle
 defined by a location
(x,y)
and dimension
(w x h)
.
RectangularShape

RoundRectangle2D
The
RoundRectangle2D
class defines a rectangle with
 rounded corners defined by a location
(x,y)
, a
 dimension
(w x h)
, and the width and height of an arc
 with which to round the corners.
