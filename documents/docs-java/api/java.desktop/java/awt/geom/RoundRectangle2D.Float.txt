Parameters:
rr
- the specified
RoundRectangle2D
Since:
1.2
getBounds2D
public
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D
()
Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of
 the
Shape
than the
getBounds
method.
 Note that there is no guarantee that the returned
Rectangle2D
is the smallest bounding box that encloses
 the
Shape
, only that the
Shape
lies
 entirely within the indicated
Rectangle2D
.  The
 bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that
 returned by the
getBounds
method and never fails due
 to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of
 the
Rectangle2D
that uses double precision values to
 store the dimensions.
Note that the
definition of insideness
can lead to situations where points
 on the defining outline of the
shape
may not be considered
 contained in the returned
bounds
object, but only in cases
 where those points are also not considered contained in the original
shape
.
If a
point
is inside the
shape
according to the
contains(point)
method, then it must
 be inside the returned
Rectangle2D
bounds object according
 to the
contains(point)
method of the
bounds
. Specifically:
shape.contains(p)
requires
bounds.contains(p)
If a
point
is not inside the
shape
, then it might
 still be contained in the
bounds
object:
bounds.contains(p)
does not imply
shape.contains(p)
Specified by:
getBounds2D
in interface
Shape
Returns:
an instance of
Rectangle2D
that is a
                 high-precision bounding box of the
Shape
.

1.2
