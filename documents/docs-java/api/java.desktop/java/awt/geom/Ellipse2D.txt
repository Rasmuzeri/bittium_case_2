public abstract class
Ellipse2D
extends
RectangularShape
The
Ellipse2D
class describes an ellipse that is defined
 by a framing rectangle.
This class is only the abstract superclass for all objects which
 store a 2D ellipse.
 The actual storage representation of the coordinates is left to
 the subclass.

Ellipse2D
()
This is an abstract class that cannot be instantiated directly.
 Type-specific implementation subclasses are available for
 instantiation and provide a number of formats for storing
 the information necessary to satisfy the various accessor
 methods below.

Method Details
contains
public
boolean
contains
(double x,
 double y)
Tests if the specified coordinates are inside the boundary of the
Shape
, as described by the
definition of insideness
.
Parameters:
x
- the specified X coordinate to be tested
y
- the specified Y coordinate to be tested
Returns:
true
if the specified coordinates are inside
         the
Shape
boundary;
false
otherwise.
Since:
1.2
intersects
public
boolean
intersects
(double x,
 double y,
 double w,
 double h)
Tests if the interior of the
Shape
intersects the
 interior of a specified rectangular area.
 The rectangular area is considered to intersect the
Shape
if any point is contained in both the interior of the
Shape
and the specified rectangular area.
The
Shape.intersects()
method allows a
Shape
implementation to conservatively return
true
when:
there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the
Shape
intersect, but
the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
 are prohibitively expensive.
This means that for some
Shapes
this method might
 return
true
even though the rectangular area does not
 intersect the
Shape
.
 The
Area
class performs
 more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most
Shape
objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
 answer is required.
Parameters:
x
- the X coordinate of the upper-left corner
          of the specified rectangular area
y
- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
          of the specified rectangular area
w
- the width of the specified rectangular area
h
- the height of the specified rectangular area
Returns:
true
if the interior of the
Shape
and
          the interior of the rectangular area intersect, or are
          both highly likely to intersect and intersection calculations
          would be too expensive to perform;
false
otherwise.

1.2

Area
contains
public
boolean
contains
(double x,
 double y,
 double w,
 double h)
Tests if the interior of the
Shape
entirely contains
 the specified rectangular area.  All coordinates that lie inside
 the rectangular area must lie within the
Shape
for the
 entire rectangular area to be considered contained within the
Shape
.
The
Shape.contains()
method allows a
Shape
implementation to conservatively return
false
when:
the
intersect
method returns
true
and
the calculations to determine whether or not the
Shape
entirely contains the rectangular area are
 prohibitively expensive.
This means that for some
Shapes
this method might
 return
false
even though the
Shape
contains
 the rectangular area.
 The
Area
class performs
 more accurate geometric computations than most
Shape
objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
 answer is required.
Parameters:
x
- the X coordinate of the upper-left corner
          of the specified rectangular area
y
- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
          of the specified rectangular area
w
- the width of the specified rectangular area
h
- the height of the specified rectangular area
Returns:
true
if the interior of the
Shape
entirely contains the specified rectangular area;
false
otherwise or, if the
Shape
contains the rectangular area and the
intersects
method returns
true
and the containment calculations would be too expensive to
          perform.

getPathIterator
public
PathIterator
getPathIterator
(
AffineTransform
at)
Returns an iteration object that defines the boundary of this
Ellipse2D
.
 The iterator for this class is multi-threaded safe, which means
 that this
Ellipse2D
class guarantees that
 modifications to the geometry of this
Ellipse2D
object do not affect any iterations of that geometry that
 are already in process.
Parameters:
at
- an optional
AffineTransform
to be applied to
 the coordinates as they are returned in the iteration, or
null
if untransformed coordinates are desired
Returns:
the
PathIterator
object that returns the
          geometry of the outline of this
Ellipse2D
,
          one segment at a time.
Since:

hashCode
public

hashCode
()
Returns the hashcode for this
Ellipse2D

Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
the hashcode for this
Ellipse2D
.

See Also:
Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Determines whether or not the specified
Object
is
 equal to this
Ellipse2D
.  The specified
Object
is equal to this
Ellipse2D
if it is an instance of
Ellipse2D
and if its
 location and size are the same as this
Ellipse2D
.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- an
Object
to be compared with this
Ellipse2D
.
Returns:
true
if
obj
is an instance
          of
Ellipse2D
and has the same values;
false
otherwise.
