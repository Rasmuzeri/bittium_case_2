Canvas
or
Window
or
Applet
.
Parameters:
numBuffers
- the number of buffers
caps
- the capabilities of the buffers
Throws:

- if the capabilities supplied could not be
 supported or met
ClassCastException
- if the component is not a canvas or
 window.
IllegalStateException
- if the component has no peer
IllegalArgumentException
- if
numBuffers
is less than two,
 or if

Method Details
createBuffers
protected
void
createBuffers
(int numBuffers,
BufferCapabilities

throws
AWTException
Creates one or more complex, flipping buffers with the given
 capabilities.
Parameters:
numBuffers
- number of buffers to create; must be greater than
 one
caps
- the capabilities of the buffers.
BufferCapabilities.isPageFlipping
must be
true
.
Throws:
AWTException
- if the capabilities supplied could not be
 supported or met
IllegalStateException
- if the component has no peer
IllegalArgumentException
- if numBuffers is less than two,
 or if
BufferCapabilities.isPageFlipping
is not
true
.

BufferCapabilities.isPageFlipping()
getBackBuffer
protected
Image
getBackBuffer
()
Provides direct access to the back buffer as an image.
Returns:
the back buffer as an image
Throws:
IllegalStateException
- if the buffers have not yet
 been created
flip
protected
void
flip
(
BufferCapabilities.FlipContents
flipAction)
Flipping moves the contents of the back buffer to the front buffer,
 either by copying or by moving the video pointer.
Parameters:
flipAction
- an integer value describing the flipping action
 for the contents of the back buffer.  This should be one of the
 values of the
BufferCapabilities.FlipContents
property.
Throws:
IllegalStateException
- if the buffers have not yet
 been created

getCapabilities
()
Description copied from class:
BufferStrategy
Returns the
BufferCapabilities
for this
BufferStrategy
.
Specified by:
getCapabilities
in class
BufferStrategy
Returns:
the buffering capabilities of this strategy
getDrawGraphics
public
Graphics
getDrawGraphics
()
Description copied from class:
BufferStrategy
Creates a graphics context for the drawing buffer.  This method may not
 be synchronized for performance reasons; use of this method by multiple
 threads should be handled at the application level.  Disposal of the
 graphics object obtained must be handled by the application.
Specified by:
getDrawGraphics
in class
BufferStrategy
Returns:
the graphics on the drawing buffer.  This method may not
 be synchronized for performance reasons; use of this method by multiple
 threads should be handled at the application level.  Disposal of the
 graphics object must be handled by the application.
revalidate
protected
void
revalidate
()
Restore the drawing buffer if it has been lost
contentsLost
public
boolean
contentsLost
()
Description copied from class:
BufferStrategy
Returns whether the drawing buffer was lost since the last call to
getDrawGraphics
.  Since the buffers in a buffer strategy
 are usually type
VolatileImage
, they may become lost.
 For a discussion on lost buffers, see
VolatileImage
.
Specified by:
contentsLost
in class
BufferStrategy
Returns:
whether the drawing buffer was lost since the last call to
getDrawGraphics
See Also:
VolatileImage
contentsRestored
public
boolean
contentsRestored
()
Description copied from class:
BufferStrategy
Returns whether the drawing buffer was recently restored from a lost
 state and reinitialized to the default background color (white).
 Since the buffers in a buffer strategy are usually type
VolatileImage
, they may become lost.  If a surface has
 been recently restored from a lost state since the last call to
getDrawGraphics
, it may require repainting.
 For a discussion on lost buffers, see
VolatileImage
.
Specified by:
contentsRestored
in class
BufferStrategy
Returns:
whether the drawing buffer was recently restored from a lost
 state and reinitialized to the default background color (white)

void
show
()
Makes the next available buffer visible by either blitting or
 flipping.
Specified by:
show
in class
BufferStrategy
dispose
public
void
dispose
()
Releases system resources currently consumed by this
BufferStrategy
and
 removes it from the associated Component.  After invoking this
 method,
getBufferStrategy
will return null.  Trying
 to use a
BufferStrategy
after it has been disposed will
 result in undefined behavior.
Overrides:
