BltBufferStrategy
(int numBuffers,
BufferCapabilities
caps)
Creates a new blt buffer strategy around a component
Parameters:
numBuffers
- number of buffers to create, including the
 front buffer
caps
- the capabilities of the buffers
Method Details
dispose
public
void
dispose
()
Releases system resources currently consumed by this
BufferStrategy
and
 removes it from the associated Component.  After invoking this
 method,
getBufferStrategy
will return null.  Trying
 to use a
BufferStrategy
after it has been disposed will
 result in undefined behavior.
Overrides:
dispose
in class
BufferStrategy

void
createBackBuffers
(int numBuffers)
Creates the back buffers
Parameters:
numBuffers
- the number of buffers to create
getCapabilities
public
BufferCapabilities
getCapabilities
()
Description copied from class:
BufferStrategy
Returns the
BufferCapabilities
for this
BufferStrategy
.
Specified by:
getCapabilities
in class
BufferStrategy
Returns:
the buffering capabilities of this strategy
getDrawGraphics
public
Graphics
getDrawGraphics
()
Description copied from class:
BufferStrategy
Creates a graphics context for the drawing buffer.  This method may not
 be synchronized for performance reasons; use of this method by multiple
 threads should be handled at the application level.  Disposal of the
 graphics object obtained must be handled by the application.
Specified by:
getDrawGraphics
in class
BufferStrategy
Returns:
the draw graphics
show
public
void
show
()
Makes the next available buffer visible.
Specified by:
show
in class
BufferStrategy
revalidate
protected
void
revalidate
()
Restore the drawing buffer if it has been lost
contentsLost
public
boolean
contentsLost
()
Description copied from class:
BufferStrategy
Returns whether the drawing buffer was lost since the last call to
getDrawGraphics
.  Since the buffers in a buffer strategy
 are usually type
VolatileImage
, they may become lost.
 For a discussion on lost buffers, see
VolatileImage
.
Specified by:
contentsLost
in class
BufferStrategy
Returns:
whether the drawing buffer was lost since the last call to
getDrawGraphics

contentsRestored
public
boolean
contentsRestored
()
Description copied from class:
BufferStrategy
Returns whether the drawing buffer was recently restored from a lost
 state and reinitialized to the default background color (white).
 Since the buffers in a buffer strategy are usually type
VolatileImage
, they may become lost.  If a surface has
 been recently restored from a lost state since the last call to
getDrawGraphics
, it may require repainting.
 For a discussion on lost buffers, see
VolatileImage
.
Specified by:
contentsRestored
in class
BufferStrategy
Returns:
whether the drawing buffer was recently restored from a lost
 state and reinitialized to the default background color (white)
