Interface PaintContext
public interface
PaintContext
The
PaintContext
interface defines the encapsulated
 and optimized environment to generate color patterns in device
 space for fill or stroke operations on a
Graphics2D
.  The
PaintContext
provides
 the necessary colors for
Graphics2D
operations in the
 form of a
Raster
associated with a
ColorModel
.
 The
PaintContext
maintains state for a particular paint
 operation.  In a multi-threaded environment, several
 contexts can exist simultaneously for a single
Paint
object.

Method Details
dispose
void
dispose
()
Releases the resources allocated for the operation.
getColorModel
ColorModel
getColorModel
()
Returns the
ColorModel
of the output.  Note that
 this
ColorModel
might be different from the hint
 specified in the
createContext
method of
Paint
.  Not all
PaintContext
objects are
 capable of generating color patterns in an arbitrary
ColorModel
.
Returns:
the
ColorModel
of the output.
getRaster
Raster
getRaster

 int y,
 int w,
 int h)
Returns a
Raster
containing the colors generated for
 the graphics operation.
Parameters:
x
- the x coordinate of the area in device space
 for which colors are generated.
y
- the y coordinate of the area in device space
 for which colors are generated.
w
- the width of the area in device space
h
- the height of the area in device space
Returns:
a
Raster
representing the specified
 rectangular area and containing the colors generated for
 the graphics operation.
