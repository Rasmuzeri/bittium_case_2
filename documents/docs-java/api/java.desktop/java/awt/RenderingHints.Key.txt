Class RenderingHints.Key
java.lang.Object
java.awt.RenderingHints.Key
Enclosing class:
RenderingHints
public abstract static class
RenderingHints.Key
extends
Object
Defines the base type of all keys used along with the
RenderingHints
class to control various
 algorithm choices in the rendering and imaging pipelines.
 Instances of this class are immutable and unique which
 means that tests for matches can be made using the
==
operator instead of the more expensive
equals()
method.

Constructor Details
Key
protected
Key
(int privatekey)
Construct a key using the indicated private key.  Each
 subclass of Key maintains its own unique domain of integer
 keys.  No two objects with the same integer key and of the
 same specific subclass can be constructed.  An exception
 will be thrown if an attempt is made to construct another
 object of a given class with the same integer key as a
 pre-existing instance of that subclass of Key.
Parameters:
privatekey
- the specified key
Method Details
isCompatibleValue
public abstract
boolean
isCompatibleValue
(
Object
val)
Returns true if the specified object is a valid value
 for this Key.
Parameters:
val
- the
Object
to test for validity
Returns:
true
if
val
is valid;
false
otherwise.
intKey
protected final
int
intKey
()
Returns the private integer key that the subclass
 instantiated this Key with.
Returns:
the private integer key that the subclass
 instantiated this Key with.
hashCode
public final
int
hashCode
()
The hash code for all Key objects will be the same as the
 system identity code of the object as defined by the
 System.identityHashCode() method.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
a hash code value for this object.
See Also:
Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)
equals
public final
boolean
equals
(
Object
o)
The equals method for all Key objects will return the same
 result as the equality operator '=='.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
o
- the reference object with which to compare.
Returns:
true
if this object is the same as the obj
          argument;
false
otherwise.
