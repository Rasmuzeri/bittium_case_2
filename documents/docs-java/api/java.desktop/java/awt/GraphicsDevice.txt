Class GraphicsDevice
java.lang.Object
java.awt.GraphicsDevice
public abstract class
GraphicsDevice
extends
Object
The
GraphicsDevice
class describes the graphics devices
 that might be available in a particular graphics environment.  These
 include screen and printer devices. Note that there can be many screens
 and many printers in an instance of
GraphicsEnvironment
. Each
 graphics device has one or more
GraphicsConfiguration
objects
 associated with it.  These objects specify the different configurations
 in which the
GraphicsDevice
can be used.
In a multi-screen environment, the
GraphicsConfiguration
objects can be used to render components on multiple screens.  The
 following code sample demonstrates how to create a
JFrame
object for each
GraphicsConfiguration
on each screen
 device in the
GraphicsEnvironment
:
GraphicsEnvironment ge = GraphicsEnvironment.
   getLocalGraphicsEnvironment();
   GraphicsDevice[] gs = ge.getScreenDevices();
   for (int j = 0; j < gs.length; j++) {
      GraphicsDevice gd = gs[j];
      GraphicsConfiguration[] gc =
      gd.getConfigurations();
      for (int i=0; i < gc.length; i++) {
         JFrame f = new
         JFrame(gs[j].getDefaultConfiguration());
         Canvas c = new Canvas(gc[i]);
         Rectangle gcBounds = gc[i].getBounds();
         int xoffs = gcBounds.x;
         int yoffs = gcBounds.y;
         f.getContentPane().add(c);
         f.setLocation((i*50)+xoffs, (i*60)+yoffs);
         f.show();
      }
   }

public abstract
String
getIDstring
()
Returns the identification string associated with this
GraphicsDevice
.
A particular program might use more than one
GraphicsDevice
in a
GraphicsEnvironment
.
 This method returns a
String
identifying a
 particular
GraphicsDevice
in the local
GraphicsEnvironment
.  Although there is
 no public method to set this
String
, a programmer can
 use the
String
for debugging purposes.  Vendors of
 the Java Runtime Environment can
 format the return value of the
String
.  To determine
 how to interpret the value of the
String
, contact the
 vendor of your Java Runtime.  To find out who the vendor is, from
 your program, call the
getProperty
method of the
 System class with "java.vendor".
Returns:
a
String
that is the identification
 of this
GraphicsDevice
.
getConfigurations

isFullScreenSupported
public
boolean
isFullScreenSupported
()
Returns
true
if this
GraphicsDevice
supports full-screen exclusive mode.
 If a SecurityManager is installed, its
checkPermission
method will be called
 with
AWTPermission("fullScreenExclusive")
.
isFullScreenSupported
returns true only if
 that permission is granted.
Returns:
whether full-screen exclusive mode is available for
 this graphics device
Since:
1.4
See Also:
AWTPermission
setFullScreenWindow
public
void
setFullScreenWindow
(
Window
w)
Enter full-screen mode, or return to windowed mode.  The entered
 full-screen mode may be either exclusive or simulated.  Exclusive
 mode is only available if
isFullScreenSupported
returns
true
.
Exclusive mode implies:
Windows cannot overlap the full-screen window.  All other application
 windows will always appear beneath the full-screen window in the Z-order.
There can be only one full-screen window on a device at any time,
 so calling this method while there is an existing full-screen Window
 will cause the existing full-screen window to
 return to windowed mode.
Input method windows are disabled.  It is advisable to call
Component.enableInputMethods(false)
to make a component
 a non-client of the input method framework.
The simulated full-screen mode places and resizes the window to the maximum
 possible visible area of the screen. However, the native windowing system
 may modify the requested geometry-related data, so that the
Window
object
 is placed and sized in a way that corresponds closely to the desktop settings.
When entering full-screen mode, if the window to be used as a
 full-screen window is not visible, this method will make it visible.
 It will remain visible when returning to windowed mode.
When entering full-screen mode, all the translucency effects are reset for
 the window. Its shape is set to
null
, the opacity value is set to
 1.0f, and the background color alpha is set to 255 (completely opaque).
 These values are not restored when returning to windowed mode.
It is unspecified and platform-dependent how decorated windows operate
 in full-screen mode. For this reason, it is recommended to turn off
 the decorations in a
Frame
or
Dialog
object by using the
setUndecorated
method.
When returning to windowed mode from an exclusive full-screen window,
 any display changes made by calling
setDisplayMode
are
 automatically restored to their original state.
Parameters:
w
- a window to use as the full-screen window;
null
if returning to windowed mode.  Some platforms expect the
 fullscreen window to be a top-level component (i.e., a
Frame
);
 therefore it is preferable to use a
Frame
here rather than a
Window
.

getFullScreenWindow
public
Window
getFullScreenWindow
()
Returns the
Window
object representing the
 full-screen window if the device is in full-screen mode.
Returns:
the full-screen window, or
null
if the device is
 not in full-screen mode.

isDisplayChangeSupported
public
boolean
isDisplayChangeSupported
()
Returns
true
if this
GraphicsDevice
supports low-level display changes.
 On some platforms low-level display changes may only be allowed in
 full-screen exclusive mode (i.e., if
isFullScreenSupported()
returns
true
and the application has already entered
 full-screen mode using
setFullScreenWindow(java.awt.Window)
).
Returns:
whether low-level display changes are supported for this
 graphics device.

1.4
See Also:
isFullScreenSupported()
setDisplayMode(java.awt.DisplayMode)
setFullScreenWindow(java.awt.Window)
setDisplayMode
public
void
setDisplayMode
(
DisplayMode
dm)
Sets the display mode of this graphics device. This is only allowed
 if
isDisplayChangeSupported()
returns
true
and may
 require first entering full-screen exclusive mode using
setFullScreenWindow(java.awt.Window)
providing that full-screen exclusive mode is
 supported (i.e.,
isFullScreenSupported()
returns
true
).
The display mode must be one of the display modes returned by
getDisplayModes()
, with one exception: passing a display mode
 with
DisplayMode.REFRESH_RATE_UNKNOWN
refresh rate will result in
 selecting a display mode from the list of available display modes with
 matching width, height and bit depth.
 However, passing a display mode with
DisplayMode.BIT_DEPTH_MULTI
for bit depth is only allowed if such mode exists in the list returned by
getDisplayModes()
.
Example code:
Frame frame;
 DisplayMode newDisplayMode;
 GraphicsDevice gd;
 // create a Frame, select desired DisplayMode from the list of modes
 // returned by gd.getDisplayModes() ...

 if (gd.isFullScreenSupported()) {
     gd.setFullScreenWindow(frame);
 } else {
    // proceed in non-full-screen mode
    frame.setSize(...);
    frame.setLocation(...);
    frame.setVisible(true);
 }

 if (gd.isDisplayChangeSupported()) {
     gd.setDisplayMode(newDisplayMode);
 }
Parameters:
dm
- The new display mode of this graphics device.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the
DisplayMode
supplied is
null
, or is not available in the array returned
 by
getDisplayModes
UnsupportedOperationException
- if
isDisplayChangeSupported
returns
false

getAvailableAcceleratedMemory
public
int
getAvailableAcceleratedMemory
()
This method returns the number of bytes available in
 accelerated memory on this device.
 Some images are created or cached
 in accelerated memory on a first-come,
 first-served basis.  On some operating systems,
 this memory is a finite resource.  Calling this method
 and scheduling the creation and flushing of images carefully may
 enable applications to make the most efficient use of
 that finite resource.
Note that the number returned is a snapshot of how much
 memory is available; some images may still have problems
 being allocated into that memory.  For example, depending
 on operating system, driver, memory configuration, and
 thread situations, the full extent of the size reported
 may not be available for a given image.  There are further
 inquiry methods on the
ImageCapabilities
object
 associated with a VolatileImage that can be used to determine
 whether a particular VolatileImage has been created in accelerated
 memory.
Returns:
number of bytes available in accelerated memory.
 A negative return value indicates that the amount of accelerated memory
 on this GraphicsDevice is indeterminate.
Since:
1.4
