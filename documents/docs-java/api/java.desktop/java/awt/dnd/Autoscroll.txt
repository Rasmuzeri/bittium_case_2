Interface Autoscroll
public interface
Autoscroll
During DnD operations it is possible that a user may wish to drop the
 subject of the operation on a region of a scrollable GUI control that is
 not currently visible to the user.
In such situations it is desirable that the GUI control detect this
 and institute a scroll operation in order to make obscured region(s)
 visible to the user. This feature is known as autoscrolling.
If a GUI control is both an active
DropTarget
and is also scrollable, it
 can receive notifications of autoscrolling gestures by the user from
 the DnD system by implementing this interface.
An autoscrolling gesture is initiated by the user by keeping the drag
 cursor motionless with a border region of the
Component
,
 referred to as
 the "autoscrolling region", for a predefined period of time, this will
 result in repeated scroll requests to the
Component
until the drag
Cursor
resumes its motion.
