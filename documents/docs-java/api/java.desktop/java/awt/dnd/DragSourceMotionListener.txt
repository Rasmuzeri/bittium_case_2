Interface DragSourceMotionListener
All Superinterfaces:
EventListener
All Known Implementing Classes:
DragSourceAdapter
,
DragSourceContext
public interface
DragSourceMotionListener
extends
EventListener
A listener interface for receiving mouse motion events during a drag
 operation.
The class that is interested in processing mouse motion events during
 a drag operation either implements this interface or extends the abstract
DragSourceAdapter
class (overriding only the methods of
 interest).
Create a listener object using that class and then register it with
 a
DragSource
. Whenever the mouse moves during a drag
 operation initiated with this
DragSource
, that object's
dragMouseMoved
method is invoked, and the
DragSourceDragEvent
is passed to it.

1.4
