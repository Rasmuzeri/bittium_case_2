Class DragSourceEvent
java.lang.Object
java.util.EventObject
java.awt.dnd.DragSourceEvent
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
Direct Known Subclasses:
DragSourceDragEvent
,
DragSourceDropEvent
public class
DragSourceEvent
extends
EventObject
This class is the base class for
DragSourceDragEvent
and
DragSourceDropEvent
.
DragSourceEvent
s are generated whenever the drag enters, moves
 over, or exits a drop site, when the drop action changes, and when the drag
 ends. The location for the generated
DragSourceEvent
specifies
 the mouse cursor location in screen coordinates at the moment this event
 occurred.
In a multi-screen environment without a virtual device, the cursor location is
 specified in the coordinate system of the
initiator
GraphicsConfiguration
. The
initiator
GraphicsConfiguration
is the
GraphicsConfiguration
of the
Component
on which the drag gesture for the current drag
 operation was recognized. If the cursor location is outside the bounds of
 the initiator
GraphicsConfiguration
, the reported coordinates are
 clipped to fit within the bounds of that
GraphicsConfiguration
.
In a multi-screen environment with a virtual device, the location is specified
 in the corresponding virtual coordinate system. If the cursor location is
 outside the bounds of the virtual device the reported coordinates are
 clipped to fit within the bounds of the virtual device.
