ACTION_LINK
@Native
public static final
int
ACTION_LINK
An
int
representing a "link" action.

 The link verb is found in many, if not all native DnD platforms, and the
 actual interpretation of LINK semantics is both platform
 and application dependent. Broadly speaking, the
 semantic is "do not copy, or move the operand, but create a reference
 to it". Defining the meaning of "reference" is where ambiguity is
 introduced.

 The verb is provided for completeness, but its use is not recommended
 for DnD operations between logically distinct applications where
 misinterpretation of the operations semantics could lead to confusing
 results for the user.
