Package
Description
java.awt
Contains all of the classes for creating user interfaces and for painting
 graphics and images.

 two entities logically associated with presentation elements in the GUI.
Classes in
java.awt.dnd
used by
java.awt
Class
Description
DragGestureListener
The listener interface for receiving drag gesture events.
DragGestureRecognizer
The
DragGestureRecognizer
is an
 abstract base class for the specification
 of a platform-dependent listener that can be associated with a particular
Component
in order to
 identify platform-dependent drag initiating gestures.
DragSource
The
DragSource
is the entity responsible
 for the initiation of the Drag
 and Drop operation, and may be used in a number of scenarios:
 
 1 default instance per JVM for the lifetime of that JVM.
DropTarget
The
DropTarget
is associated
 with a
Component
when that
Component
wishes
 to accept drops during Drag and Drop operations.

Class
Description
DragGestureEvent
A
DragGestureEvent
is passed
 to
DragGestureListener
's
 dragGestureRecognized() method
 when a particular
DragGestureRecognizer
detects that a
 platform dependent drag initiating gesture has occurred
 on the
Component
that it is tracking.
DragGestureListener
The listener interface for receiving drag gesture events.
DragGestureRecognizer
The
DragGestureRecognizer
is an
 abstract base class for the specification
 of a platform-dependent listener that can be associated with a particular
Component
in order to
 identify platform-dependent drag initiating gestures.
DragSource
The
DragSource
is the entity responsible
 for the initiation of the Drag
 and Drop operation, and may be used in a number of scenarios:
 
 1 default instance per JVM for the lifetime of that JVM.
DragSourceContext
The
DragSourceContext
class is responsible for managing the
 initiator side of the Drag and Drop protocol.
DragSourceDragEvent
The
DragSourceDragEvent
is
 delivered from the
DragSourceContextPeer
,
 via the
DragSourceContext
, to the
DragSourceListener
registered with that
DragSourceContext
and with its associated
DragSource
.
DragSourceDropEvent
The
DragSourceDropEvent
is delivered
 from the
DragSourceContextPeer
,
 via the
DragSourceContext
, to the
dragDropEnd
method of
DragSourceListener
s registered with that
DragSourceContext
and with its associated
DragSource
.
DragSourceEvent
This class is the base class for
DragSourceDragEvent
and
DragSourceDropEvent
.
DragSourceListener
The
DragSourceListener
defines the
 event interface for originators of
 Drag and Drop operations to track the state of the user's gesture, and to
 provide appropriate "drag over"
 feedback to the user throughout the
 Drag and Drop operation.
DragSourceMotionListener
A listener interface for receiving mouse motion events during a drag
 operation.
DropTarget
The
DropTarget
is associated
 with a
Component
when that
Component
wishes
 to accept drops during Drag and Drop operations.
DropTarget.DropTargetAutoScroller
this protected nested class implements autoscrolling
DropTargetContext
A
DropTargetContext
is created
 whenever the logical cursor associated
 with a Drag and Drop operation coincides with the visible geometry of
 a
Component
associated with a
DropTarget
.
DropTargetDragEvent
The
DropTargetDragEvent
is delivered to a
DropTargetListener
via its
 dragEnter() and dragOver() methods.
DropTargetDropEvent
The
DropTargetDropEvent
is delivered
 via the
DropTargetListener
drop() method.
DropTargetEvent
The
DropTargetEvent
is the base
 class for both the
DropTargetDragEvent
and the
DropTargetDropEvent
.
DropTargetListener
The
DropTargetListener
interface
 is the callback interface used by the
DropTarget
class to provide
 notification of DnD operations that involve
 the subject
DropTarget
.
InvalidDnDOperationException
This exception is thrown by various methods in the java.awt.dnd package.
