Class DragGestureRecognizer
java.lang.Object
java.awt.dnd.DragGestureRecognizer
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
Direct Known Subclasses:
MouseDragGestureRecognizer
public abstract class
DragGestureRecognizer
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
The
DragGestureRecognizer
is an
 abstract base class for the specification
 of a platform-dependent listener that can be associated with a particular
Component
in order to
 identify platform-dependent drag initiating gestures.
The appropriate
DragGestureRecognizer
subclass instance is obtained from the
DragSource
associated with
 a particular
Component
, or from the
Toolkit
object via its
createDragGestureRecognizer()
method.
Once the
DragGestureRecognizer
is associated with a particular
Component
it will register the appropriate listener interfaces on that
Component
in order to track the input events delivered to the
Component
.
Once the
DragGestureRecognizer
identifies a sequence of events
 on the
Component
as a drag initiating gesture, it will notify
 its unicast
DragGestureListener
by
 invoking its
gestureRecognized()
method.
When a concrete
DragGestureRecognizer
instance detects a drag initiating
 gesture on the
Component
it is associated with,
 it fires a
DragGestureEvent
to
 the
DragGestureListener
registered on
 its unicast event source for
DragGestureListener
events. This
DragGestureListener
is responsible
 for causing the associated
DragSource
to start the Drag and Drop operation (if
 appropriate).

void
appendEvent
(
InputEvent
awtie)
Listeners registered on the Component by this Recognizer shall record
 all Events that are recognized as part of the series of Events that go
 to comprise a Drag and Drop initiating gesture via this API.
This method is used by a
DragGestureRecognizer
implementation to add an
InputEvent
subclass (that it believes is one in a series
 of events that comprise a Drag and Drop operation)
 to the array of events that this
DragGestureRecognizer
maintains internally.
Parameters:
awtie
- the
InputEvent
to add to this
DragGestureRecognizer
's
 internal array of events. Note that
null
is not a valid value, and will be ignored.
