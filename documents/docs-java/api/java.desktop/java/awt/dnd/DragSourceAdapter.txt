Class DragSourceAdapter
java.lang.Object
java.awt.dnd.DragSourceAdapter
All Implemented Interfaces:
DragSourceListener
,
DragSourceMotionListener
,
EventListener
public abstract class
DragSourceAdapter
extends
Object
implements
DragSourceListener
,
DragSourceMotionListener
An abstract adapter class for receiving drag source events. The methods in
 this class are empty. This class exists only as a convenience for creating
 listener objects.
Extend this class to create a
DragSourceEvent
listener
 and override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the
DragSourceListener
interface, you have to define all of
 the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them
 all, so you only have to define methods for events you care about.)
Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with
 a
DragSource
. When the drag enters, moves over, or exits
 a drop site, when the drop action changes, and when the drag ends, the
 relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and the
DragSourceEvent
is passed to it.
The drop site is
associated with the previous
dragEnter()
invocation
if the latest invocation of
dragEnter()
on this
 adapter corresponds to that drop site and is not followed by a
dragExit()
invocation on this adapter.

Method Details
dragEnter
public
void
dragEnter
(
DragSourceDragEvent
dsde)
Called as the cursor's hotspot enters a platform-dependent drop site.
 This method is invoked when all the following conditions are true:
The cursor's hotspot enters the operable part of
 a platform-dependent drop site.
The drop site is active.
The drop site accepts the drag.
Specified by:
dragEnter
in interface
DragSourceListener
Parameters:
dsde
- the
DragSourceDragEvent
dragOver
public
void
dragOver
(
DragSourceDragEvent
dsde)
Called as the cursor's hotspot moves over a platform-dependent drop site.
 This method is invoked when all the following conditions are true:
The cursor's hotspot has moved, but still intersects the
 operable part of the drop site associated with the previous
 dragEnter() invocation.
The drop site is still active.
The drop site accepts the drag.
Specified by:
dragOver
in interface
DragSourceListener
Parameters:
dsde
- the
DragSourceDragEvent
dragMouseMoved
public
void
dragMouseMoved
(
DragSourceDragEvent
dsde)
Called whenever the mouse is moved during a drag operation.
Specified by:
dragMouseMoved
in interface
DragSourceMotionListener
Parameters:
dsde
- the
DragSourceDragEvent
dropActionChanged
public
void
dropActionChanged
(
DragSourceDragEvent
dsde)
Called when the user has modified the drop gesture.
 This method is invoked when the state of the input
 device(s) that the user is interacting with changes.
 Such devices are typically the mouse buttons or keyboard
 modifiers that the user is interacting with.
Specified by:
dropActionChanged
in interface
DragSourceListener
Parameters:
dsde
- the
DragSourceDragEvent
dragExit
public
void
dragExit
(
DragSourceEvent
dse)
Called as the cursor's hotspot exits a platform-dependent drop site.
 This method is invoked when any of the following conditions are true:
The cursor's hotspot no longer intersects the operable part
 of the drop site associated with the previous dragEnter() invocation.
OR
The drop site associated with the previous dragEnter() invocation
 is no longer active.
OR
The drop site associated with the previous dragEnter() invocation
 has rejected the drag.
Specified by:
dragExit
in interface
DragSourceListener
Parameters:
dse
- the
DragSourceEvent
dragDropEnd
public
void
dragDropEnd
(
DragSourceDropEvent
dsde)
This method is invoked to signify that the Drag and Drop
 operation is complete. The getDropSuccess() method of
 the
DragSourceDropEvent
can be used to
 determine the termination state. The getDropAction() method
 returns the operation that the drop site selected
 to apply to the Drop operation. Once this method is complete, the
 current
DragSourceContext
and
 associated resources become invalid.
Specified by:
dragDropEnd
in interface
DragSourceListener
Parameters:
dsde
- the
DragSourceDropEvent
