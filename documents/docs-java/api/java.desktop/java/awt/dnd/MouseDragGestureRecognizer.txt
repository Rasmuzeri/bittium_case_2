public abstract class
MouseDragGestureRecognizer
extends
DragGestureRecognizer
implements
MouseListener
,
MouseMotionListener
This abstract subclass of
DragGestureRecognizer
defines a
DragGestureRecognizer
for mouse-based gestures.

 Each platform implements its own concrete subclass of this class,
 available via the Toolkit.createDragGestureRecognizer() method,
 to encapsulate
 the recognition of the platform dependent mouse gesture(s) that initiate
 a Drag and Drop operation.
Mouse drag gesture recognizers should honor the
 drag gesture motion threshold, available through
DragSource.getDragThreshold()
.
 A drag gesture should be recognized only when the distance
 in either the horizontal or vertical direction between
 the location of the latest mouse dragged event and the
 location of the corresponding mouse button pressed event
 is greater than the drag gesture motion threshold.
Drag gesture recognizers created with
DragSource.createDefaultDragGestureRecognizer(java.awt.Component, int, java.awt.dnd.DragGestureListener)
follow this convention.
