java.awt.dnd.DropTargetContext.TransferableProxy
All Implemented Interfaces:
Transferable
Enclosing class:
DropTargetContext
protected class
DropTargetContext.TransferableProxy
extends
Object
implements
Transferable
TransferableProxy
is a helper inner class that implements
Transferable
interface and serves as a proxy for another
Transferable
object which represents data transfer for
 a particular drag-n-drop operation.
The proxy forwards all requests to the encapsulated transferable
 and automatically performs additional conversion on the data
 returned by the encapsulated transferable in case of local transfer.

Returns an object which represents the data provided by
 the encapsulated transferable for the requested data flavor.
In case of local transfer a serialized copy of the object
 returned by the encapsulated transferable is provided when
 the data is requested in application/x-java-serialized-object
 data flavor.
Specified by:
getTransferData
in interface
Transferable
Parameters:
df
- the requested flavor for the data
Returns:
an object which represents the data to be transferred
Throws:
IOException
- if the data is no longer available
              in the requested flavor.
UnsupportedFlavorException
- if the requested data flavor is
              not supported.
