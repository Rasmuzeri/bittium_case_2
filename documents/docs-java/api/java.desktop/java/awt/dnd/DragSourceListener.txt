Interface DragSourceListener
All Superinterfaces:
EventListener
All Known Implementing Classes:
DragSourceAdapter
,
DragSourceContext
public interface
DragSourceListener
extends
EventListener
The
DragSourceListener
defines the
 event interface for originators of
 Drag and Drop operations to track the state of the user's gesture, and to
 provide appropriate "drag over"
 feedback to the user throughout the
 Drag and Drop operation.
The drop site is
associated with the previous
dragEnter()
invocation
if the latest invocation of
dragEnter()
on this
 listener:
corresponds to that drop site and
is not followed by a
dragExit()
invocation on this listener.

Description
void
dragDropEnd
(
DragSourceDropEvent
dsde)
This method is invoked to signify that the Drag and Drop
 operation is complete.
void
dragEnter
(
DragSourceDragEvent
dsde)
Called as the cursor's hotspot enters a platform-dependent drop site.
void
dragExit
(
DragSourceEvent
dse)
Called as the cursor's hotspot exits a platform-dependent drop site.
void
dragOver
(
DragSourceDragEvent
dsde)
Called as the cursor's hotspot moves over a platform-dependent drop site.
void
dropActionChanged
(
DragSourceDragEvent
dsde)
Called when the user has modified the drop gesture.
Method Details
dragEnter
void
dragEnter
(
DragSourceDragEvent
dsde)
Called as the cursor's hotspot enters a platform-dependent drop site.
 This method is invoked when all the following conditions are true:
The cursor's hotspot enters the operable part of a platform-
 dependent drop site.
The drop site is active.
The drop site accepts the drag.
Parameters:
dsde
- the
DragSourceDragEvent
dragOver
void
dragOver
(
DragSourceDragEvent
dsde)
Called as the cursor's hotspot moves over a platform-dependent drop site.
 This method is invoked when all the following conditions are true:
The cursor's hotspot has moved, but still intersects the
 operable part of the drop site associated with the previous
 dragEnter() invocation.
The drop site is still active.
The drop site accepts the drag.
Parameters:
dsde
- the
DragSourceDragEvent
dropActionChanged
void
dropActionChanged
(
DragSourceDragEvent
dsde)
Called when the user has modified the drop gesture.
 This method is invoked when the state of the input
 device(s) that the user is interacting with changes.
 Such devices are typically the mouse buttons or keyboard
 modifiers that the user is interacting with.
Parameters:
dsde
- the
DragSourceDragEvent
dragExit
void
dragExit
(
DragSourceEvent
dse)
Called as the cursor's hotspot exits a platform-dependent drop site.
 This method is invoked when any of the following conditions are true:
The cursor's hotspot no longer intersects the operable part
 of the drop site associated with the previous dragEnter() invocation.
OR
The drop site associated with the previous dragEnter() invocation
 is no longer active.
OR
The drop site associated with the previous dragEnter() invocation
 has rejected the drag.
Parameters:
dse
- the
DragSourceEvent
dragDropEnd
void
dragDropEnd
(
DragSourceDropEvent
dsde)
This method is invoked to signify that the Drag and Drop
 operation is complete. The getDropSuccess() method of
 the
DragSourceDropEvent
can be used to
 determine the termination state. The getDropAction() method
 returns the operation that the drop site selected
 to apply to the Drop operation. Once this method is complete, the
 current
DragSourceContext
and
 associated resources become invalid.
Parameters:
dsde
- the
DragSourceDropEvent
