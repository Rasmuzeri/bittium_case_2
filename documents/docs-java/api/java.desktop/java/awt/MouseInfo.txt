Method Details
getPointerInfo
public static
PointerInfo
getPointerInfo
()
                                  throws
HeadlessException
Returns a
PointerInfo
instance that represents the current
 location of the mouse pointer.
 The
GraphicsDevice
stored in this
PointerInfo
contains the mouse pointer. The coordinate system used for the mouse position
 depends on whether or not the
GraphicsDevice
is part of a virtual
 screen device.
 For virtual screen devices, the coordinates are given in the virtual
 coordinate system, otherwise they are returned in the coordinate system
 of the
GraphicsDevice
. See
GraphicsConfiguration
for more information about the virtual screen devices.
 On systems without a mouse, returns
null
.
If there is a security manager, its
checkPermission
method
 is called with an
AWTPermission("watchMousePointer")
permission before creating and returning a
PointerInfo
object. This may result in a
SecurityException
.
Returns:
location of the mouse pointer
Throws:
HeadlessException
- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless() returns true
SecurityException
- if a security manager exists and its
checkPermission
method doesn't allow the operation
Since:
1.5

public static
int
getNumberOfButtons
()
                              throws
HeadlessException
Returns the number of buttons on the mouse.
 On systems without a mouse, returns
-1
.
 The number of buttons is obtained from the AWT Toolkit
 by requesting the
"awt.mouse.numButtons"
desktop property
 which is set by the underlying native platform.
Returns:
number of buttons on the mouse
Throws:
HeadlessException
- if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless() returns true
Since:
1.5
