RadialGradientPaint
This is the superclass for Paints which use a multiple color
 gradient to fill in their raster.  It provides storage for variables and
 enumerated values common to
LinearGradientPaint
and

Method Details
getFractions
public final
float[]
getFractions
()
Returns a copy of the array of floats used by this gradient
 to calculate color distribution.
 The returned array always has 0 as its first value and 1 as its
 last value, with increasing values in between.
Returns:
a copy of the array of floats used by this gradient to
 calculate color distribution
getColors
public final
Color
[]
getColors
()
Returns a copy of the array of colors used by this gradient.
 The first color maps to the first value in the fractions array,
 and the last color maps to the last value in the fractions array.
Returns:
a copy of the array of colors used by this gradient
getCycleMethod
public final
MultipleGradientPaint.CycleMethod
getCycleMethod
()
Returns the enumerated type which specifies cycling behavior.
Returns:
the enumerated type which specifies cycling behavior
getColorSpace
public final
MultipleGradientPaint.ColorSpaceType
getColorSpace
()
Returns the enumerated type which specifies color space for
 interpolation.
Returns:
the enumerated type which specifies color space for
 interpolation
getTransform
public final
AffineTransform
getTransform
()
Returns a copy of the transform applied to the gradient.
Note that if no transform is applied to the gradient
 when it is created, the identity transform is used.
Returns:
a copy of the transform applied to the gradient
getTransparency
public final
int
getTransparency
()
Returns the transparency mode for this
Paint
object.
Specified by:
getTransparency
in interface
Transparency
Returns:
OPAQUE
if all colors used by this
Paint
object are opaque,
TRANSLUCENT
if at least one of the
         colors used by this
Paint
object is not opaque.
