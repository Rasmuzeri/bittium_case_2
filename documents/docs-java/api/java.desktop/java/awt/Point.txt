 This method is included for completeness, to parallel the
getLocation
method of
Component
.
Returns:
a copy of this point, at the same location

- a point, the new location for this point
Since:
1.1
See Also:
Component.setLocation(java.awt.Point)
getLocation()

Changes the point to have the specified location.
This method is included for completeness, to parallel the
setLocation
method of
Component
.
 Its behavior is identical with
move(int, int)
.
Parameters:

setLocation
public
void
setLocation
(double x,
 double y)
Sets the location of this point to the specified double coordinates.
 The double values will be rounded to integer values.
 Any number smaller than
Integer.MIN_VALUE
will be reset to
MIN_VALUE
, and any number
 larger than

getLocation()
move
public
void
move
(int x,
 int y)
Moves this point to the specified location in the
(x,y)
coordinate plane. This method
 is identical with
setLocation(int, int)
.
Parameters:
x
- the X coordinate of the new location
y
- the Y coordinate of the new location
See Also:
Component.setLocation(int, int)
translate
public
void
translate
(int dx,
 int dy)
Translates this point, at location
(x,y)
,
 by
dx
along the
x
axis and
dy
along the
y
axis so that it now represents the point
(x+dx,y+dy)
.
Parameters:
dx
- the distance to move this point
                            along the X axis
dy
- the distance to move this point
                            along the Y axis
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Determines whether or not two points are equal. Two instances of
Point2D
are equal if the values of their
x
and
y
member fields, representing
 their position in the coordinate space, are the same.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Point2D
Parameters:
obj
- an object to be compared with this
Point2D
Returns:
true
if the object to be compared is
         an instance of
Point2D
and has
         the same values;
false
otherwise.

Object.hashCode()
HashMap
toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns a string representation of this point and its location
 in the
(x,y)
coordinate space. This method is
 intended to be used only for debugging purposes, and the content
 and format of the returned string may vary between implementations.
 The returned string may be empty but may not be
null
.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
a string representation of this point
