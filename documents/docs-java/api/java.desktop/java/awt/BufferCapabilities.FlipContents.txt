Method Details
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Description copied from class:
Object
Returns a hash code value for the object. This method is
 supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by
HashMap
.
The general contract of
hashCode
is:
Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during
     an execution of a Java application, the
hashCode
method
     must consistently return the same integer, provided no information
     used in
equals
comparisons on the object is modified.
     This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
     application to another execution of the same application.
If two objects are equal according to the
equals
method, then calling the
hashCode
method on each of the two objects must produce the
     same integer result.
It is
not
required that if two objects are unequal
     according to the
equals
method, then
     calling the
hashCode
method on each of the two objects
     must produce distinct integer results.  However, the programmer
     should be aware that producing distinct integer results for
     unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
a hash code value for this object.

toString
()
Description copied from class:
