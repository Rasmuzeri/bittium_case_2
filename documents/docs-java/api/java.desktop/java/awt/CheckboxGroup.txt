Class CheckboxGroup
java.lang.Object
java.awt.CheckboxGroup
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
CheckboxGroup
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
The
CheckboxGroup
class is used to group together
 a set of
Checkbox
buttons.
Exactly one check box button in a
CheckboxGroup
can
 be in the "on" state at any given time. Pushing any
 button sets its state to "on" and forces any other button that
 is in the "on" state into the "off" state.
The following code example produces a new check box group,
 with three check boxes:
setLayout(new GridLayout(3, 1));
 CheckboxGroup cbg = new CheckboxGroup();
 add(new Checkbox("one", cbg, true));
 add(new Checkbox("two", cbg, false));
 add(new Checkbox("three", cbg, false));
This image depicts the check box group created by this example:
