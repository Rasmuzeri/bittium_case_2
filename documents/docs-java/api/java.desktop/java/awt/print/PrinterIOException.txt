All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
PrinterIOException
extends
PrinterException
The
PrinterIOException
class is a subclass of
PrinterException
and is used to indicate that an IO error
 of some sort has occurred while printing.
As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to conform to
 the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism.  The
 "
IOException
that terminated the print job"
 that is provided at construction time and accessed via the
getIOException()
method is now known as the
cause
,
 and may be accessed via the
Throwable.getCause()
method,
 as well as the aforementioned "legacy method."
