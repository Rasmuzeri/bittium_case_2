Class Paper
java.lang.Object
java.awt.print.Paper
All Implemented Interfaces:
Cloneable
public class
Paper
extends
Object
implements
Cloneable
The
Paper
class describes the physical characteristics of
 a piece of paper.
When creating a
Paper
object, it is the application's
 responsibility to ensure that the paper size and the imageable area
 are compatible.  For example, if the paper size is changed from
 11 x 17 to 8.5 x 11, the application might need to reduce the
 imageable area so that whatever is printed fits on the page.
