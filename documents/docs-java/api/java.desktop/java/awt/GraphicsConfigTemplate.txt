Class GraphicsConfigTemplate
java.lang.Object
java.awt.GraphicsConfigTemplate
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public abstract class
GraphicsConfigTemplate
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
The
GraphicsConfigTemplate
class is used to obtain a valid
GraphicsConfiguration
.  A user instantiates one of these
 objects and then sets all non-default attributes as desired.  The
GraphicsDevice.getBestConfiguration(java.awt.GraphicsConfigTemplate)
method found in the
GraphicsDevice
class is then called with this
GraphicsConfigTemplate
.  A valid
GraphicsConfiguration
is returned that meets or exceeds
 what was requested in the
GraphicsConfigTemplate
.
Since:
1.2

Value used for "Enum" (Integer) type.  States that this
 feature is required for the
GraphicsConfiguration
object.  If this feature is not available, do not select the
GraphicsConfiguration
object.

PREFERRED
public static final
int
PREFERRED
Value used for "Enum" (Integer) type.  States that this
 feature is desired for the
GraphicsConfiguration
object.  A selection with this feature is preferred over a
 selection that does not include this feature, although both
 selections can be considered valid matches.

UNNECESSARY
public static final
int
UNNECESSARY
Value used for "Enum" (Integer) type.  States that this
 feature is not necessary for the selection of the
GraphicsConfiguration
object.  A selection
 without this feature is preferred over a selection that
