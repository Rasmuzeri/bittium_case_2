Interface InputMethodDescriptor

InputMethodDescriptor
Defines methods that provide sufficient information about an input method
 to enable selection and loading of that input method.
 The input method itself is only loaded when it is actually used.
Since:
1.3

Description
InputMethod
createInputMethod
()
Creates a new instance of the corresponding input method.
Locale
[]
getAvailableLocales
()
Returns the locales supported by the corresponding input method.
String
getInputMethodDisplayName
(
Locale
inputLocale,
Locale
displayLanguage)
Returns the user-visible name of the corresponding
 input method for the given input locale in the language in which
 the name will be displayed.
Image
getInputMethodIcon
(
Locale
inputLocale)
Returns an icon for the corresponding input method.
boolean
hasDynamicLocaleList
()
Returns whether the list of available locales can change
 at runtime.
Method Details
getAvailableLocales
Locale
[]
getAvailableLocales
()
                      throws
AWTException
Returns the locales supported by the corresponding input method.
 The locale may describe just the language, or may also include
 country and variant information if needed.
 The information is used to select input methods by locale
 (
InputContext.selectInputMethod(Locale)
). It may also
 be used to sort input methods by locale in a user-visible
 list of input methods.
Only the input method's primary locales should be returned.
 For example, if a Japanese input method also has a pass-through
 mode for Roman characters, typically still only Japanese would
 be returned. Thus, the list of locales returned is typically
 a subset of the locales for which the corresponding input method's
 implementation of
InputMethod.setLocale(java.util.Locale)
returns true.
If
hasDynamicLocaleList()
returns true, this method is
 called each time the information is needed. This
 gives input methods that depend on network resources the chance
 to add or remove locales as resources become available or
 unavailable.
Returns:
the locales supported by the input method
Throws:
AWTException
- if it can be determined that the input method
 is inoperable, for example, because of incomplete installation.
hasDynamicLocaleList
boolean
hasDynamicLocaleList
()
Returns whether the list of available locales can change
 at runtime. This may be the case, for example, for adapters
 that access real input methods over the network.
Returns:
whether the list of available locales can change at
 runtime
getInputMethodDisplayName
String
getInputMethodDisplayName
(
Locale
inputLocale,
Locale
displayLanguage)
Returns the user-visible name of the corresponding
 input method for the given input locale in the language in which
 the name will be displayed.
The inputLocale parameter specifies the locale for which text
 is input.
 This parameter can only take values obtained from this descriptor's
getAvailableLocales()
method or null. If it is null, an
 input locale independent name for the input method should be
 returned.
If a name for the desired display language is not available, the
 method may fall back to some other language.
Parameters:
inputLocale
- the locale for which text input is supported, or null
displayLanguage
- the language in which the name will be displayed
Returns:
the user-visible name of the corresponding input method
 for the given input locale in the language in which the name
 will be displayed
getInputMethodIcon
Image
getInputMethodIcon
(
Locale
inputLocale)
Returns an icon for the corresponding input method.
 The icon may be used by a user interface for selecting input methods.
The inputLocale parameter specifies the locale for which text
 is input.
 This parameter can only take values obtained from this descriptor's
getAvailableLocales()
method or null. If it is null, an
 input locale independent icon for the input method should be
 returned.
The icon's size should be 16×16 pixels.
Parameters:
inputLocale
- the locale for which text input is supported, or null
Returns:
an icon for the corresponding input method, or null
createInputMethod
InputMethod
createInputMethod
()
                       throws
Exception
Creates a new instance of the corresponding input method.
Returns:
a new instance of the corresponding input method
Throws:
Exception
- any exception that may occur while creating the
 input method instance
