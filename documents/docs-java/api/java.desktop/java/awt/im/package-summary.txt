java.awt.im
Provides classes and interfaces for the input method framework. This package
 enables text editing components to receive text input through input methods.
 Input methods are software components that let the user enter text in ways
 other than simple typing on a keyboard. They are commonly used to enter
 Japanese, Chinese, or Korean - languages using thousands of different
 characters - on keyboards with far fewer keys. However, the framework also
 supports input methods for other languages and the use of entirely different
 input mechanisms, such as handwriting or speech recognition.
