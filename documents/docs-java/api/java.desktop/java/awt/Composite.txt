Interface Composite
All Known Implementing Classes:
AlphaComposite
public interface
Composite
The
Composite
interface, along with
CompositeContext
, defines the methods to compose a draw
 primitive with the underlying graphics area.
 After the
Composite
is set in the
Graphics2D
context, it combines a shape, text, or an image
 being rendered with the colors that have already been rendered
 according to pre-defined rules. The classes
 implementing this interface provide the rules and a method to create
 the context for a particular operation.
CompositeContext
is an environment used by the
 compositing operation, which is created by the
Graphics2D
prior to the start of the operation.
CompositeContext
contains private information and resources needed for a compositing
 operation.  When the
CompositeContext
is no longer needed,
 the
Graphics2D
object disposes of it in order to reclaim
 resources allocated for the operation.
Instances of classes implementing
Composite
must be
 immutable because the
Graphics2D
does not clone
 these objects when they are set as an attribute with the
setComposite
method or when the
Graphics2D
object is cloned.  This is to avoid undefined rendering behavior of
Graphics2D
, resulting from the modification of
 the
Composite
object after it has been set in the
Graphics2D
context.
Since this interface must expose the contents of pixels on the
 target device or image to potentially arbitrary code, the use of
 custom objects which implement this interface when rendering directly
 to a screen device is governed by the
readDisplayPixels
AWTPermission
.  The permission check will occur when such
 a custom object is passed to the
setComposite
method
 of a
Graphics2D
retrieved from a
Component
.

Creates a context containing state that is used to perform
 the compositing operation.

createContext
CompositeContext
createContext
(
ColorModel
srcColorModel,
ColorModel
dstColorModel,
RenderingHints
hints)
Creates a context containing state that is used to perform
 the compositing operation.  In a multi-threaded environment,
 several contexts can exist simultaneously for a single
Composite
object.
Parameters:
srcColorModel
- the
ColorModel
of the source
dstColorModel
- the
ColorModel
of the destination
hints
- the hint that the context object uses to choose between
 rendering alternatives
Returns:
the
CompositeContext
object used to perform the
 compositing operation.
