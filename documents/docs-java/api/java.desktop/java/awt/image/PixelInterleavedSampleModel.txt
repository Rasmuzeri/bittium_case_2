Class PixelInterleavedSampleModel
java.lang.Object
java.awt.image.SampleModel
java.awt.image.ComponentSampleModel
java.awt.image.PixelInterleavedSampleModel
public class
PixelInterleavedSampleModel
extends
ComponentSampleModel
This class represents image data which is stored in a pixel interleaved
  fashion and for
  which each sample of a pixel occupies one data element of the DataBuffer.
  It subclasses ComponentSampleModel but provides a more efficient
  implementation for accessing pixel interleaved image data than is provided
  by ComponentSampleModel.  This class
  stores sample data for all bands in a single bank of the
  DataBuffer. Accessor methods are provided so that image data can be
  manipulated directly. Pixel stride is the number of
  data array elements between two samples for the same band on the same
  scanline. Scanline stride is the number of data array elements between
  a given sample and the corresponding sample in the same column of the next
  scanline.  Band offsets denote the number
  of data array elements from the first data array element of the bank
  of the DataBuffer holding each band to the first sample of the band.
  The bands are numbered from 0 to N-1.
  Bank indices denote the correspondence between a bank of the data buffer
  and a band of image data.
  This class supports
TYPE_BYTE
,
TYPE_USHORT
,
TYPE_SHORT
,
TYPE_INT
,
TYPE_FLOAT
and
TYPE_DOUBLE
datatypes.

Constructor Details
PixelInterleavedSampleModel
public
PixelInterleavedSampleModel
(int dataType,
 int w,
 int h,
 int pixelStride,
 int scanlineStride,
 int[] bandOffsets)
Constructs a PixelInterleavedSampleModel with the specified parameters.
 The number of bands will be given by the length of the bandOffsets
 array.
Parameters:
dataType
- The data type for storing samples.
w
- The width (in pixels) of the region of
                  image data described.
h
- The height (in pixels) of the region of
                  image data described.
pixelStride
- The pixel stride of the image data.
scanlineStride
- The line stride of the image data.
bandOffsets
- The offsets of all bands.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
w
or
h
is not greater than 0
IllegalArgumentException
- if any offset between bands is
         greater than the scanline stride
IllegalArgumentException
- if the product of
pixelStride
and
w
is greater
         than
scanlineStride
IllegalArgumentException
- if
pixelStride
is
         less than any offset between bands
IllegalArgumentException
- if
dataType
is not
         one of the supported data types
Method Details
createCompatibleSampleModel
public
SampleModel
createCompatibleSampleModel
(int w,
 int h)
Creates a new PixelInterleavedSampleModel with the specified
 width and height.  The new PixelInterleavedSampleModel will have the
 same number of bands, storage data type, and pixel stride
 as this PixelInterleavedSampleModel.  The band offsets may be
 compressed such that the minimum of all of the band offsets is zero.
Overrides:
createCompatibleSampleModel
in class
ComponentSampleModel
Parameters:
w
- the width of the resulting
SampleModel
h
- the height of the resulting
SampleModel
Returns:
a new
SampleModel
with the specified width
         and height.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
w
or
h
is not greater than 0
createSubsetSampleModel
public
SampleModel
createSubsetSampleModel
(int[] bands)
Creates a new PixelInterleavedSampleModel with a subset of the
 bands of this PixelInterleavedSampleModel.  The new
 PixelInterleavedSampleModel can be used with any DataBuffer that the
 existing PixelInterleavedSampleModel can be used with.  The new
 PixelInterleavedSampleModel/DataBuffer combination will represent
 an image with a subset of the bands of the original
 PixelInterleavedSampleModel/DataBuffer combination.
Overrides:
createSubsetSampleModel
in class
ComponentSampleModel
Parameters:
bands
- a subset of bands from this
ComponentSampleModel
Returns:
a
ComponentSampleModel
created with a subset
          of bands from this
ComponentSampleModel
