Uses of Interface
java.awt.image.ImageConsumer
Packages that use
ImageConsumer
Package
Description
java.awt.image
Provides classes for creating and modifying images.
java.awt.image.renderable
Provides classes and interfaces for producing rendering-independent images.
javax.swing
Provides a set of "lightweight" (all-Java language) components
 that, to the maximum degree possible, work the same on all platforms.
Uses of
ImageConsumer
in
java.awt.image
Classes in
java.awt.image
that implement
ImageConsumer
Modifier and Type
Class
Description
class
AreaAveragingScaleFilter
An ImageFilter class for scaling images using a simple area averaging
 algorithm that produces smoother results than the nearest neighbor
 algorithm.
class
BufferedImageFilter
The
BufferedImageFilter
class subclasses an
ImageFilter
to provide a simple means of
 using a single-source/single-destination image operator
 (
BufferedImageOp
) to filter a
BufferedImage
in the Image Producer/Consumer/Observer
 paradigm.
class
CropImageFilter
An ImageFilter class for cropping images.
class
ImageFilter
This class implements a filter for the set of interface methods that
 are used to deliver data from an ImageProducer to an ImageConsumer.
class
PixelGrabber
The PixelGrabber class implements an ImageConsumer which can be attached
 to an Image or ImageProducer object to retrieve a subset of the pixels
 in that image.
class
ReplicateScaleFilter
An ImageFilter class for scaling images using the simplest algorithm.
class
RGBImageFilter
This class provides an easy way to create an ImageFilter which modifies
 the pixels of an image in the default RGB ColorModel.
Fields in
java.awt.image
declared as
ImageConsumer
Modifier and Type
Field
Description
protected
ImageConsumer
ImageFilter.
consumer
The consumer of the particular image data stream for which this
 instance of the ImageFilter is filtering data.
Methods in
java.awt.image
with parameters of type
ImageConsumer
Modifier and Type
Method
Description
void
FilteredImageSource.
addConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Adds the specified
ImageConsumer
to the list of consumers interested in data for the filtered image.
void
ImageProducer.
addConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Registers an
ImageConsumer
with the
ImageProducer
for access to the image data
 during a later reconstruction of the
Image
.
void
MemoryImageSource.
addConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Adds an ImageConsumer to the list of consumers interested in
 data for this image.
ImageFilter
ImageFilter.
getFilterInstance
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Returns a unique instance of an ImageFilter object which will
 actually perform the filtering for the specified ImageConsumer.
boolean
FilteredImageSource.
isConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Determines whether an ImageConsumer is on the list of consumers
 currently interested in data for this image.
boolean
ImageProducer.
isConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Determines if a specified
ImageConsumer
object is currently registered with this
ImageProducer
as one of its consumers.
boolean
MemoryImageSource.
isConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Determines if an ImageConsumer is on the list of consumers currently
 interested in data for this image.
void
FilteredImageSource.
removeConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Removes an ImageConsumer from the list of consumers interested in
 data for this image.
void
ImageProducer.
removeConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Removes the specified
ImageConsumer
object
 from the list of consumers currently registered to
 receive image data.
void
MemoryImageSource.
removeConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Removes an ImageConsumer from the list of consumers interested in
 data for this image.
void
FilteredImageSource.
requestTopDownLeftRightResend
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Requests that a given ImageConsumer have the image data delivered
 one more time in top-down, left-right order.
void
ImageProducer.
requestTopDownLeftRightResend
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Requests, on behalf of the
ImageConsumer
,
 that the
ImageProducer
attempt to resend
 the image data one more time in TOPDOWNLEFTRIGHT order
 so that higher quality conversion algorithms which
 depend on receiving pixels in order can be used to
 produce a better output version of the image.
void
MemoryImageSource.
requestTopDownLeftRightResend
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Requests that a given ImageConsumer have the image data delivered
 one more time in top-down, left-right order.
void
FilteredImageSource.
startProduction
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Starts production of the filtered image.
void
ImageProducer.
startProduction
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Registers the specified
ImageConsumer
object
 as a consumer and starts an immediate reconstruction of
 the image data which will then be delivered to this
 consumer and any other consumer which might have already
 been registered with the producer.
void
MemoryImageSource.
startProduction
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Adds an ImageConsumer to the list of consumers interested in
 data for this image and immediately starts delivery of the
 image data through the ImageConsumer interface.
