Description
ContextualRenderedImageFactory
ContextualRenderedImageFactory provides an interface for the
 functionality that may differ between instances of
 RenderableImageOp.
ParameterBlock
A
ParameterBlock
encapsulates all the information about sources and
 parameters (Objects) required by a RenderableImageOp, or other
 classes that process images.
RenderableImage
A RenderableImage is a common interface for rendering-independent
 images (a notion which subsumes resolution independence).
RenderableImageOp
This class handles the renderable aspects of an operation with help
 from its associated instance of a ContextualRenderedImageFactory.
RenderableImageProducer
An adapter class that implements ImageProducer to allow the
 asynchronous production of a RenderableImage.
RenderContext
A RenderContext encapsulates the information needed to produce a
 specific rendering from a RenderableImage.
RenderedImageFactory
The RenderedImageFactory interface (often abbreviated RIF) is
 intended to be implemented by classes that wish to act as factories
 to produce different renderings, for example by executing a series
 of BufferedImageOps on a set of sources, depending on a specific
 set of parameters, properties, and rendering hints.
