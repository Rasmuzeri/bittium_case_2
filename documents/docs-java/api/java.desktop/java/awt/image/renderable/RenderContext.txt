Class RenderContext
java.lang.Object
java.awt.image.renderable.RenderContext
All Implemented Interfaces:
Cloneable
public class
RenderContext
extends
Object
implements
Cloneable
A RenderContext encapsulates the information needed to produce a
 specific rendering from a RenderableImage.  It contains the area to
 be rendered specified in rendering-independent terms, the
 resolution at which the rendering is to be performed, and hints
 used to control the rendering process.
Users create RenderContexts and pass them to the
 RenderableImage via the createRendering method.  Most of the methods of
 RenderContexts are not meant to be used directly by applications,
 but by the RenderableImage and operator classes to which it is
 passed.
The AffineTransform parameter passed into and out of this class
 are cloned.  The RenderingHints and Shape parameters are not
 necessarily cloneable and are therefore only reference copied.
 Altering RenderingHints or Shape instances that are in use by
 instances of RenderContext may have undesired side effects.

RenderingHints
getRenderingHints
()
Gets the rendering hints of this
RenderContext
.
Returns:
a
RenderingHints
object that represents
 the rendering hints of this
RenderContext
.
See Also:
setRenderingHints(RenderingHints)
setRenderingHints
public
void
setRenderingHints
(

preConcatenateTransform
public
void
preConcatenateTransform
(
AffineTransform
modTransform)
Modifies the current user-to-device transform by prepending another
 transform.  In matrix notation the operation is:
[this] = [modTransform] x [this]
Parameters:
modTransform
- the AffineTransform to prepend to the
        current usr2dev transform.
Since:
1.3

preConcatenateTransform(AffineTransform)
.
Modifies the current user-to-device transform by prepending another
 transform.  In matrix notation the operation is:
[this] = [modTransform] x [this]
This method does the same thing as the preConcatenateTransform
 method.  It is here for backward compatibility with previous releases
 which misspelled the method name.
Parameters:
modTransform
- the AffineTransform to prepend to the
        current usr2dev transform.
concatenateTransform
public
void
concatenateTransform
(

 transform.  In matrix notation the operation is:
[this] = [this] x [modTransform]
Parameters:
modTransform
- the AffineTransform to append to the
        current usr2dev transform.
Since:
