ImageProducer
The interface for objects which can produce the image data for Images.
 Each image contains an ImageProducer which is used to reconstruct
 the image whenever it is needed, for example, when a new size of the
 Image is scaled, or when the width or height of the Image is being
 requested.

ImageConsumer

Abstract Methods
Modifier and Type
Method
Description
void
addConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Registers an
ImageConsumer
with the
ImageProducer
for access to the image data
 during a later reconstruction of the
Image
.
boolean
isConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Determines if a specified
ImageConsumer
object is currently registered with this
ImageProducer
as one of its consumers.
void
removeConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Removes the specified
ImageConsumer
object
 from the list of consumers currently registered to
 receive image data.
void
requestTopDownLeftRightResend
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Requests, on behalf of the
ImageConsumer
,
 that the
ImageProducer
attempt to resend
 the image data one more time in TOPDOWNLEFTRIGHT order
 so that higher quality conversion algorithms which
 depend on receiving pixels in order can be used to
 produce a better output version of the image.
void
startProduction
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Registers the specified
ImageConsumer
object
 as a consumer and starts an immediate reconstruction of
 the image data which will then be delivered to this
 consumer and any other consumer which might have already
 been registered with the producer.
Method Details
addConsumer
void
addConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Registers an
ImageConsumer
with the
ImageProducer
for access to the image data
 during a later reconstruction of the
Image
.
 The
ImageProducer
may, at its discretion,
 start delivering the image data to the consumer
 using the
ImageConsumer
interface immediately,
 or when the next available image reconstruction is triggered
 by a call to the
startProduction
method.
Parameters:
ic
- the specified
ImageConsumer
See Also:
startProduction(java.awt.image.ImageConsumer)
isConsumer
boolean
isConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Determines if a specified
ImageConsumer
object is currently registered with this
ImageProducer
as one of its consumers.
Parameters:
ic
- the specified
ImageConsumer
Returns:
true
if the specified
ImageConsumer
is registered with
         this
ImageProducer
;
false
otherwise.
removeConsumer
void
removeConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Removes the specified
ImageConsumer
object
 from the list of consumers currently registered to
 receive image data.  It is not considered an error
 to remove a consumer that is not currently registered.
 The
ImageProducer
should stop sending data
 to this consumer as soon as is feasible.
Parameters:
ic
- the specified
ImageConsumer
startProduction
void
startProduction
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Registers the specified
ImageConsumer
object
 as a consumer and starts an immediate reconstruction of
 the image data which will then be delivered to this
 consumer and any other consumer which might have already
 been registered with the producer.  This method differs
 from the addConsumer method in that a reproduction of
 the image data should be triggered as soon as possible.
Parameters:
ic
- the specified
ImageConsumer
See Also:
addConsumer(java.awt.image.ImageConsumer)
requestTopDownLeftRightResend
void
requestTopDownLeftRightResend
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Requests, on behalf of the
ImageConsumer
,
 that the
ImageProducer
attempt to resend
 the image data one more time in TOPDOWNLEFTRIGHT order
 so that higher quality conversion algorithms which
 depend on receiving pixels in order can be used to
 produce a better output version of the image.  The
ImageProducer
is free to
 ignore this call if it cannot resend the data in that
 order.  If the data can be resent, the
ImageProducer
should respond by executing
 the following minimum set of
ImageConsumer
method calls:
ic.setHints(TOPDOWNLEFTRIGHT | < otherhints >);
  ic.setPixels(...);      // As many times as needed
  ic.imageComplete();
Parameters:
ic
- the specified
ImageConsumer
See Also:
ImageConsumer.setHints(int)
