Interface MultiResolutionImage
All Known Implementing Classes:
AbstractMultiResolutionImage
,
BaseMultiResolutionImage
public interface
MultiResolutionImage
This interface is designed to be an optional additional API supported by
 some implementations of
Image
to allow them to provide
 alternate images for various rendering resolutions. The various
Graphics.drawImage(...)
variant methods will consult the methods
 of this interface if it is implemented on the argument
Image
object
 in order to choose the best representation to use for each rendering operation.
The
MultiResolutionImage
interface should be implemented by any
 subclass of
java.awt.Image
whose instances are intended to provide
 image resolution variants according to the given image width and height.
 For convenience, toolkit images obtained from
Toolkit.getImage(String name)
and
Toolkit.getImage(URL url)
will implement this interface on platforms that support naming conventions
 for resolution variants of stored image media and the
AbstractMultiResolutionImage
and
BaseMultiResolutionImage
classes are provided to facilitate easy construction of custom multi-resolution
 images from a list of related images.

Method Details
getResolutionVariant
Image
getResolutionVariant
(double destImageWidth,
 double destImageHeight)
Gets a specific image that is the best variant to represent
 this logical image at the indicated size.
Parameters:
destImageWidth
- the width of the destination image, in pixels.
destImageHeight
- the height of the destination image, in pixels.
Returns:
image resolution variant.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException

getResolutionVariants
List
<
Image
>
getResolutionVariants
()
Gets a readable list of all resolution variants.
 The list must be nonempty and contain at least one resolution variant.
Note that many implementations might return an unmodifiable list.
Returns:
list of resolution variants.
