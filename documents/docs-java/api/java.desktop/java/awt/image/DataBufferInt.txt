Class DataBufferInt
java.lang.Object
java.awt.image.DataBuffer
java.awt.image.DataBufferInt
public final class
DataBufferInt
extends
DataBuffer
This class extends
DataBuffer
and stores data internally
 as integers.
Note that some implementations may function more efficiently
 if they can maintain control over how the data for an image is
 stored.
 For example, optimizations such as caching an image in video
 memory require that the implementation track all modifications
 to that data.
 Other implementations may operate better if they can store the
 data in locations other than a Java array.
 To maintain optimum compatibility with various optimizations
 it is best to avoid constructors and methods which expose the
 underlying storage as a Java array as noted below in the
 documentation for those methods.

- The size of the
DataBuffer
.
DataBufferInt
public
DataBufferInt
(int size,
 int numBanks)
Constructs an integer-based
DataBuffer
with the specified number of
 banks, all of which are the specified size.
Parameters:

.
DataBufferInt
public
DataBufferInt
(int[] dataArray,
 int size)
Constructs an integer-based
DataBuffer
with a single bank using the
 specified array.
 Only the first
size
elements should be used by accessors of
 this
DataBuffer
.
dataArray
must be large enough to
 hold
size
elements.
Note that
DataBuffer
objects created by this constructor
 may be incompatible with
performance
 optimizations
used by some implementations (such as caching
 an associated image in video memory).
Parameters:
dataArray
- The integer array for the
DataBuffer
.
size
- The size of the
DataBuffer
bank.
DataBufferInt
public
DataBufferInt
(int[] dataArray,
 int size,
 int offset)
Constructs an integer-based
DataBuffer
with a single bank using the
 specified array, size, and offset.
dataArray
must have at least
offset
+
size
elements.  Only elements
offset
through
offset
+
size
- 1
 should be used by accessors of this
DataBuffer
.
Note that
DataBuffer
objects created by this constructor
 may be incompatible with
performance
 optimizations
used by some implementations (such as caching
 an associated image in video memory).
Parameters:
dataArray
- The integer array for the
DataBuffer
.
size
- The size of the
DataBuffer
bank.
offset
- The offset into the
dataArray
.
DataBufferInt
public
DataBufferInt
(int[][] dataArray,
 int size)
Constructs an integer-based
DataBuffer
