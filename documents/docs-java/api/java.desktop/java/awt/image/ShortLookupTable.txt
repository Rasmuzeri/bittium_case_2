Class ShortLookupTable
java.lang.Object
java.awt.image.LookupTable
java.awt.image.ShortLookupTable
public class
ShortLookupTable
extends
LookupTable
This class defines a lookup table object.  The output of a
 lookup operation using an object of this class is interpreted
 as an unsigned short quantity.  The lookup table contains short
 data arrays for one or more bands (or components) of an image,
 and it contains an offset which will be subtracted from the
 input values before indexing the arrays.  This allows an array
 smaller than the native data size to be provided for a
 constrained input.  If there is only one array in the lookup
 table, it will be applied to all bands.

ShortLookupTable
public
ShortLookupTable
(int offset,
 short[][] data)
Constructs a ShortLookupTable object from an array of short
 arrays representing a lookup table for each
 band.  The offset will be subtracted from the input
 values before indexing into the arrays.  The number of
 bands is the length of the data argument.  The
 data array for each band is stored as a reference.
Parameters:
offset
- the value subtracted from the input values
        before indexing into the arrays
data
- an array of short arrays representing a lookup
        table for each band
ShortLookupTable
public
ShortLookupTable
(int offset,
 short[] data)
Constructs a ShortLookupTable object from an array
 of shorts representing a lookup table for each
 band.  The offset will be subtracted from the input
 values before indexing into the array.  The
 data array is stored as a reference.
Parameters:
offset
- the value subtracted from the input values
        before indexing into the arrays
data
- an array of shorts
Method Details
getTable
public final
short[][]
getTable
()
Returns the lookup table data by reference.  If this ShortLookupTable
 was constructed using a single short array, the length of the returned
 array is one.
Returns:
ShortLookupTable data array.
lookupPixel
public
int[]
lookupPixel
(int[] src,
 int[] dst)
Returns an array of samples of a pixel, translated with the lookup
 table. The source and destination array can be the same array.
 Array
dst
is returned.
Specified by:
lookupPixel
in class
LookupTable
Parameters:
src
- the source array.
dst
- the destination array. This array must be at least as
         long as
src
.  If
dst
is
null
, a new array will be allocated having the
         same length as
src
.
Returns:
the array
dst
, an
int
array of
         samples.
Throws:
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
- if
src
is
            longer than
dst
or if for any element
i
of
src
,
(src[i]&0xffff)-offset
is either less than
            zero or greater than or equal to the length of the
            lookup table for any band.
lookupPixel
public
short[]
lookupPixel
(short[] src,
 short[] dst)
Returns an array of samples of a pixel, translated with the lookup
 table. The source and destination array can be the same array.
 Array
dst
is returned.
Parameters:
src
- the source array.
dst
- the destination array. This array must be at least as
         long as
src
.  If
dst
is
null
, a new array will be allocated having the
         same length as
src
.
Returns:
the array
dst
, an
int
array of
         samples.
Throws:
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
- if
src
is
            longer than
dst
or if for any element
i
of
src
,
(src[i]&0xffff)-offset
is either less than
            zero or greater than or equal to the length of the
            lookup table for any band.
