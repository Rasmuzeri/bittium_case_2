public class
CropImageFilter
extends
ImageFilter
An ImageFilter class for cropping images.
 This class extends the basic ImageFilter Class to extract a given
 rectangular region of an existing Image and provide a source for a
 new image containing just the extracted region.  It is meant to
 be used in conjunction with a FilteredImageSource object to produce
 cropped versions of existing images.

Constructor Details
CropImageFilter
public
CropImageFilter
(int x,
 int y,
 int w,
 int h)
Constructs a CropImageFilter that extracts the absolute rectangular
 region of pixels from its source Image as specified by the x, y,
 w, and h parameters.
Parameters:
x
- the x location of the top of the rectangle to be extracted
y
- the y location of the top of the rectangle to be extracted
w
- the width of the rectangle to be extracted
h
- the height of the rectangle to be extracted
Method Details
setProperties
public
void
setProperties
(
Hashtable
<?,
?> props)
Passes along  the properties from the source object after adding a
 property indicating the cropped region.
 This method invokes
super.setProperties
,
 which might result in additional properties being added.
Note: This method is intended to be called by the
ImageProducer
of the
Image
whose pixels
 are being filtered. Developers using
 this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling
 this method directly since that operation could interfere
 with the filtering operation.
Specified by:
setProperties
in interface
ImageConsumer
Overrides:
setProperties
in class
ImageFilter
Parameters:
props
- the properties from the source object
setDimensions
public
void
setDimensions
(int w,
 int h)
Override the source image's dimensions and pass the dimensions
 of the rectangular cropped region to the ImageConsumer.
Note: This method is intended to be called by the
ImageProducer
of the
Image
whose
 pixels are being filtered. Developers using
 this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling
 this method directly since that operation could interfere
 with the filtering operation.
Specified by:
setDimensions
in interface
ImageConsumer
Overrides:
setDimensions
in class
ImageFilter
Parameters:
w
- the width of the source image
h
- the height of the source image

void
setPixels
(int x,
 int y,
 int w,
 int h,
ColorModel
model,
 byte[] pixels,
 int off,
 int scansize)
Determine whether the delivered byte pixels intersect the region to
 be extracted and passes through only that subset of pixels that
 appear in the output region.
Note: This method is intended to be called by the
ImageProducer
of the
Image
whose
 pixels are being filtered. Developers using
 this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling
 this method directly since that operation could interfere
 with the filtering operation.
Specified by:
setPixels
in interface
ImageConsumer
Overrides:
setPixels
in class
ImageFilter
Parameters:
x
- the X coordinate of the upper-left corner of the
        area of pixels to be set
y
- the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner of the
        area of pixels to be set
w
- the width of the area of pixels
h
- the height of the area of pixels
model
- the specified
ColorModel
pixels
- the array of pixels
off
- the offset into the
pixels
array
scansize
- the distance from one row of pixels to the next in
 the
pixels
array
