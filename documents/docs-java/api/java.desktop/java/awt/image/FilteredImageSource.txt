Class FilteredImageSource
java.lang.Object
java.awt.image.FilteredImageSource
All Implemented Interfaces:
ImageProducer
public class
FilteredImageSource
extends
Object
implements
ImageProducer
This class is an implementation of the ImageProducer interface which
 takes an existing image and a filter object and uses them to produce
 image data for a new filtered version of the original image. Furthermore,
FilteredImageSource
is safe for use by multiple threads.
 Here is an example which filters an image by swapping the red and
 blue components:
Image src = getImage("doc:///demo/images/duke/T1.gif");
      ImageFilter colorfilter = new RedBlueSwapFilter();
      Image img = createImage(new FilteredImageSource(src.getSource(),
                                                      colorfilter));

Constructor Details
FilteredImageSource
public
FilteredImageSource
(
ImageProducer
orig,
ImageFilter
imgf)
Constructs an ImageProducer object from an existing ImageProducer
 and a filter object.
Parameters:
orig
- the specified
ImageProducer
imgf
- the specified
ImageFilter
See Also:
ImageFilter
Component.createImage(java.awt.image.ImageProducer)
Method Details
addConsumer
public
void
addConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Adds the specified
ImageConsumer
to the list of consumers interested in data for the filtered image.
 An instance of the original
ImageFilter
is created
 (using the filter's
getFilterInstance
method)
 to manipulate the image data
 for the specified
ImageConsumer
.
 The newly created filter instance
 is then passed to the
addConsumer
method
 of the original
ImageProducer
.
This method is public as a side effect
 of this class implementing
 the
ImageProducer
interface.
 It should not be called from user code,
 and its behavior if called from user code is unspecified.
Specified by:
addConsumer
in interface
ImageProducer
Parameters:
ic
- the consumer for the filtered image
See Also:
ImageConsumer
isConsumer
public
boolean
isConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Determines whether an ImageConsumer is on the list of consumers
 currently interested in data for this image.
This method is public as a side effect
 of this class implementing
 the
ImageProducer
interface.
 It should not be called from user code,
 and its behavior if called from user code is unspecified.
Specified by:
isConsumer
in interface
ImageProducer
Parameters:
ic
- the specified
ImageConsumer
Returns:
true if the ImageConsumer is on the list; false otherwise

ImageConsumer
removeConsumer
public
void
removeConsumer
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Removes an ImageConsumer from the list of consumers interested in
 data for this image.
This method is public as a side effect
 of this class implementing
 the
ImageProducer
interface.
 It should not be called from user code,
 and its behavior if called from user code is unspecified.
Specified by:
removeConsumer
in interface
ImageProducer
Parameters:
ic
- the specified
ImageConsumer
See Also:
ImageConsumer
startProduction
public
void
startProduction
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Starts production of the filtered image.
 If the specified
ImageConsumer
isn't already a consumer of the filtered image,
 an instance of the original
ImageFilter
is created
 (using the filter's
getFilterInstance
method)
 to manipulate the image data
 for the
ImageConsumer
.
 The filter instance for the
ImageConsumer
is then passed to the
startProduction
method
 of the original
ImageProducer
.
This method is public as a side effect
 of this class implementing
 the
ImageProducer
interface.
 It should not be called from user code,
 and its behavior if called from user code is unspecified.
Specified by:
startProduction
in interface
ImageProducer
Parameters:
ic
- the consumer for the filtered image
See Also:
ImageConsumer
requestTopDownLeftRightResend
public
void
requestTopDownLeftRightResend
(
ImageConsumer
ic)
Requests that a given ImageConsumer have the image data delivered
 one more time in top-down, left-right order.  The request is
 handed to the ImageFilter for further processing, since the
 ability to preserve the pixel ordering depends on the filter.
This method is public as a side effect
 of this class implementing
 the
ImageProducer
interface.
 It should not be called from user code,
 and its behavior if called from user code is unspecified.
Specified by:
requestTopDownLeftRightResend
in interface
ImageProducer
Parameters:
ic
- the specified
ImageConsumer
