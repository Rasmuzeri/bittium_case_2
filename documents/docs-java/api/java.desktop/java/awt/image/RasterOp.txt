public interface
RasterOp
This interface describes single-input/single-output
 operations performed on Raster objects.  It is implemented by such
 classes as AffineTransformOp, ConvolveOp, and LookupOp.  The Source
 and Destination objects must contain the appropriate number
 of bands for the particular classes implementing this interface.
 Otherwise, an exception is thrown.  This interface cannot be used to
 describe more sophisticated Ops such as ones that take multiple sources.
 Each class implementing this interface will specify whether or not it
 will allow an in-place filtering operation (i.e. source object equal
 to the destination object).  Note that the restriction to single-input
 operations means that the values of destination pixels prior to the
 operation are not used as input to the filter operation.

Method Details
filter
WritableRaster
filter
(
Raster
src,
WritableRaster
dest)
Performs a single-input/single-output operation from a source Raster
 to a destination Raster.  If the destination Raster is null, a
 new Raster will be created.  The IllegalArgumentException may be thrown
 if the source and/or destination Raster is incompatible with the types
 of Rasters allowed by the class implementing this filter.
Parameters:
src
- the source
Raster
dest
- the destination
WritableRaster
Returns:
a
WritableRaster
that represents the result of
         the filtering operation.
getBounds2D
Rectangle2D
getBounds2D
(
Raster
src)
Returns the bounding box of the filtered destination Raster.
 The IllegalArgumentException may be thrown if the source Raster
 is incompatible with the types of Rasters allowed
 by the class implementing this filter.
Parameters:
src
- the source
Raster
Returns:
a
Rectangle2D
that is the bounding box of
         the
Raster
resulting from the filtering
         operation.
createCompatibleDestRaster
WritableRaster
createCompatibleDestRaster
(
Raster
src)
Creates a zeroed destination Raster with the correct size and number of
 bands.
 The IllegalArgumentException may be thrown if the source Raster
 is incompatible with the types of Rasters allowed
 by the class implementing this filter.
Parameters:
src
- the source
Raster
Returns:
a
WritableRaster
that is compatible with
src
getPoint2D
Point2D
getPoint2D
(
Point2D
srcPt,
Point2D
dstPt)
Returns the location of the destination point given a
 point in the source Raster.  If dstPt is non-null, it
 will be used to hold the return value.
Parameters:
srcPt
- the source
Point2D
dstPt
- the destination
Point2D
Returns:
the location of the destination point.
getRenderingHints
RenderingHints
getRenderingHints
()
Returns the rendering hints for this RasterOp.  Returns
 null if no hints have been set.
Returns:
the
RenderingHints
object of this
RasterOp
