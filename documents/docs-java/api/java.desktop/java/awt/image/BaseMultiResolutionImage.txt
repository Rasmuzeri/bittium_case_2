Class BaseMultiResolutionImage
java.lang.Object
java.awt.Image
java.awt.image.AbstractMultiResolutionImage
java.awt.image.BaseMultiResolutionImage
All Implemented Interfaces:
MultiResolutionImage
public class
BaseMultiResolutionImage
extends
AbstractMultiResolutionImage
This class is an array-based implementation of
 the
AbstractMultiResolutionImage
class.

 This class will implement the
getResolutionVariant(double destImageWidth, double destImageHeight)
method using a simple algorithm which will return the first image variant
 in the array that is large enough to satisfy the rendering request. The
 last image in the array will be returned if no suitable image is found
 that is as large as the rendering request.
For best effect the array of images should be sorted with each image being
 both wider and taller than the previous image.  The base image need not be
 the first image in the array. No exception will be thrown if the images
 are not sorted as suggested.
