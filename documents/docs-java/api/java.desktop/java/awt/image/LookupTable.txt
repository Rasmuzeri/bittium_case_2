Class LookupTable
java.lang.Object
java.awt.image.LookupTable
Direct Known Subclasses:
ByteLookupTable
,
ShortLookupTable
public abstract class
LookupTable
extends
Object
This abstract class defines a lookup table object.  ByteLookupTable
 and ShortLookupTable are subclasses, which
 contain byte and short data, respectively.  A lookup table
 contains data arrays for one or more bands (or components) of an image
 (for example, separate arrays for R, G, and B),
 and it contains an offset which will be subtracted from the
 input values before indexing into the arrays.  This allows an array
 smaller than the native data size to be provided for a
 constrained input.  If there is only one array in the lookup
 table, it will be applied to all bands.  All arrays must be the
 same size.

Constructor Details
LookupTable
protected
LookupTable
(int offset,
 int numComponents)
Constructs a new LookupTable from the number of components and an offset
 into the lookup table.
Parameters:
offset
- the offset to subtract from input values before indexing
        into the data arrays for this
LookupTable
numComponents
- the number of data arrays in this
LookupTable
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
offset
is less than 0
         or if
numComponents
is less than 1
Method Details
getNumComponents
public
int
getNumComponents
()
Returns the number of components in the lookup table.
Returns:
the number of components in this
LookupTable
.
getOffset
public
int
getOffset
()
Returns the offset.
Returns:
the offset of this
LookupTable
.
lookupPixel
public abstract
int[]
lookupPixel
(int[] src,
 int[] dest)
Returns an
int
array of components for
 one pixel.  The
dest
array contains the
 result of the lookup and is returned.  If dest is
null
, a new array is allocated.  The
 source and destination can be equal.
Parameters:
src
- the source array of components of one pixel
dest
- the destination array of components for one pixel,
        translated with this
LookupTable
Returns:
an
int
array of components for one
         pixel.
