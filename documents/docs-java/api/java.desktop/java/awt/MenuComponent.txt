Class MenuComponent

java.awt.MenuComponent
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
Direct Known Subclasses:
MenuBar
,
MenuItem
public abstract class
MenuComponent
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
The abstract class
MenuComponent
is the superclass
 of all menu-related components. In this respect, the class
MenuComponent
is analogous to the abstract superclass
Component
for AWT components.
Menu components receive and process AWT events, just as components do,
 through the method
processEvent
.
Since:
1.0

getParent
()
Returns the parent container for this menu component.
Returns:
the menu component containing this menu component,

if this menu component
                 is the outermost component, the menu bar itself
getFont
public
Font
getFont
()
Gets the font used for this menu component.
Returns:

null
otherwise
See Also:
setFont(java.awt.Font)
setFont
public
void
setFont
(
Font
f)
Sets the font to be used for this menu component to the specified
 font. This font is also used by all subcomponents of this menu
 component, unless those subcomponents specify a different font.
Some platforms may not support setting of all font attributes
 of a menu component; in such cases, calling
setFont
will have no effect on the unsupported font attributes of this
 menu component.  Unless subcomponents of this menu component
 specify a different font, this font will be used by those
 subcomponents if supported by the underlying platform.
Parameters:
f
- the font to be set
See Also:
getFont()
Font.getAttributes()
TextAttribute
removeNotify
public
void
removeNotify
()
Removes the menu component's peer.  The peer allows us to modify the
 appearance of the menu component without changing the functionality of
 the menu component.
