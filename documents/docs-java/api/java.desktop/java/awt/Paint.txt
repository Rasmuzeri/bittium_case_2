public interface
Paint
extends
Transparency
This
Paint
interface defines how color patterns
 can be generated for
Graphics2D
operations.  A class
 implementing the
Paint
interface is added to the
Graphics2D
context in order to define the color
 pattern used by the
draw
and
fill
methods.
Instances of classes implementing
Paint
must be
 read-only because the
Graphics2D
does not clone
 these objects when they are set as an attribute with the
setPaint
method or when the
Graphics2D
object is itself cloned.

PaintContext
createContext
(
ColorModel
cm,
Rectangle
deviceBounds,
Rectangle2D
userBounds,
AffineTransform

RenderingHints
hints)
Creates and returns a
PaintContext
used to
 generate the color pattern.
 The arguments to this method convey additional information
 about the rendering operation that may be
 used or ignored on various implementations of the
Paint
interface.
 A caller must pass non-
null
values for all of the arguments
 except for the
ColorModel
argument which may be
null
to
 indicate that no specific
ColorModel
type is preferred.
 Implementations of the
Paint
interface are allowed to use or ignore
 any of the arguments as makes sense for their function, and are
 not constrained to use the specified
ColorModel
for the returned
PaintContext
, even if it is not
null
.
 Implementations are allowed to throw
NullPointerException
for
 any
null
argument other than the
ColorModel
argument,
 but are not required to do so.
Parameters:
cm
- the preferred
ColorModel
which represents the most convenient
           format for the caller to receive the pixel data, or
null
if there is no preference.
deviceBounds
- the device space bounding box
                     of the graphics primitive being rendered.
                     Implementations of the
Paint
interface
                     are allowed to throw
NullPointerException
for a
null deviceBounds
.
userBounds
- the user space bounding box
                   of the graphics primitive being rendered.
                     Implementations of the
Paint
interface
                     are allowed to throw
NullPointerException
for a
null userBounds
.
xform
- the
AffineTransform
from user
              space into device space.
                     Implementations of the
Paint
interface
                     are allowed to throw
NullPointerException
for a
null xform
.
hints
- the set of hints that the context object can use to
              choose between rendering alternatives.
                     Implementations of the
Paint
interface
                     are allowed to throw
NullPointerException
for a
null hints
.
Returns:
the
PaintContext
for
         generating color patterns.
