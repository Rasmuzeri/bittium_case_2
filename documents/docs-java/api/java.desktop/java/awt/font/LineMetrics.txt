Class LineMetrics
java.lang.Object
java.awt.font.LineMetrics
public abstract class
LineMetrics
extends
Object
The
LineMetrics
class allows access to the
 metrics needed to layout characters along a line
 and to layout of a set of lines.  A
LineMetrics
object encapsulates the measurement information associated
 with a run of text.
Fonts can have different metrics for different ranges of
 characters.  The
getLineMetrics
methods of
Font
take some text as an argument
 and return a
LineMetrics
object describing the
 metrics of the initial number of characters in that text, as
 returned by
getNumChars()
.

Method Details
getNumChars
public abstract
int
getNumChars
()
Returns the number of characters (
char
values) in the text whose
 metrics are encapsulated by this
LineMetrics
object.
Returns:
the number of characters (
char
values) in the text with which
         this
LineMetrics
was created.
getAscent
public abstract
float
getAscent
()
Returns the ascent of the text.  The ascent
 is the distance from the baseline
 to the ascender line.  The ascent usually represents the
 the height of the capital letters of the text.  Some characters
 can extend above the ascender line.
Returns:
the ascent of the text.
getDescent
public abstract
float
getDescent
()
Returns the descent of the text.  The descent
 is the distance from the baseline
 to the descender line.  The descent usually represents
 the distance to the bottom of lower case letters like
 'p'.  Some characters can extend below the descender
 line.
Returns:
the descent of the text.
getLeading
public abstract
float
getLeading
()
Returns the leading of the text. The
 leading is the recommended
 distance from the bottom of the descender line to the
 top of the next line.
Returns:
the leading of the text.
getHeight
public abstract
float
getHeight
()
Returns the height of the text.  The
 height is equal to the sum of the ascent, the
 descent and the leading.
Returns:
the height of the text.
getBaselineIndex
public abstract
int
getBaselineIndex
()
Returns the baseline index of the text.
 The index is one of
ROMAN_BASELINE
,
CENTER_BASELINE
,
HANGING_BASELINE
.
Returns:
the baseline of the text.
getBaselineOffsets
public abstract
float[]
getBaselineOffsets
()
Returns the baseline offsets of the text,
 relative to the baseline of the text.  The
 offsets are indexed by baseline index.  For
 example, if the baseline index is
CENTER_BASELINE
then
offsets[HANGING_BASELINE]
is usually
 negative,
offsets[CENTER_BASELINE]
is zero, and
offsets[ROMAN_BASELINE]
is usually positive.
Returns:
the baseline offsets of the text.
getStrikethroughOffset
public abstract
float
getStrikethroughOffset
()
Returns the position of the strike-through line
 relative to the baseline.
Returns:
the position of the strike-through line.
getStrikethroughThickness
public abstract
float
getStrikethroughThickness
()
Returns the thickness of the strike-through line.
Returns:
the thickness of the strike-through line.
getUnderlineOffset
public abstract
float
getUnderlineOffset
()
Returns the position of the underline relative to
 the baseline.
Returns:
the position of the underline.
getUnderlineThickness
public abstract
float
getUnderlineThickness
()
Returns the thickness of the underline.
Returns:
the thickness of the underline.
