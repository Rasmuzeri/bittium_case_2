Class GraphicAttribute
java.lang.Object
java.awt.font.GraphicAttribute
Direct Known Subclasses:
ImageGraphicAttribute
,
ShapeGraphicAttribute
public abstract class
GraphicAttribute
extends
Object
This class is used with the CHAR_REPLACEMENT attribute.
The
GraphicAttribute
class represents a graphic embedded
 in text. Clients subclass this class to implement their own char
 replacement graphics.  Clients wishing to embed shapes and images in
 text need not subclass this class.  Instead, clients can use the
ShapeGraphicAttribute
and
ImageGraphicAttribute
classes.
Subclasses must ensure that their objects are immutable once they
 are constructed.  Mutating a
GraphicAttribute
that
 is used in a
TextLayout
results in undefined behavior from the
TextLayout
.

Constructor Details
GraphicAttribute
protected
GraphicAttribute
(int alignment)
Constructs a
GraphicAttribute
.
 Subclasses use this to define the alignment of the graphic.
Parameters:
alignment
- an int representing one of the
GraphicAttribute
alignment fields
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if alignment is not one of the
 five defined values.
Method Details
getAscent
public abstract
float
getAscent
()
Returns the ascent of this
GraphicAttribute
.  A
 graphic can be rendered above its ascent.
Returns:
the ascent of this
GraphicAttribute
.
See Also:
getBounds()
getDescent
public abstract
float
getDescent
()
Returns the descent of this
GraphicAttribute
.  A
 graphic can be rendered below its descent.
Returns:
the descent of this
GraphicAttribute
.
See Also:
getBounds()
getAdvance
public abstract
float
getAdvance
()
Returns the advance of this
GraphicAttribute
.  The
GraphicAttribute
object's advance is the distance
 from the point at which the graphic is rendered and the point where
 the next character or graphic is rendered.  A graphic can be
 rendered beyond its advance
Returns:
the advance of this
GraphicAttribute
.
See Also:
getBounds()
getBounds
public
Rectangle2D
getBounds
()
Returns a
Rectangle2D
that encloses all of the
 bits drawn by this
GraphicAttribute
relative to the
 rendering position.
 A graphic may be rendered beyond its origin, ascent, descent,
 or advance;  but if it is, this method's implementation must
 indicate where the graphic is rendered.
 Default bounds is the rectangle (0, -ascent, advance, ascent+descent).
Returns:
a
Rectangle2D
that encloses all of the bits
 rendered by this
GraphicAttribute
.
getOutline
public
Shape
getOutline
(
AffineTransform
tx)
Return a
Shape
that represents the region that
 this
GraphicAttribute
renders.  This is used when a
TextLayout
is requested to return the outline of the text.
 The (untransformed) shape must not extend outside the rectangular
 bounds returned by
getBounds
.
 The default implementation returns the rectangle returned by
getBounds()
, transformed by the provided
AffineTransform
if present.
Parameters:
tx
- an optional
AffineTransform
to apply to the
   outline of this
GraphicAttribute
. This can be null.
Returns:
a
Shape
representing this graphic attribute,
   suitable for stroking or filling.
Since:
1.6
draw
public abstract
void
draw
(
Graphics2D
graphics,
 float x,
 float y)
Renders this
GraphicAttribute
at the specified
 location.
Parameters:
graphics
- the
Graphics2D
into which to render the
 graphic
x
- the user-space X coordinate where the graphic is rendered
y
- the user-space Y coordinate where the graphic is rendered
getAlignment
public final
int
getAlignment
()
Returns the alignment of this
GraphicAttribute
.
 Alignment can be to a particular baseline, or to the absolute top
 or bottom of a line.
Returns:
the alignment of this
GraphicAttribute
.
getJustificationInfo
public
GlyphJustificationInfo
getJustificationInfo
()
Returns the justification information for this
GraphicAttribute
.  Subclasses
 can override this method to provide different justification
 information.
Returns:
a
GlyphJustificationInfo
object that contains the
 justification information for this
GraphicAttribute
.
