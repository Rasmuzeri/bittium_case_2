Class TransformAttribute
java.lang.Object
java.awt.font.TransformAttribute
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public final class
TransformAttribute
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
The
TransformAttribute
class provides an immutable
 wrapper for a transform so that it is safe to use as an attribute.

IDENTITY
public static final
TransformAttribute
IDENTITY
A
TransformAttribute
representing the identity transform.
Since:
1.6
Constructor Details
TransformAttribute
public
TransformAttribute
(
AffineTransform
transform)
Wraps the specified transform.  The transform is cloned and a
 reference to the clone is kept.  The original transform is unchanged.
 If null is passed as the argument, this constructor behaves as though
 it were the identity transform.  (Note that it is preferable to use
IDENTITY
in this case.)
Parameters:
transform
- the specified
AffineTransform
to be wrapped,
 or null.
Method Details
getTransform
public
AffineTransform
getTransform
()
Returns a copy of the wrapped transform.
Returns:
an
AffineTransform
that is a copy of the wrapped
 transform of this
TransformAttribute
.
isIdentity
public
boolean
isIdentity
()
Returns
true
if the wrapped transform is
 an identity transform.
Returns:
true
if the wrapped transform is
 an identity transform;
false
otherwise.
Since:
1.4
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Description copied from class:
Object
Returns a hash code value for the object. This method is
 supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by
HashMap
.
The general contract of
hashCode
is:
Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during
     an execution of a Java application, the
hashCode
method
     must consistently return the same integer, provided no information
     used in
equals
comparisons on the object is modified.
     This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
     application to another execution of the same application.
If two objects are equal according to the
equals
method, then calling the
hashCode
method on each of the two objects must produce the
     same integer result.
It is
not
required that if two objects are unequal
     according to the
equals
method, then
     calling the
hashCode
method on each of the two objects
     must produce distinct integer results.  However, the programmer
     should be aware that producing distinct integer results for
     unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
a hash code value for this object.

Returns
true

's
 transform.
Overrides:

Parameters:
rhs
- the object to compare to
Returns:
