Interface AWTEventListener

public interface
AWTEventListener
extends
EventListener
The listener interface for receiving notification of events
 dispatched to objects that are instances of Component or
 MenuComponent or their subclasses.  Unlike the other EventListeners
 in this package, AWTEventListeners passively observe events
 being dispatched in the AWT, system-wide.  Most applications
 should never use this class; applications which might use
 AWTEventListeners include event recorders for automated testing,
 and facilities such as the Java Accessibility package.
The class that is interested in monitoring AWT events
 implements this interface, and the object created with that
 class is registered with the Toolkit, using the Toolkit's
addAWTEventListener
method.  When an event is
 dispatched anywhere in the AWT, that object's
eventDispatched
method is invoked.
