public interface
ItemListener
extends
EventListener
The listener interface for receiving item events.
 The class that is interested in processing an item event
 implements this interface. The object created with that
 class is then registered with a component using the
 component's
addItemListener
method. When an
 item-selection event occurs, the listener object's
itemStateChanged
method is invoked.
