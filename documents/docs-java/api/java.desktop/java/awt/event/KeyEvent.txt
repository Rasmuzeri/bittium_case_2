public non-sealed class
KeyEvent
extends
InputEvent
An event which indicates that a keystroke occurred in a component.
This low-level event is generated by a component object (such as a text
 field) when a key is pressed, released, or typed.
 The event is passed to every
KeyListener
or
KeyAdapter
object which registered to receive such
 events using the component's
addKeyListener
method.
 (
KeyAdapter
objects implement the
KeyListener
interface.)  Each such listener object
 gets this
KeyEvent
when the event occurs.
"Key typed" events
are higher-level and generally do not depend on
 the platform or keyboard layout.  They are generated when a Unicode character
 is entered, and are the preferred way to find out about character input.
 In the simplest case, a key typed event is produced by a single key press
 (e.g., 'a').  Often, however, characters are produced by series of key
 presses (e.g., 'shift' + 'a'), and the mapping from key pressed events to
 key typed events may be many-to-one or many-to-many.  Key releases are not
 usually necessary to generate a key typed event, but there are some cases
 where the key typed event is not generated until a key is released (e.g.,
 entering ASCII sequences via the Alt-Numpad method in Windows).
 No key typed events are generated for keys that don't generate Unicode
 characters (e.g., action keys, modifier keys, etc.).
The getKeyChar method always returns a valid Unicode character or
 CHAR_UNDEFINED.  Character input is reported by KEY_TYPED events:
 KEY_PRESSED and KEY_RELEASED events are not necessarily associated
 with character input.  Therefore, the result of the getKeyChar method
 is guaranteed to be meaningful only for KEY_TYPED events.
For key pressed and key released events, the getKeyCode method returns
 the event's keyCode.  For key typed events, the getKeyCode method
 always returns
VK_UNDEFINED
. The
getExtendedKeyCode
method
 may also be used with many international keyboard layouts.
"Key pressed" and "key released" events
are lower-level and depend
 on the platform and keyboard layout. They are generated whenever a key is
 pressed or released, and are the only way to find out about keys that don't
 generate character input (e.g., action keys, modifier keys, etc.). The key
 being pressed or released is indicated by the
getKeyCode
and
getExtendedKeyCode
methods, which return a virtual key code.
Virtual key codes
are used to report which keyboard key has
 been pressed, rather than a character generated by the combination
 of one or more keystrokes (such as "A", which comes from shift and "a").
For example, pressing the Shift key will cause a KEY_PRESSED event
 with a VK_SHIFT keyCode, while pressing the 'a' key will result in
 a VK_A keyCode.  After the 'a' key is released, a KEY_RELEASED event
 will be fired with VK_A. Separately, a KEY_TYPED event with a keyChar
 value of 'A' is generated.
Pressing and releasing a key on the keyboard results in the generating
 the following key events (in order):
KEY_PRESSED
KEY_TYPED
(is only generated if a valid Unicode character could be generated.)
KEY_RELEASED
But in some cases (e.g. auto-repeat or input method is activated) the order
 could be different (and platform dependent).
Notes:
Key combinations which do not result in Unicode characters, such as action
 keys like F1 and the HELP key, do not generate KEY_TYPED events.
Not all keyboards or systems are capable of generating all
 virtual key codes.  No attempt is made in Java to generate these keys
 artificially.
Virtual key codes do not identify a physical key: they depend on the
 platform and keyboard layout. For example, the key that generates VK_Q
 when using a U.S. keyboard layout will generate VK_A when using a French
 keyboard layout.
The key that generates
VK_Q
when using a U.S. keyboard layout also
 generates a unique code for Russian or Hebrew layout. There is no a
VK_
constant for these and many other codes in various layouts. These codes
 may be obtained by using
getExtendedKeyCode
and are used whenever
 a
VK_
constant is used.
Not all characters have a keycode associated with them.  For example,
 there is no keycode for the question mark because there is no keyboard
 for which it appears on the primary layer.
In order to support the platform-independent handling of action keys,
 the Java platform uses a few additional virtual key constants for functions
 that would otherwise have to be recognized by interpreting virtual key codes
 and modifiers. For example, for Japanese Windows keyboards, VK_ALL_CANDIDATES
 is returned instead of VK_CONVERT with the ALT modifier.
As specified in
Focus Specification
key events are dispatched to the focus owner by default.
WARNING: Aside from those keys that are defined by the Java language
 (VK_ENTER, VK_BACK_SPACE, and VK_TAB), do not rely on the values of the VK_
 constants.  The platform steward reserves the right to change these values as needed
 to accommodate a wider range of keyboards in the future.
An unspecified behavior will be caused if the
id
parameter
 of any particular
KeyEvent
instance is not
 in the range from
KEY_FIRST
to
KEY_LAST
.

Method Details
getKeyCode
public
int
getKeyCode
()
Returns the integer keyCode associated with the key in this event.
Returns:
the integer code for an actual key on the keyboard.
         (For
KEY_TYPED
events, the keyCode is
VK_UNDEFINED
.)
setKeyCode
public
void
setKeyCode
(int keyCode)
Set the keyCode value to indicate a physical key.
Parameters:
keyCode
- an integer corresponding to an actual key on the keyboard.
getKeyChar
public
char
getKeyChar
()
Returns the character associated with the key in this event.
 For example, the
KEY_TYPED
event for shift + "a"
 returns the value for "A".
KEY_PRESSED
and
KEY_RELEASED
events
 are not intended for reporting of character input.  Therefore,
 the values returned by this method are guaranteed to be
 meaningful only for
KEY_TYPED
events.
Returns:
the Unicode character defined for this key event.
         If no valid Unicode character exists for this key event,
CHAR_UNDEFINED
is returned.
setKeyChar
public
void
setKeyChar
(char keyChar)
Set the keyChar value to indicate a logical character.
Parameters:
keyChar
- a char corresponding to the combination of keystrokes
                that make up this event.
setModifiers
@Deprecated
public
void
setModifiers
(int modifiers)
Deprecated.
as of JDK1.1.4
Set the modifiers to indicate additional keys that were held down
 (e.g. shift, ctrl, alt, meta) defined as part of InputEvent.
NOTE:  use of this method is not recommended, because many AWT
 implementations do not recognize modifier changes.  This is
 especially true for
KEY_TYPED
events where the shift
 modifier is changed.
Parameters:
modifiers
- an integer combination of the modifier constants.
See Also:
InputEvent
getKeyLocation
public
int
getKeyLocation
()
Returns the location of the key that originated this key event.

 Some keys occur more than once on a keyboard, e.g. the left and
 right shift keys.  Additionally, some keys occur on the numeric
 keypad.  This provides a way of distinguishing such keys.
Returns:
the location of the key that was pressed or released.
         Always returns
KEY_LOCATION_UNKNOWN
for
KEY_TYPED
events.
Since:
1.4
getKeyText
public static
String
getKeyText
(int keyCode)
Returns a String describing the keyCode, such as "HOME", "F1" or "A".
 These strings can be localized by changing the awt.properties file.
Parameters:
keyCode
- the key whose description is to be returned
Returns:
a string containing a text description for a physical key,
         identified by its keyCode
getKeyModifiersText
@Deprecated
(
since
="9")
public static
String
getKeyModifiersText
(int modifiers)
Deprecated.
It is recommended that extended modifier keys and
InputEvent.getModifiersExText(int)
be used instead
Returns a
String
describing the modifier key(s),
 such as "Shift", or "Ctrl+Shift".  These strings can be
 localized by changing the
awt.properties
file.
Note that
InputEvent.ALT_MASK
and
InputEvent.BUTTON2_MASK
have the same value,
 so the string "Alt" is returned for both modifiers.  Likewise,
InputEvent.META_MASK
and
InputEvent.BUTTON3_MASK
have the same value,
 so the string "Meta" is returned for both modifiers.
Parameters:
modifiers
- the modifier mask to be processed
Returns:
string a text description of the combination of modifier
                keys that were held down during the event
See Also:
InputEvent.getModifiersExText(int)
isActionKey
public
boolean
isActionKey
()
Returns whether the key in this event is an "action" key.
 Typically an action key does not fire a unicode character and is
 not a modifier key.
Returns:
true
if the key is an "action" key,
false
otherwise
paramString
public
String
paramString
()
Returns a parameter string identifying this event.
 This method is useful for event logging and for debugging.
Overrides:
paramString
in class
ComponentEvent
Returns:
a string identifying the event and its attributes
getExtendedKeyCode
public
int
getExtendedKeyCode
()
Returns an extended key code for the event.
 The extended key code is a unique id assigned to  a key on the keyboard
 just like
keyCode
. However, unlike
keyCode
, this value depends on the
 current keyboard layout. For instance, pressing the left topmost letter key
 in a common English layout produces the same value as
keyCode
,
VK_Q
.
 Pressing the same key in a regular Russian layout gives another code, unique for the
 letter "Cyrillic I short".
Returns:
an extended key code for the event
Since:
1.7
getExtendedKeyCodeForChar
public static
int
getExtendedKeyCodeForChar
(int c)
Returns an extended key code for a unicode character.
Parameters:
c
- the unicode character to be processed
Returns:
for a unicode character with a corresponding
VK_
constant -- this
VK_
constant; for a character appearing on the primary
   level of a known keyboard layout -- a unique integer.
   If a character does not appear on the primary level of a known keyboard,
VK_UNDEFINED
is returned.
