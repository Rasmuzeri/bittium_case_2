public interface
KeyListener
extends
EventListener
The listener interface for receiving keyboard events (keystrokes).
 The class that is interested in processing a keyboard event
 either implements this interface (and all the methods it
 contains) or extends the abstract
KeyAdapter
class
 (overriding only the methods of interest).
The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 component using the component's
addKeyListener
method. A keyboard event is generated when a key is pressed, released,
 or typed. The relevant method in the listener
 object is then invoked, and the
KeyEvent
is passed to it.
