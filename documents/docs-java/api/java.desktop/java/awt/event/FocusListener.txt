public interface
FocusListener
extends
EventListener
The listener interface for receiving keyboard focus events on
 a component.
 The class that is interested in processing a focus event
 either implements this interface (and all the methods it
 contains) or extends the abstract
FocusAdapter
class
 (overriding only the methods of interest).
 The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 component using the component's
addFocusListener
method. When the component gains or loses the keyboard focus,
 the relevant method in the listener object
 is invoked, and the
FocusEvent
is passed to it.
