Interface HierarchyBoundsListener
All Superinterfaces:
EventListener
All Known Implementing Classes:
AWTEventMulticaster
,
HierarchyBoundsAdapter
public interface
HierarchyBoundsListener
extends
EventListener
The listener interface for receiving ancestor moved and resized events.
 The class that is interested in processing these events either implements
 this interface (and all the methods it contains) or extends the abstract
HierarchyBoundsAdapter
class (overriding only the method of
 interest).
 The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 Component using the Component's
addHierarchyBoundsListener
method. When the hierarchy to which the Component belongs changes by
 the resizing or movement of an ancestor, the relevant method in the listener
 object is invoked, and the
HierarchyEvent
is passed to it.
Hierarchy events are provided for notification purposes ONLY;
 The AWT will automatically handle changes to the hierarchy internally so
 that GUI layout works properly regardless of whether a
 program registers an
HierarchyBoundsListener
or not.
