Class HierarchyBoundsAdapter
java.lang.Object
java.awt.event.HierarchyBoundsAdapter
All Implemented Interfaces:
HierarchyBoundsListener
,
EventListener
public abstract class
HierarchyBoundsAdapter
extends
Object
implements
HierarchyBoundsListener
An abstract adapter class for receiving ancestor moved and resized events.
 The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as a
 convenience for creating listener objects.
Extend this class and override the method for the event of interest. (If
 you implement the
HierarchyBoundsListener
interface, you have
 to define both methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for
 them both, so you only have to define the method for the event you care
 about.)
Create a listener object using your class and then register it with a
 Component using the Component's
addHierarchyBoundsListener
method. When the hierarchy to which the Component belongs changes by
 resize or movement of an ancestor, the relevant method in the listener
 object is invoked, and the
HierarchyEvent
is passed to it.
