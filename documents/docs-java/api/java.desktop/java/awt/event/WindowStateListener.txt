public interface
WindowStateListener
extends
EventListener
The listener interface for receiving window state events.
The class that is interested in processing a window state event
 either implements this interface (and all the methods it contains)
 or extends the abstract
WindowAdapter
class
 (overriding only the methods of interest).
The listener object created from that class is then registered with
 a window using the
Window
's
addWindowStateListener
method.  When the window's
 state changes by virtue of being iconified, maximized etc., the
windowStateChanged
method in the listener object is
 invoked, and the
WindowEvent
is passed to it.

1.4
