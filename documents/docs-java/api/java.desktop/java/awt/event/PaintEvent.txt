Class PaintEvent
java.lang.Object
java.util.EventObject
java.awt.AWTEvent
java.awt.event.ComponentEvent
java.awt.event.PaintEvent
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
PaintEvent
extends
ComponentEvent
The component-level paint event.
 This event is a special type which is used to ensure that
 paint/update method calls are serialized along with the other
 events delivered from the event queue.  This event is not
 designed to be used with the Event Listener model; programs
 should continue to override paint/update methods in order
 render themselves properly.
An unspecified behavior will be caused if the
id
parameter
 of any particular
PaintEvent
instance is not
 in the range from
PAINT_FIRST
to
PAINT_LAST
.
Since:
1.1
