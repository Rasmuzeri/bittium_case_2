Class MouseMotionAdapter
java.lang.Object

,
EventListener
Direct Known Subclasses:

public abstract class
MouseMotionAdapter
extends
Object
implements
MouseMotionListener
An abstract adapter class for receiving mouse motion events.
 The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as
 convenience for creating listener objects.
Mouse motion events occur when a mouse is moved or dragged.
 (Many such events will be generated in a normal program.
 To track clicks and other mouse events, use the MouseAdapter.)
Extend this class to create a
MouseEvent
listener
 and override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the
MouseMotionListener
interface, you have to define all of
 the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them
 all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care about.)
Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with
 a component using the component's
addMouseMotionListener
method. When the mouse is moved or dragged, the relevant method in the
 listener object is invoked and the
MouseEvent
is passed to it.
