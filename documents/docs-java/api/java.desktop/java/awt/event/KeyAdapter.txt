public abstract class
KeyAdapter
extends
Object
implements
KeyListener
An abstract adapter class for receiving keyboard events.
 The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as
 convenience for creating listener objects.
Extend this class to create a
KeyEvent
listener
 and override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the
KeyListener
interface, you have to define all of
 the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them
 all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care about.)
Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with
 a component using the component's
addKeyListener
method. When a key is pressed, released, or typed,
 the relevant method in the listener object is invoked,
 and the
KeyEvent
is passed to it.
