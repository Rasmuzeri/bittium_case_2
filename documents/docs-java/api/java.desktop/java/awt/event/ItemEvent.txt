Class ItemEvent
java.lang.Object
java.util.EventObject
java.awt.AWTEvent
java.awt.event.ItemEvent
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
ItemEvent
extends
AWTEvent
A semantic event which indicates that an item was selected or deselected.
 This high-level event is generated by an ItemSelectable object (such as a
 List) when an item is selected or deselected by the user.
 The event is passed to every
ItemListener
object which
 registered to receive such events using the component's
addItemListener
method.
The object that implements the
ItemListener
interface gets
 this
ItemEvent
when the event occurs. The listener is
 spared the details of processing individual mouse movements and mouse
 clicks, and can instead process a "meaningful" (semantic) event like
 "item selected" or "item deselected".
An unspecified behavior will be caused if the
id
parameter
 of any particular
ItemEvent
instance is not
 in the range from
ITEM_FIRST
to
ITEM_LAST
.
The
stateChange
of any
ItemEvent
instance takes one of the following
 values:
ItemEvent.SELECTED
ItemEvent.DESELECTED
Assigning the value different from listed above will cause an unspecified behavior.

1.1
