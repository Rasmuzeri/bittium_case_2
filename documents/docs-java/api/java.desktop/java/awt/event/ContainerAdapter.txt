Class ContainerAdapter
java.lang.Object
java.awt.event.ContainerAdapter
All Implemented Interfaces:
ContainerListener
,
EventListener
public abstract class
ContainerAdapter
extends
Object
implements
ContainerListener
An abstract adapter class for receiving container events.
 The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as
 convenience for creating listener objects.
Extend this class to create a
ContainerEvent
listener
 and override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the
ContainerListener
interface, you have to define all of
 the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them
 all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care about.)
Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with
 a component using the component's
addContainerListener
method. When the container's contents change because a component has
 been added or removed, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked,
 and the
ContainerEvent
is passed to it.
