Package java.awt.event
package
java.awt.event
Provides interfaces and classes for dealing with different types of events
 fired by AWT components. See the
java.awt.AWTEvent
class for details on the AWT event model. Events are fired by event sources.
 An event listener registers with an event source to receive notifications
 about the events of a particular type. This package defines events and event
 listeners, as well as event listener adapters, which are convenience classes
 to make easier the process of writing event listeners.
