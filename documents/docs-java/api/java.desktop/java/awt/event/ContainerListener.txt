public interface
ContainerListener
extends
EventListener
The listener interface for receiving container events.
 The class that is interested in processing a container event
 either implements this interface (and all the methods it
 contains) or extends the abstract
ContainerAdapter
class
 (overriding only the methods of interest).
 The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 component using the component's
addContainerListener
method. When the container's contents change because a component
 has been added or removed, the relevant method in the listener object
 is invoked, and the
ContainerEvent
is passed to it.
Container events are provided for notification purposes ONLY;
 The AWT will automatically handle add and remove operations
 internally so the program works properly regardless of
 whether the program registers a
ContainerListener
or not.
