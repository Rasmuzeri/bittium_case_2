Class ContainerEvent
java.lang.Object
java.util.EventObject
java.awt.AWTEvent
java.awt.event.ComponentEvent
java.awt.event.ContainerEvent
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
ContainerEvent
extends
ComponentEvent
A low-level event which indicates that a container's contents
 changed because a component was added or removed.
Container events are provided for notification purposes ONLY;
 The AWT will automatically handle changes to the containers
 contents internally so that the program works properly regardless of
 whether the program is receiving these events or not.
This low-level event is generated by a container object (such as a
 Panel) when a component is added to it or removed from it.
 The event is passed to every
ContainerListener
or
ContainerAdapter
object which registered to receive such
 events using the component's
addContainerListener
method.
 (
ContainerAdapter
objects implement the
ContainerListener
interface.) Each such listener object
 gets this
ContainerEvent
when the event occurs.
An unspecified behavior will be caused if the
id
parameter
 of any particular
ContainerEvent
instance is not
 in the range from
CONTAINER_FIRST
to
CONTAINER_LAST
.
Since:
1.1
