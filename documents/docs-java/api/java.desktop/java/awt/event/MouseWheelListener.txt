public interface
MouseWheelListener
extends
EventListener
The listener interface for receiving mouse wheel events on a component.
 (For clicks and other mouse events, use the
MouseListener
.
 For mouse movement and drags, use the
MouseMotionListener
.)
The class that is interested in processing a mouse wheel event
 implements this interface (and all the methods it contains).
The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 component using the component's
addMouseWheelListener
method. A mouse wheel event is generated when the mouse wheel is rotated.
 When a mouse wheel event occurs, that object's
mouseWheelMoved
method is invoked.
For information on how mouse wheel events are dispatched, see
 the class description for
MouseWheelEvent
.

1.4
