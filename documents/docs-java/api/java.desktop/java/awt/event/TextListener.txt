public interface
TextListener
extends
EventListener
The listener interface for receiving text events.

 The class that is interested in processing a text event
 implements this interface. The object created with that
 class is then registered with a component using the
 component's
addTextListener
method. When the
 component's text changes, the listener object's
textValueChanged
method is invoked.
