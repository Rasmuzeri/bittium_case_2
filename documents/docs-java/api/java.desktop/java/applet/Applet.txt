Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
The Applet API is deprecated, no replacement.
An applet is a small program that is intended not to be run on its own, but
 rather to be embedded inside another application.
The
Applet
class must be the superclass of any applet that is to be
 embedded in a Web page or viewed by the Java Applet Viewer. The
Applet
class provides a standard interface between applets and their
 environment.

Constructor Details
Applet
public
Applet
()
       throws
HeadlessException
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Constructs a new Applet.
Note: Many methods in
java.applet.Applet
may be invoked by the
 applet only after the applet is fully constructed; applet should avoid
 calling methods in
java.applet.Applet
in the constructor.
Throws:
HeadlessException
- if
GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
returns
true
Since:
1.4
See Also:
GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()
Method Details
setStub
public final
void
setStub
(
AppletStub
stub)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Sets this applet's stub. This is done automatically by the system.
If there is a security manager, its
checkPermission
method is
 called with the
AWTPermission("setAppletStub")
permission if a
 stub has already been set.
Parameters:
stub
- the new stub
Throws:
SecurityException
- if the caller cannot set the stub
isActive
public
boolean
isActive
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Determines if this applet is active. An applet is marked active just
 before its
start
method is called. It becomes inactive just
 before its
stop
method is called.
Returns:
true
if the applet is active;
false
otherwise

then a call to
getParameter("Color")
returns the value
"blue"
.

See Also:
AudioClip
getAppletInfo
public
String
getAppletInfo
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Returns information about this applet. An applet should override this
 method to return a
String
containing information about the
 author, version, and copyright of the applet.
The implementation of this method provided by the
Applet
class
 returns
null
.
Returns:

         copyright of the applet
getLocale
public
Locale
getLocale
()

 locale separated from the locale of the browser or appletviewer.
Overrides:
getLocale
in class
Component

the locale of the applet; if no locale has been set, the default
         locale is returned
Since:
1.1
See Also:
Component.setLocale(java.util.Locale)
getParameterInfo
public
String
[][]
getParameterInfo
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Returns information about the parameters that are understood by this
 applet. An applet should override this method to return an array of
 strings describing these parameters.
Each element of the array should be a set of three strings containing the
 name, the type, and a description. For example:
String pinfo[][] = {
   {"fps",    "1-10",    "frames per second"},
   {"repeat", "boolean", "repeat image loop"},
   {"imgs",   "url",     "images directory"}

play
public
void
play
(

URL
. Nothing
 happens if the audio clip cannot be found.

url
- an absolute
URL
giving the location of the audio clip
play
public
void
play
(
URL
url,
String
name)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Plays the audio clip given the
URL
and a specifier that is
 relative to it. Nothing happens if the audio clip cannot be found.
Parameters:
url
- an absolute
URL
giving the base location of the audio
         clip
name
- the location of the audio clip, relative to the
url
argument
init
public
void
init
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it has
 been loaded into the system. It is always called before the first time
 that the
start
method is called.
A subclass of
Applet
should override this method if it has
 initialization to perform. For example, an applet with threads would use
 the
init
method to create the threads and the
destroy
method to kill them.
The implementation of this method provided by the
Applet
class
 does nothing.
See Also:
destroy()
start()
stop()
start
public
void
start
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it
 should start its execution. It is called after the
init
method
 and each time the applet is revisited in a Web page.
A subclass of
Applet
should override this method if it has any
 operation that it wants to perform each time the Web page containing it
 is visited. For example, an applet with animation might want to use the
start
method to resume animation, and the
stop
method to
 suspend the animation.
Note: some methods, such as
getLocationOnScreen
, can only provide
 meaningful results if the applet is showing. Because
isShowing
returns
false
when the applet's
start
is first called,
 methods requiring
isShowing
to return
true
should be
 called from a
ComponentListener
.
The implementation of this method provided by the
Applet
class
 does nothing.

Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it
 should stop its execution. It is called when the Web page that contains
 this applet has been replaced by another page, and also just before the
 applet is to be destroyed.
A subclass of
Applet
should override this method if it has any
 operation that it wants to perform each time the Web page containing it
 is no longer visible. For example, an applet with animation might want to
 use the
start
method to resume animation, and the
stop
method to suspend the animation.
The implementation of this method provided by the
Applet
class
 does nothing.

Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it is
 being reclaimed and that it should destroy any resources that it has
 allocated. The
stop
method will always be called before
destroy
.
A subclass of
Applet
should override this method if it has any
 operation that it wants to perform before it is destroyed. For example,
 an applet with threads would use the
init
method to create the
 threads and the
destroy
method to kill them.
The implementation of this method provided by the
Applet
class
 does nothing.

()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Gets the
AccessibleContext
associated with this
Applet
.
 For applets, the
AccessibleContext
takes the form of an
AccessibleApplet
. A new
AccessibleApplet
instance is
 created if necessary.
Specified by:
getAccessibleContext
in interface
Accessible
Overrides:
getAccessibleContext
in class
Panel
Returns:
an
AccessibleApplet
that serves as the
AccessibleContext
of this
Applet
