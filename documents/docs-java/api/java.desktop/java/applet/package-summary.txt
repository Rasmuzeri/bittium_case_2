Package java.applet
package
java.applet
Provides the classes necessary to create an applet and the classes an applet
 uses to communicate with its applet context.
The applet framework involves two entities: the
applet
and the
applet context
. An applet is an embeddable window (see the Panel
 class) with a few extra methods that the applet context can use to
 initialize, start, and stop the applet.
The applet context is an application that is responsible for loading and
 running applets. For example, the applet context could be a Web browser or an
 applet development environment.
