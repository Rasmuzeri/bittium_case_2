AppletContext
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
The Applet API is deprecated, no replacement.
This interface corresponds to an applet's environment: the document
 containing the applet and the other applets in the same document.
The methods in this interface can be used by an applet to obtain information
 about its environment.
Since:
1.0

Method Details
getAudioClip
AudioClip
getAudioClip
(
URL
url)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Creates an audio clip.
Parameters:
url
- an absolute
URL
giving the location of the audio clip
Returns:
the audio clip at the specified
URL
getImage
Image
getImage
(
URL
url)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Returns an
Image
object that can then be painted on the screen.
 The
url
argument that is passed as an argument must specify an
 absolute
URL
.
This method always returns immediately, whether or not the image exists.
 When the applet attempts to draw the image on the screen, the data will
 be loaded. The graphics primitives that draw the image will incrementally
 paint on the screen.
Parameters:
url
- an absolute
URL
giving the location of the image
Returns:
the image at the specified
URL

getApplet
(
String
name)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Finds and returns the applet in the document represented by this applet
 context with the given name. The name can be set in the HTML tag by
 setting the
name
attribute.
Parameters:
name
- an applet name
Returns:
the applet with the given name, or
null
if not found

>
getApplets
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Finds all the applets in the document represented by this applet context.
Returns:
an enumeration of all applets in the document represented by this
         applet context
showDocument
void
showDocument
(
URL
url)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Requests that the browser or applet viewer show the Web page indicated by
 the
url
argument. The browser or applet viewer determines which
 window or frame to display the Web page. This method may be ignored by
 applet contexts that are not browsers.
Parameters:
url
- an absolute
URL
giving the location of the document
showDocument
void
showDocument
(
URL
url,
String
target)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Requests that the browser or applet viewer show the Web page indicated by
 the
url
argument. The
target
argument indicates in which
 HTML frame the document is to be displayed. The target argument is
 interpreted as follows:
Target arguments and their descriptions
Target Argument
Description
"_self"
Show in the window and frame that contain the applet.
"_parent"
Show in the applet's parent frame. If the applet's frame has no
     parent frame, acts the same as "_self".
"_top"
Show in the top-level frame of the applet's window. If the
     applet's frame is the top-level frame, acts the same as "_self".
"_blank"
Show in a new, unnamed top-level window.
name
Show in the frame or window named
name
. If a target named
name
does not already exist, a new top-level window with the
     specified name is created, and the document is shown there.
An applet viewer or browser is free to ignore
showDocument
.
Parameters:
url
- an absolute
URL
giving the location of the document
target
- a
String
indicating where to display the page
showStatus
void
showStatus
(
String
status)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Requests that the argument string be displayed in the "status window".
 Many browsers and applet viewers provide such a window, where the
 application can inform users of its current state.
Parameters:
status
- a string to display in the status window
setStream
void
setStream
(
String
key,
InputStream
stream)
throws
IOException
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Associates the specified stream with the specified key in this applet
 context. If the applet context previously contained a mapping for this
 key, the old value is replaced.
For security reasons, mapping of streams and keys exists for each
 codebase. In other words, applet from one codebase cannot access the
 streams created by an applet from a different codebase
Parameters:
key
- key with which the specified value is to be associated
stream
- stream to be associated with the specified key. If this
         parameter is
null
, the specified key is removed in this
         applet context.
Throws:
IOException
- if the stream size exceeds a certain size limit. Size
         limit is decided by the implementor of this interface.
Since:
1.4
getStream
InputStream
getStream
(
String
key)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Returns the stream to which specified key is associated within this
 applet context. Returns
null
if the applet context contains no
 stream for this key.
For security reasons, mapping of streams and keys exists for each
 codebase. In other words, applet from one codebase cannot access the
 streams created by an applet from a different codebase.
Parameters:
key
- key whose associated stream is to be returned
Returns:
the stream to which this applet context maps the key
Since:
1.4
getStreamKeys
Iterator
<
String
>
getStreamKeys
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Finds all the keys of the streams in this applet context.
For security reasons, mapping of streams and keys exists for each
 codebase. In other words, applet from one codebase cannot access the
 streams created by an applet from a different codebase.
Returns:
an
Iterator
of all the names of the streams in this
         applet context
Since:
1.4
