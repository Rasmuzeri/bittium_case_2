BeanProperty
An annotation used to specify some property-related information for the
 automatically generated
BeanInfo
classes. This annotation is not used
 if the annotated class has a corresponding user-defined
BeanInfo
class, which does not imply the automatic analysis. If both the read and the
 write methods of the property are annotated, then the read method annotation
 will have more priority and replace the write method annotation.
