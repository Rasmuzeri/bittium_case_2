Class XMLDecoder
java.lang.Object
java.beans.XMLDecoder
All Implemented Interfaces:
AutoCloseable
public class
XMLDecoder
extends
Object
implements
AutoCloseable
The
XMLDecoder
class is used to read XML documents
 created using the
XMLEncoder
and is used just like
 the
ObjectInputStream
. For example, one can use
 the following fragment to read the first object defined
 in an XML document written by the
XMLEncoder
class:
XMLDecoder d = new XMLDecoder(
                          new BufferedInputStream(
                              new FileInputStream("Test.xml")));
       Object result = d.readObject();
       d.close();

Constructor Details
XMLDecoder
public
XMLDecoder
(
InputStream
in)
Creates a new input stream for reading archives
 created by the
XMLEncoder
class.
Parameters:
in
- The underlying stream.
See Also:
XMLEncoder(java.io.OutputStream)
XMLDecoder
public
XMLDecoder
(
InputStream
in,
Object
owner)
Creates a new input stream for reading archives
 created by the
XMLEncoder
class.
Parameters:
in
- The underlying stream.
owner
- The owner of this stream.
XMLDecoder
public
XMLDecoder
(
InputStream
in,
Object
owner,
ExceptionListener
exceptionListener)
Creates a new input stream for reading archives
 created by the
XMLEncoder
class.
Parameters:
in
- the underlying stream.
owner
- the owner of this stream.
exceptionListener
- the exception handler for the stream;
        if
null
the default exception listener will be used.
XMLDecoder
public
XMLDecoder
(
InputStream
in,
Object
owner,
ExceptionListener
exceptionListener,
ClassLoader
cl)
Creates a new input stream for reading archives
 created by the
XMLEncoder
class.
Parameters:
in
- the underlying stream.
null
may be passed without
        error, though the resulting XMLDecoder will be useless
owner
- the owner of this stream.
null
is a legal
        value
exceptionListener
- the exception handler for the stream, or
null
to use the default
cl
- the class loader used for instantiating objects.
null
indicates that the default class loader should
        be used
Since:
1.5
XMLDecoder
public
XMLDecoder
(
InputSource
is)
Creates a new decoder to parse XML archives
 created by the
XMLEncoder
class.
 If the input source
is
is
null
,
 no exception is thrown and no parsing is performed.
 This behavior is similar to behavior of other constructors
 that use
InputStream
as a parameter.
Parameters:
is
- the input source to parse
Since:
1.7
Method Details
close
public
void
close
()
This method closes the input stream associated
 with this stream.
Specified by:
close
in interface
AutoCloseable
setExceptionListener
public
void
setExceptionListener
(
ExceptionListener
exceptionListener)
Sets the exception handler for this stream to
exceptionListener
.
 The exception handler is notified when this stream catches recoverable
 exceptions.
Parameters:
exceptionListener
- The exception handler for this stream;
 if
null
the default exception listener will be used.
See Also:
getExceptionListener()
getExceptionListener
public
ExceptionListener
getExceptionListener
()
Gets the exception handler for this stream.
Returns:
The exception handler for this stream.
     Will return the default exception listener if this has not explicitly been set.
See Also:
setExceptionListener(java.beans.ExceptionListener)
readObject
public
Object
readObject
()
Reads the next object from the underlying input stream.
Returns:
the next object read
Throws:
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
- if the stream contains no objects
         (or no more objects)
See Also:
XMLEncoder.writeObject(java.lang.Object)
setOwner
public
void
setOwner
(
Object
owner)
Sets the owner of this decoder to
owner
.
Parameters:
owner
- The owner of this decoder.
See Also:
getOwner()
getOwner
public
Object
getOwner
()
Gets the owner of this decoder.
Returns:
The owner of this decoder.
See Also:
setOwner(java.lang.Object)
createHandler
public static
DefaultHandler
createHandler
(
Object
owner,
ExceptionListener
el,
ClassLoader
cl)
Creates a new handler for SAX parser
 that can be used to parse embedded XML archives
 created by the
XMLEncoder
class.

 The
owner
should be used if parsed XML document contains
 the method call within context of the <java> element.
 The
null
value may cause illegal parsing in such case.
 The same problem may occur, if the
owner
class
 does not contain expected method to call. See details
here
.
Parameters:
owner
- the owner of the default handler
               that can be used as a value of <java> element
el
- the exception handler for the parser,
               or
null
to use the default exception handler
cl
- the class loader used for instantiating objects,
               or
null
to use the default class loader
Returns:
an instance of
DefaultHandler
for SAX parser
