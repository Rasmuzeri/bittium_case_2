AppletInitializer
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
The Applet API is deprecated. See the
java.applet package
 documentation
for further information.
This interface is designed to work in collusion with java.beans.Beans.instantiate.
 The interface is intended to provide mechanism to allow the proper
 initialization of JavaBeans that are also Applets, during their
 instantiation by java.beans.Beans.instantiate().
Since:
1.2

bCtxt)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
If passed to the appropriate variant of java.beans.Beans.instantiate
 this method will be called in order to associate the newly instantiated
 Applet (JavaBean) with its AppletContext, AppletStub, and Container.
Conformant implementations shall:
Associate the newly instantiated Applet with the appropriate
 AppletContext.
Instantiate an AppletStub() and associate that AppletStub with
 the Applet via an invocation of setStub().
If BeanContext parameter is null, then it shall associate the
 Applet with its appropriate Container by adding that Applet to its
 Container via an invocation of add(). If the BeanContext parameter is
 non-null, then it is the responsibility of the BeanContext to associate
 the Applet with its Container during the subsequent invocation of its
 addChildren() method.
Parameters:
newAppletBean
- The newly instantiated JavaBean
bCtxt
- The BeanContext intended for this Applet, or
                       null.

 method.
Parameters:

- The newly instantiated JavaBean
