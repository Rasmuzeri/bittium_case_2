Class IndexedPropertyChangeEvent
java.lang.Object
java.util.EventObject
java.beans.PropertyChangeEvent
java.beans.IndexedPropertyChangeEvent
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
IndexedPropertyChangeEvent
extends
PropertyChangeEvent
An "IndexedPropertyChange" event gets delivered whenever a component that
 conforms to the JavaBeans specification (a "bean") changes a bound
 indexed property. This class is an extension of
PropertyChangeEvent
but contains the index of the property that has changed.
Null values may be provided for the old and the new values if their
 true values are not known.
An event source may send a null object as the name to indicate that an
 arbitrary set of if its properties have changed.  In this case the
 old and new values should also be null.
Since:
1.5
