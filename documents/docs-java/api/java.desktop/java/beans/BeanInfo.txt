Interface BeanInfo
All Known Subinterfaces:
BeanContextServiceProviderBeanInfo
All Known Implementing Classes:
SimpleBeanInfo
public interface
BeanInfo
Use the
BeanInfo
interface
 to create a
BeanInfo
class
 and provide explicit information about the methods,
 properties, events, and other features of your beans.
When developing your bean, you can implement
 the bean features required for your application task
 omitting the rest of the
BeanInfo
features.
 They will be obtained through the automatic analysis
 by using the low-level reflection of the bean methods
 and applying standard design patterns.
 You have an opportunity to provide additional bean information
 through various descriptor classes.
See the
SimpleBeanInfo
class that is
 a convenient basic class for
BeanInfo
classes.
 You can override the methods and properties of
 the
SimpleBeanInfo
class to define specific information.
See also the
Introspector
class to learn more about bean behavior.

Method Details
getBeanDescriptor
BeanDescriptor
getBeanDescriptor
()
Returns the bean descriptor
 that provides overall information about the bean,
 such as its display name or its customizer.
Returns:
a
BeanDescriptor
object,
          or
null
if the information is to
          be obtained through the automatic analysis
getEventSetDescriptors
EventSetDescriptor
[]
getEventSetDescriptors
()
Returns the event descriptors of the bean
 that define the types of events fired by this bean.
Returns:
an array of
EventSetDescriptor
objects,
          or
null
if the information is to
          be obtained through the automatic analysis
getDefaultEventIndex
int
getDefaultEventIndex
()
A bean may have a default event typically applied when this bean is used.
Returns:
index of the default event in the
EventSetDescriptor
array
          returned by the
getEventSetDescriptors
method,
          or -1 if there is no default event
getPropertyDescriptors
PropertyDescriptor
[]
getPropertyDescriptors
()
Returns descriptors for all properties of the bean.
If a property is indexed, then its entry in the result array
 belongs to the
IndexedPropertyDescriptor
subclass
 of the
PropertyDescriptor
class.
 A client of the
getPropertyDescriptors
method
 can use the
instanceof
operator to check
 whether a given
PropertyDescriptor
is an
IndexedPropertyDescriptor
.
Returns:
an array of
PropertyDescriptor
objects,
          or
null
if the information is to
          be obtained through the automatic analysis
getDefaultPropertyIndex
int
getDefaultPropertyIndex
()
A bean may have a default property commonly updated when this bean is customized.
Returns:
index of the default property in the
PropertyDescriptor
array
          returned by the
getPropertyDescriptors
method,
          or -1 if there is no default property
getMethodDescriptors
MethodDescriptor
[]
getMethodDescriptors
()
Returns the method descriptors of the bean
 that define the externally visible methods supported by this bean.
Returns:
an array of
MethodDescriptor
objects,
          or
null
if the information is to
          be obtained through the automatic analysis
getAdditionalBeanInfo
BeanInfo
[]
getAdditionalBeanInfo
()
This method enables the current
BeanInfo
object
 to return an arbitrary collection of other
BeanInfo
objects
 that provide additional information about the current bean.
If there are conflicts or overlaps between the information
 provided by different
BeanInfo
objects,
 the current
BeanInfo
object takes priority
 over the additional
BeanInfo
objects.
 Array elements with higher indices take priority
 over the elements with lower indices.
Returns:
an array of
BeanInfo
objects,
          or
null
if there are no additional
BeanInfo
objects
getIcon
Image
getIcon
(int iconKind)
Returns an image that can be used to represent the bean in toolboxes or toolbars.
There are four possible types of icons:
 16 x 16 color, 32 x 32 color, 16 x 16 mono, and 32 x 32 mono.
 If you implement a bean so that it supports a single icon,
 it is recommended to use 16 x 16 color.
 Another recommendation is to set a transparent background for the icons.
Parameters:
iconKind
- the kind of icon requested
Returns:
an image object representing the requested icon,
                   or
null
if no suitable icon is available
