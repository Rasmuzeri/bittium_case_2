Visibility
Under some circumstances a bean may be run on servers where a GUI
 is not available.  This interface can be used to query a bean to
 determine whether it absolutely needs a gui, and to advise the
 bean whether a GUI is available.
This interface is for expert developers, and is not needed
 for normal simple beans.  To avoid confusing end-users we
 avoid using getXXX setXXX design patterns for these methods.
