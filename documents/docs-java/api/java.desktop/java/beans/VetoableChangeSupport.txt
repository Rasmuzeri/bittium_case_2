Class VetoableChangeSupport
java.lang.Object
java.beans.VetoableChangeSupport
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
VetoableChangeSupport
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
This is a utility class that can be used by beans that support constrained
 properties.  It manages a list of listeners and dispatches
PropertyChangeEvent
s to them.  You can use an instance of this class
 as a member field of your bean and delegate these types of work to it.
 The
VetoableChangeListener
can be registered for all properties
 or for a property specified by name.
Here is an example of
VetoableChangeSupport
usage that follows
 the rules and recommendations laid out in the JavaBeans specification:
public class MyBean {
     private final VetoableChangeSupport vcs = new VetoableChangeSupport(this);

     public void addVetoableChangeListener(VetoableChangeListener listener) {
         this.vcs.addVetoableChangeListener(listener);
     }

     public void removeVetoableChangeListener(VetoableChangeListener listener) {
         this.vcs.removeVetoableChangeListener(listener);
     }

     private String value;

     public String getValue() {
         return this.value;
     }

     public void setValue(String newValue) throws PropertyVetoException {
         String oldValue = this.value;
         this.vcs.fireVetoableChange("value", oldValue, newValue);
         this.value = newValue;
     }

     [...]
 }
A
VetoableChangeSupport
instance is thread-safe.
This class is serializable.  When it is serialized it will save
 (and restore) any listeners that are themselves serializable.  Any
 non-serializable listeners will be skipped during serialization.
Since:
1.1

Constructor Details
VetoableChangeSupport
public
VetoableChangeSupport
(
Object
sourceBean)
Constructs a
VetoableChangeSupport
object.
Parameters:
sourceBean
- The bean to be given as the source for any events.
Method Details
addVetoableChangeListener
public
void
addVetoableChangeListener
(
VetoableChangeListener
listener)
Add a VetoableChangeListener to the listener list.
 The listener is registered for all properties.
 The same listener object may be added more than once, and will be called
 as many times as it is added.
 If
listener
is null, no exception is thrown and no action
 is taken.
Parameters:
listener
- The VetoableChangeListener to be added
removeVetoableChangeListener
public
void
removeVetoableChangeListener
(
VetoableChangeListener
listener)
Remove a VetoableChangeListener from the listener list.
 This removes a VetoableChangeListener that was registered
 for all properties.
 If
listener
was added more than once to the same event
 source, it will be notified one less time after being removed.
 If
listener
is null, or was never added, no exception is
 thrown and no action is taken.
Parameters:
listener
- The VetoableChangeListener to be removed
getVetoableChangeListeners
public
VetoableChangeListener
[]
getVetoableChangeListeners
()
Returns an array of all the listeners that were added to the
 VetoableChangeSupport object with addVetoableChangeListener().
If some listeners have been added with a named property, then
 the returned array will be a mixture of VetoableChangeListeners
 and
VetoableChangeListenerProxy
s. If the calling
 method is interested in distinguishing the listeners then it must
 test each element to see if it's a
VetoableChangeListenerProxy
, perform the cast, and examine
 the parameter.
VetoableChangeListener[] listeners = bean.getVetoableChangeListeners();
 for (int i = 0; i < listeners.length; i++) {
        if (listeners[i] instanceof VetoableChangeListenerProxy) {
     VetoableChangeListenerProxy proxy =
                    (VetoableChangeListenerProxy)listeners[i];
     if (proxy.getPropertyName().equals("foo")) {
       // proxy is a VetoableChangeListener which was associated
       // with the property named "foo"
     }
   }
 }
Returns:
all of the
VetoableChangeListeners
added or an
         empty array if no listeners have been added

1.4

addVetoableChangeListener
public
void
addVetoableChangeListener
(
String
propertyName,
VetoableChangeListener
listener)
Add a VetoableChangeListener for a specific property.  The listener
 will be invoked only when a call on fireVetoableChange names that
 specific property.
 The same listener object may be added more than once.  For each
 property,  the listener will be invoked the number of times it was added
 for that property.
 If
propertyName
or
listener
is null, no
 exception is thrown and no action is taken.
Parameters:
propertyName
- The name of the property to listen on.
listener
- The VetoableChangeListener to be added
Since:
1.2
removeVetoableChangeListener
public
void
removeVetoableChangeListener
(
String
propertyName,
VetoableChangeListener
listener)
Remove a VetoableChangeListener for a specific property.
 If
listener
was added more than once to the same event
 source for the specified property, it will be notified one less time
 after being removed.
 If
propertyName
is null, no exception is thrown and no
 action is taken.
 If
listener
is null, or was never added for the specified
 property, no exception is thrown and no action is taken.
Parameters:
propertyName
- The name of the property that was listened on.
listener
- The VetoableChangeListener to be removed
Since:
1.2
getVetoableChangeListeners
public
VetoableChangeListener
[]
getVetoableChangeListeners
(
String
propertyName)
Returns an array of all the listeners which have been associated
 with the named property.
Parameters:
propertyName
- The name of the property being listened to
Returns:
all the
VetoableChangeListeners
associated with
         the named property.  If no such listeners have been added,
         or if
propertyName
is null, an empty array is
         returned.

fireVetoableChange
public
void
fireVetoableChange
(

propertyName,
Object
oldValue,
Object
newValue)
throws
PropertyVetoException
Reports a constrained property update to listeners
 that have been registered to track updates of
 all properties or a property with the specified name.
Any listener can throw a
PropertyVetoException
to veto the update.
 If one of the listeners vetoes the update, this method passes
 a new "undo"
PropertyChangeEvent
that reverts to the old value
 to all listeners that already confirmed this update
 and throws the
PropertyVetoException
again.
No event is fired if old and new values are equal and non-null.
This is merely a convenience wrapper around the more general
fireVetoableChange(PropertyChangeEvent)
method.
Parameters:
propertyName
- the programmatic name of the property that is about to change
oldValue
- the old value of the property
newValue
- the new value of the property
Throws:
PropertyVetoException
- if one of listeners vetoes the property update
