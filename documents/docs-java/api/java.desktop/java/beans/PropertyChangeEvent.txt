Class PropertyChangeEvent
java.lang.Object
java.util.EventObject
java.beans.PropertyChangeEvent
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
Direct Known Subclasses:
IndexedPropertyChangeEvent
public class
PropertyChangeEvent
extends
EventObject
A "PropertyChange" event gets delivered whenever a bean changes a "bound"
 or "constrained" property.  A PropertyChangeEvent object is sent as an
 argument to the PropertyChangeListener and VetoableChangeListener methods.
Normally PropertyChangeEvents are accompanied by the name and the old
 and new value of the changed property.  If the new value is a primitive
 type (such as int or boolean) it must be wrapped as the
 corresponding java.lang.* Object type (such as Integer or Boolean).
Null values may be provided for the old and the new values if their
 true values are not known.
An event source may send a null object as the name to indicate that an
 arbitrary set of if its properties have changed.  In this case the
 old and new values should also be null.

Constructs a new

Parameters:

- the bean that fired the event
propertyName
- the programmatic name of the property that was changed
oldValue
- the old value of the property
newValue
- the new value of the property
Throws:

Method Details
getPropertyName
public
String
getPropertyName
()
Gets the programmatic name of the property that was changed.
Returns:
The programmatic name of the property that was changed.
          May be null if multiple properties have changed.
getNewValue
public
Object
getNewValue
()
Gets the new value for the property, expressed as an Object.
Returns:
The new value for the property, expressed as an Object.
          May be null if multiple properties have changed.
getOldValue
public
Object
getOldValue
()
Gets the old value for the property, expressed as an Object.
Returns:
The old value for the property, expressed as an Object.
          May be null if multiple properties have changed.
setPropagationId
public
void
setPropagationId
(
Object
propagationId)
Sets the propagationId object for the event.
Parameters:
propagationId
- The propagationId object for the event.
getPropagationId
public
Object
getPropagationId
()
The "propagationId" field is reserved for future use.  In Beans 1.0
 the sole requirement is that if a listener catches a PropertyChangeEvent
 and then fires a PropertyChangeEvent of its own, then it should
 make sure that it propagates the propagationId field from its
 incoming event to its outgoing event.
Returns:
the propagationId object associated with a bound/constrained
          property update.
toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns a string representation of the object.
Overrides:
toString
in class
EventObject
Returns:
a string representation of the object
