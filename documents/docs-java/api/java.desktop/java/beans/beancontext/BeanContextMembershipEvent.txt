java.beans.beancontext.BeanContextEvent
java.beans.beancontext.BeanContextMembershipEvent
All Implemented Interfaces:

public class
BeanContextMembershipEvent
extends
BeanContextEvent
A
BeanContextMembershipEvent
encapsulates
 the list of children added to, or removed from,
 the membership of a particular
BeanContext
.
 An instance of this event is fired whenever a successful
 add(), remove(), retainAll(), removeAll(), or clear() is
 invoked on a given
BeanContext
instance.
 Objects interested in receiving events of this type must
 implement the
BeanContextMembershipListener
interface, and must register their intent via the
BeanContext
's
addBeanContextMembershipListener(BeanContextMembershipListener bcml)
method.
