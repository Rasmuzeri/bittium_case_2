public interface
BeanContextChild
JavaBeans wishing to be nested within, and obtain a reference to their
 execution environment, or context, as defined by the BeanContext
 sub-interface shall implement this interface.
Conformant BeanContexts shall as a side effect of adding a BeanContextChild
 object shall pass a reference to itself via the setBeanContext() method of
 this interface.
Note that a BeanContextChild may refuse a change in state by throwing
 PropertyVetoedException in response.
In order for persistence mechanisms to function properly on BeanContextChild
 instances across a broad variety of scenarios, implementing classes of this
 interface are required to define as transient, any or all fields, or
 instance variables, that may contain, or represent, references to the
 nesting BeanContext instance or other resources obtained
 from the BeanContext via any unspecified mechanisms.

in order to receive a
PropertyChangeEvent
whenever the specified property has changed.
void
addVetoableChangeListener
(
String
name,
VetoableChangeListener
vcl)
Adds a
VetoableChangeListener
to
 this
BeanContextChild
to receive events whenever the specified property changes.
BeanContext
getBeanContext
()
Gets the
BeanContext
associated
 with this
BeanContextChild
.
void
removePropertyChangeListener
(
String
name,
PropertyChangeListener
pcl)
Removes a
PropertyChangeListener
from this
BeanContextChild
so that it no longer
 receives

 specified property is changed.
void
removeVetoableChangeListener
(
String
name,
VetoableChangeListener
vcl)

 events when the specified property changes.
void
setBeanContext
(
BeanContext
bc)
Objects that implement this interface,
 shall fire a java.beans.PropertyChangeEvent, with parameters:

 propertyName "beanContext", oldValue (the previous nesting
BeanContext
instance, or
null
),
 newValue (the current nesting
BeanContext
instance, or
null
).
Method Details
setBeanContext
void
setBeanContext
(
BeanContext
bc)
throws
PropertyVetoException
Objects that implement this interface,
 shall fire a java.beans.PropertyChangeEvent, with parameters:

 propertyName "beanContext", oldValue (the previous nesting
BeanContext
instance, or
null
),
 newValue (the current nesting
BeanContext
instance, or
null
).
A change in the value of the nesting BeanContext property of this
 BeanContextChild may be vetoed by throwing the appropriate exception.
Parameters:
bc
- The
BeanContext
with which
 to associate this
BeanContextChild
.
Throws:
PropertyVetoException
- if the
 addition of the specified
BeanContext
is refused.
getBeanContext
BeanContext
getBeanContext
()
Gets the
BeanContext
associated
 with this
BeanContextChild
.
Returns:
the
BeanContext
associated
 with this
BeanContextChild
.
