 source for the specified property, it will be notified one less time
 after being removed.
 If

is null, no exception is thrown
 and no action is taken.
 If
pcl
is null, or was never added for the specified
 property, no exception is thrown and no action is taken.
Specified by:

Add a VetoableChangeListener for a specific property.
 The same listener object may be added more than once.  For each
 property,  the listener will be invoked the number of times it was added
 for that property.
 If
name
or

isDelegated
public
boolean
isDelegated
()
Reports whether or not this class is a delegate of another.

firePropertyChange
public
void
firePropertyChange
(
String
name,
Object
oldValue,
Object
newValue)
Report a bound property update to any registered listeners. No event is
 fired if old and new are equal and non-null.
Parameters:
name
- The programmatic name of the property that was changed
oldValue
- The old value of the property
newValue
- The new value of the property
fireVetoableChange
public
void
fireVetoableChange
(
String
name,
Object
oldValue,
Object
newValue)
throws
PropertyVetoException
Report a vetoable property update to any registered listeners.
 If anyone vetos the change, then fire a new event
 reverting everyone to the old value and then rethrow
 the PropertyVetoException.
No event is fired if old and new are equal and non-null.
Parameters:
name
- The programmatic name of the property that is about to
 change
oldValue
- The old value of the property
newValue
- - The new value of the property
Throws:
PropertyVetoException
- if the recipient wishes the property
 change to be rolled back.
validatePendingSetBeanContext
public
boolean
validatePendingSetBeanContext
(
BeanContext
newValue)
Called from setBeanContext to validate (or otherwise) the
 pending change in the nesting BeanContext property value.
 Returning false will cause setBeanContext to throw
 PropertyVetoException.
Parameters:
newValue
- the new value that has been requested for
  the BeanContext property
Returns:
true
if the change operation is to be vetoed
releaseBeanContextResources
protected
void
releaseBeanContextResources
()
This method may be overridden by subclasses to provide their own
 release behaviors. When invoked any resources held by this instance
 obtained from its current BeanContext property should be released
 since the object is no longer nested within that BeanContext.
initializeBeanContextResources
protected
void
initializeBeanContextResources
()
This method may be overridden by subclasses to provide their own
 initialization behaviors. When invoked any resources required by the
 BeanContextChild should be obtained from the current BeanContext.
