Interface BeanContextProxy
public interface
BeanContextProxy
This interface is implemented by a JavaBean that does
 not directly have a BeanContext(Child) associated with
 it (via implementing that interface or a subinterface thereof),
 but has a public BeanContext(Child) delegated from it.
 For example, a subclass of java.awt.Container may have a BeanContext
 associated with it that all Component children of that Container shall
 be contained within.
An Object may not implement this interface and the
 BeanContextChild interface
 (or any subinterfaces thereof) they are mutually exclusive.
Callers of this interface shall examine the return type in order to
 obtain a particular subinterface of BeanContextChild as follows:
BeanContextChild bcc = o.getBeanContextProxy();

 if (bcc instanceof BeanContext) {
      // ...
 }
or
BeanContextChild bcc = o.getBeanContextProxy();
 BeanContext      bc  = null;

 try {
     bc = (BeanContext)bcc;
 } catch (ClassCastException cce) {
     // cast failed, bcc is not an instanceof BeanContext
 }
The return value is a constant for the lifetime of the implementing
 instance
Since:
1.2
