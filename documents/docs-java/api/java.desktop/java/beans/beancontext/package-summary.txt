Package java.beans.beancontext
package
java.beans.beancontext
Provides classes and interfaces relating to bean context. A bean context is a
 container for beans and defines the execution environment for the beans it
 contains. There can be several beans in a single bean context, and a bean
 context can be nested within another bean context. This package also
 contains events and listener interface for beans being added and removed from
 a bean context.

Description
BeanContext
The BeanContext acts a logical hierarchical container for JavaBeans.
BeanContextChild
JavaBeans wishing to be nested within, and obtain a reference to their
 execution environment, or context, as defined by the BeanContext
 sub-interface shall implement this interface.
BeanContextChildComponentProxy
This interface is implemented by
BeanContextChildren
that have an AWT
Component
associated with them.
BeanContextChildSupport
This is a general support class to provide support for implementing the
 BeanContextChild protocol.
BeanContextContainerProxy
This interface is implemented by BeanContexts' that have an AWT Container
 associated with them.
BeanContextEvent
BeanContextEvent
is the abstract root event class
 for all events emitted
 from, and pertaining to the semantics of, a
BeanContext
.
BeanContextMembershipEvent
A
BeanContextMembershipEvent
encapsulates
 the list of children added to, or removed from,
 the membership of a particular
BeanContext
.
BeanContextMembershipListener
Compliant BeanContexts fire events on this interface when the state of
 the membership of the BeanContext changes.
BeanContextProxy
This interface is implemented by a JavaBean that does
 not directly have a BeanContext(Child) associated with
 it (via implementing that interface or a subinterface thereof),
 but has a public BeanContext(Child) delegated from it.
BeanContextServiceAvailableEvent
This event type is used by the BeanContextServicesListener in order to
 identify the service being registered.
BeanContextServiceProvider
One of the primary functions of a BeanContext is to act a as rendezvous
 between JavaBeans, and BeanContextServiceProviders.
BeanContextServiceProviderBeanInfo
A BeanContextServiceProvider implementor who wishes to provide explicit
 information about the services their bean may provide shall implement a
 BeanInfo class that implements this BeanInfo subinterface and provides
 explicit information about the methods, properties, events, etc, of their
 services.
BeanContextServiceRevokedEvent
This event type is used by the
BeanContextServiceRevokedListener
in order to
 identify the service being revoked.
BeanContextServiceRevokedListener
The listener interface for receiving
BeanContextServiceRevokedEvent
objects.
BeanContextServices
The BeanContextServices interface provides a mechanism for a BeanContext
 to expose generic "services" to the BeanContextChild objects within.
BeanContextServicesListener
The listener interface for receiving
BeanContextServiceAvailableEvent
objects.
BeanContextServicesSupport
This helper class provides a utility implementation of the
 java.beans.beancontext.BeanContextServices interface.
BeanContextServicesSupport.BCSSServiceProvider
subclasses may subclass this nested class to add behaviors for
 each BeanContextServicesProvider.
BeanContextSupport
This helper class provides a utility implementation of the
 java.beans.beancontext.BeanContext interface.
BeanContextSupport.BCSIterator
protected final subclass that encapsulates an iterator but implements
 a noop remove() method.
