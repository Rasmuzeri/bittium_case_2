public abstract class
BeanContextEvent
extends
EventObject
BeanContextEvent
is the abstract root event class
 for all events emitted
 from, and pertaining to the semantics of, a
BeanContext
.
 This class introduces a mechanism to allow the propagation of
BeanContextEvent
subclasses through a hierarchy of
BeanContext
s. The
setPropagatedFrom()
and
getPropagatedFrom()
methods allow a
BeanContext
to identify itself as the source
 of a propagated event.
