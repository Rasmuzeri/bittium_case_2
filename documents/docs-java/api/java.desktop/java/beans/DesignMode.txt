Interface DesignMode
All Known Subinterfaces:

All Known Implementing Classes:

public interface
DesignMode
This interface is intended to be implemented by, or delegated from, instances
 of java.beans.beancontext.BeanContext, in order to propagate to its nested hierarchy
 of java.beans.beancontext.BeanContextChild instances, the current "designTime" property.
The JavaBeans specification defines the notion of design time as is a
 mode in which JavaBeans instances should function during their composition
 and customization in a interactive design, composition or construction tool,
 as opposed to runtime when the JavaBean is part of an applet, application,
 or other live Java executable abstraction.

boolean

()
A value of true denotes that JavaBeans should behave in design time
 mode, a value of false denotes runtime behavior.

Method Details
setDesignTime
void
setDesignTime
(boolean designTime)
Sets the "value" of the "designTime" property.
If the implementing object is an instance of java.beans.beancontext.BeanContext,
 or a subinterface thereof, then that BeanContext should fire a
 PropertyChangeEvent, to its registered BeanContextMembershipListeners, with
 parameters:
propertyName
-
java.beans.DesignMode.PROPERTYNAME
oldValue
- previous value of "designTime"
newValue
- current value of "designTime"
Note it is illegal for a BeanContextChild to invoke this method
 associated with a BeanContext that it is nested within.
Parameters:
designTime
- the current "value" of the "designTime" property
See Also:
BeanContext
BeanContextMembershipListener
PropertyChangeEvent
isDesignTime
boolean
isDesignTime
()
A value of true denotes that JavaBeans should behave in design time
 mode, a value of false denotes runtime behavior.
Returns:
the current "value" of the "designTime" property.
