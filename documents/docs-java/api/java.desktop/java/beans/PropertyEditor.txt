PropertyEditor
A PropertyEditor class provides support for GUIs that want to
 allow users to edit a property value of a given type.
PropertyEditor supports a variety of different kinds of ways of
 displaying and updating property values.  Most PropertyEditors will
 only need to support a subset of the different options available in
 this API.
Simple PropertyEditors may only support the getAsText and setAsText
 methods and need not support (say) paintValue or getCustomEditor.  More
 complex types may be unable to support getAsText and setAsText but will
 instead support paintValue and getCustomEditor.
Every propertyEditor must support one or more of the three simple
 display styles.  Thus it can either (1) support isPaintable or (2)
 both return a non-null String[] from getTags() and return a non-null
 value from getAsText or (3) simply return a non-null String from
 getAsText().
Every property editor must support a call on setValue when the argument
 object is of the type for which this is the corresponding propertyEditor.
 In addition, each property editor must either support a custom editor,
 or support setAsText.
Each PropertyEditor should have a null constructor.

Modifier and Type
Method
Description
void
addPropertyChangeListener
(
PropertyChangeListener
listener)
Adds a listener for the value change.
String
getAsText

 that edits its property value.
String
getJavaInitializationString
()
Returns a fragment of Java code that can be used to set a property
 to match the editors current state.
String
[]
getTags

If the property value must be one of a set of known tagged values,
 then this method should return an array of the tags.
Object
getValue
()

boolean
isPaintable
()
Determines whether this property editor is paintable.
void
paintValue

Graphics
gfx,
Rectangle
box)
Paint a representation of the value into a given area of screen
 real estate.
void
removePropertyChangeListener
(
PropertyChangeListener
listener)
Removes a listener for the value change.
void
setAsText
(
String
text)
Set the property value by parsing a given String.
void
setValue
(
Object
value)
Set (or change) the object that is to be edited.
boolean
supportsCustomEditor
()
Determines whether this property editor supports a custom editor.
Method Details
setValue
void
setValue
(
Object
value)
Set (or change) the object that is to be edited.  Primitive types such
 as "int" must be wrapped as the corresponding object type such as
 "java.lang.Integer".
Parameters:
value
- The new target object to be edited.  Note that this
     object should not be modified by the PropertyEditor, rather
     the PropertyEditor should create a new object to hold any
     modified value.
getValue
Object
getValue
()
Gets the property value.
Returns:
The value of the property.  Primitive types such as "int" will
 be wrapped as the corresponding object type such as "java.lang.Integer".
isPaintable
boolean
isPaintable
()
Determines whether this property editor is paintable.
Returns:
True if the class will honor the paintValue method.
paintValue
void
paintValue
(
Graphics
gfx,
Rectangle
box)
Paint a representation of the value into a given area of screen
 real estate.  Note that the propertyEditor is responsible for doing
 its own clipping so that it fits into the given rectangle.
If the PropertyEditor doesn't honor paint requests (see isPaintable)
 this method should be a silent noop.
The given Graphics object will have the default font, color, etc of
 the parent container.  The PropertyEditor may change graphics attributes
 such as font and color and doesn't need to restore the old values.
Parameters:
gfx
- Graphics object to paint into.
box
- Rectangle within graphics object into which we should paint.
getJavaInitializationString
String
getJavaInitializationString
()
Returns a fragment of Java code that can be used to set a property
 to match the editors current state. This method is intended
 for use when generating Java code to reflect changes made through the
 property editor.
The code fragment should be context free and must be a legal Java
 expression as specified by the JLS.
Specifically, if the expression represents a computation then all
 classes and static members should be fully qualified. This rule
 applies to constructors, static methods and non primitive arguments.
Caution should be used when evaluating the expression as it may throw
 exceptions. In particular, code generators must ensure that generated
 code will compile in the presence of an expression that can throw
 checked exceptions.
Example results are:
Primitive expression:
2
Class constructor:
new java.awt.Color(127,127,34)
Static field:
java.awt.Color.orange
Static method:
javax.swing.Box.createRigidArea(new
                                   java.awt.Dimension(0, 5))
Returns:
a fragment of Java code representing an initializer for the
         current value. It should not contain a semi-colon
         ('
;
') to end the expression.
getAsText
String
getAsText
()
Gets the property value as text.
Returns:
The property value as a human editable string.
Returns null if the value can't be expressed as an editable string.
If a non-null value is returned, then the PropertyEditor should
       be prepared to parse that string back in setAsText().
setAsText
void
setAsText
(
String
text)
throws
IllegalArgumentException
Set the property value by parsing a given String.  May raise
 java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if either the String is
 badly formatted or if this kind of property can't be expressed
 as text.
Parameters:
text
- The string to be parsed.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
getTags
String
[]
getTags
()
If the property value must be one of a set of known tagged values,
 then this method should return an array of the tags.  This can
 be used to represent (for example) enum values.  If a PropertyEditor
 supports tags, then it should support the use of setAsText with
 a tag value as a way of setting the value and the use of getAsText
 to identify the current value.
Returns:
The tag values for this property.  May be null if this
   property cannot be represented as a tagged value.
getCustomEditor
Component
getCustomEditor
()
A PropertyEditor may choose to make available a full custom Component
 that edits its property value.  It is the responsibility of the
 PropertyEditor to hook itself up to its editor Component itself and
 to report property value changes by firing a PropertyChange event.
The higher-level code that calls getCustomEditor may either embed
 the Component in some larger property sheet, or it may put it in
 its own individual dialog, or ...
Returns:
A java.awt.Component that will allow a human to directly
      edit the current property value.  May be null if this is
      not supported.
supportsCustomEditor
boolean
supportsCustomEditor
()
Determines whether this property editor supports a custom editor.
Returns:
True if the propertyEditor can provide a custom editor.
addPropertyChangeListener
void
addPropertyChangeListener
(
PropertyChangeListener
listener)
Adds a listener for the value change.
 When the property editor changes its value
 it should fire a
PropertyChangeEvent
on all registered
PropertyChangeListener
s,
 specifying the
null
value for the property name
 and itself as the source.
Parameters:
listener
- the
PropertyChangeListener
to add
removePropertyChangeListener
void
removePropertyChangeListener
(
PropertyChangeListener
listener)
Removes a listener for the value change.
Parameters:
listener
- the
PropertyChangeListener
to remove
