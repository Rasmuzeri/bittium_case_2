Class StreamPrintService
java.lang.Object
javax.print.StreamPrintService
All Implemented Interfaces:
PrintService
public abstract class
StreamPrintService
extends
Object
implements
PrintService
This class extends
PrintService
and represents a print service that
 prints data in different formats to a client-provided output stream. This is
 principally intended for services where the output format is a document type
 suitable for viewing or archiving. The output format must be declared as a
 mime type. This is equivalent to an output document flavor where the
 representation class is always "java.io.OutputStream" An instance of the
StreamPrintService
class is obtained from a
StreamPrintServiceFactory
instance.
Note that a
StreamPrintService
is different from a
PrintService
, which supports a
Destination
attribute. A
StreamPrintService
always requires an output stream, whereas a
PrintService
optionally accepts a
Destination
. A
StreamPrintService
has no default destination for its formatted
 output. Additionally a
StreamPrintService
is expected to generate
 output in a format useful in other contexts.
StreamPrintService
's are
 not expected to support the
Destination
attribute.

Constructor Details
StreamPrintService
protected
StreamPrintService
(
OutputStream
out)
Constructs a
StreamPrintService
object.
Parameters:
out
- stream to which to send formatted print data
Method Details
getOutputStream
public
OutputStream
getOutputStream
()
Gets the output stream.
Returns:
the stream to which this service will send formatted print data
getOutputFormat
public abstract
String
getOutputFormat
()
Returns the document format emitted by this print service. Must be in
 mimetype format, compatible with the mime type components of
DocFlavors
Returns:
mime type identifying the output format
See Also:
DocFlavor
dispose
public
void
dispose
()
Disposes this
StreamPrintService
. If a stream service cannot be
 re-used, it must be disposed to indicate this. Typically the client will
 call this method. Services which write data which cannot meaningfully be
 appended to may also dispose the stream. This does not close the stream.
 It just marks it as not for further use by this service.
isDisposed
public
boolean
isDisposed
()
Returns a
boolean
indicating whether or not this
StreamPrintService
has been disposed. If this object has been
 disposed, will return
true
. Used by services and client
 applications to recognize streams to which no further data should be
 written.
Returns:
true
if this
StreamPrintService
has been
         disposed;
false
otherwise
