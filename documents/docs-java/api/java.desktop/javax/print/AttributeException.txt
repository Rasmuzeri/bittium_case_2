Interface AttributeException
public interface
AttributeException
Interface
AttributeException
is a mixin interface which a subclass of
PrintException
can implement to report an error
 condition involving one or more printing attributes that a particular Print
 Service instance does not support. Either the attribute is not supported at
 all, or the attribute is supported but the particular specified value is not
 supported. The Print Service API does not define any print exception classes
 that implement interface
AttributeException
, that being left to the
 Print Service implementor's discretion.
