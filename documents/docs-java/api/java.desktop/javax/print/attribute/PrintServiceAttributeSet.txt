Interface PrintServiceAttributeSet
All Superinterfaces:
AttributeSet
All Known Implementing Classes:
HashPrintServiceAttributeSet
public interface
PrintServiceAttributeSet
extends
AttributeSet
Interface
PrintServiceAttributeSet
specifies the interface for a set
 of print job attributes, i.e. printing attributes that implement interface
PrintServiceAttribute
. In the Print Service
 API, the Print Service instance uses a
PrintServiceAttributeSet
to
 report the status of the print service.
A
PrintServiceAttributeSet
is just an
AttributeSet
whose constructors and mutating operations
 guarantee an additional invariant, namely that all attribute values in the
PrintServiceAttributeSet
must be instances of interface
PrintServiceAttribute
. The
add(Attribute)
, and
addAll(AttributeSet)
operations are respecified
 below to guarantee this additional invariant.

Method Details
add
boolean
add
(
Attribute
attribute)
Adds the specified attribute value to this attribute set if it is not
 already present, first removing any existing value in the same attribute
 category as the specified attribute value (optional operation).
Specified by:
add
in interface
AttributeSet
Parameters:
attribute
- attribute value to be added to this attribute set
Returns:
true
if this attribute set changed as a result of the
         call, i.e., the given attribute value was not already a member of
         this attribute set
Throws:
UnmodifiableSetException
- if this attribute set does not support
         the
add()
operation
ClassCastException
- if the
attribute
is not an instance of
         interface
PrintServiceAttribute
NullPointerException
- if the
attribute
is
null
addAll
boolean
addAll
(
AttributeSet
attributes)
Adds all of the elements in the specified set to this attribute. The
 outcome is the same as if the
add(Attribute)
operation had been applied to this attribute set successively with each
 element from the specified set. If none of the categories in the
 specified set are the same as any categories in this attribute set, the
addAll()
operation effectively modifies this attribute set so
 that its value is the
union
of the two sets.
The behavior of the
addAll()
operation is unspecified if the
 specified set is modified while the operation is in progress.
If the
addAll()
operation throws an exception, the effect on this
 attribute set's state is implementation dependent; elements from the
 specified set before the point of the exception may or may not have been
 added to this attribute set.
Specified by:
addAll
in interface
AttributeSet
Parameters:
attributes
- whose elements are to be added to this attribute set
Returns:
true
if this attribute set changed as a result of the
         call
Throws:
UnmodifiableSetException
- if this attribute set does not support
         the
addAll()
method
ClassCastException
- if some element in the specified set is not an
         instance of interface
PrintServiceAttribute
NullPointerException
- if the specified set is
null
