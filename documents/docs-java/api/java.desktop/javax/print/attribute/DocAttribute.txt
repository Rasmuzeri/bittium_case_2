public interface
DocAttribute
extends
Attribute
Interface
DocAttribute
is a tagging interface which a printing
 attribute class implements to indicate the attribute denotes a setting for a
 doc. ("Doc" is a short, easy-to-pronounce term that means "a piece of print
 data.") The client may include a
DocAttribute
in a
Doc
's
 attribute set to specify a characteristic of that doc. If an attribute
 implements
PrintRequestAttribute
as well as
DocAttribute
, the client may include the attribute in a attribute set
 which specifies a print job to specify a characteristic for all the docs in
 that job.
