public final class
DateTimeAtCreation
extends
DateTimeSyntax
implements
PrintJobAttribute
Class
DateTimeAtCreation
is a printing attribute class, a date-time
 attribute, that indicates the date and time at which the Print Job was
 created.
To construct a
DateTimeAtCreation
attribute from separate values of
 the year, month, day, hour, minute, and so on, use a
Calendar
object to construct a
Date
object,
 then use the
Date
object to construct the DateTimeAtCreation
 attribute. To convert a
DateTimeAtCreation
attribute to separate
 values of the year, month, day, hour, minute, and so on, create a
Calendar
object and set it to the
Date
from the
DateTimeAtCreation
attribute.
IPP Compatibility:
The information needed to construct an IPP
 "date-time-at-creation" attribute can be obtained as described above. The
 category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
