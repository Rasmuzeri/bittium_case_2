Attribute
Class
PrinterStateReason
is a printing attribute class, an
 enumeration, that provides additional information about the printer's current
 state, i.e., information that augments the value of the printer's
PrinterState
attribute. Class PrinterStateReason defines
 standard printer state reason values. A Print Service implementation only
 needs to report those printer state reasons which are appropriate for the
 particular implementation; it does not have to report every defined printer
 state reason.
Instances of
PrinterStateReason
do not appear in a Print Service's
 attribute set directly. Rather, a
PrinterStateReasons
attribute appears in the
 Print Service's attribute set. The
PrinterStateReasons
attribute contains zero, one,
 or more than one
PrinterStateReason
objects which pertain to the
 Print Service's status, and each PrinterStateReason object is associated with
 a
Severity
level of
REPORT
(least severe),
WARNING
, or
ERROR
(most severe). The printer adds a
PrinterStateReason
object to the Print Service's
PrinterStateReasons
attribute when the
 corresponding condition becomes true of the printer, and the printer removes
 the
PrinterStateReason
object again when the corresponding condition
 becomes false, regardless of whether the Print Service's overall
PrinterState
also changed.
IPP Compatibility:
The string values returned by each individual
PrinterStateReason
and associated
Severity
object's
toString()
methods, concatenated together with a hyphen (
"-"
)
 in between, gives the IPP keyword value for a
PrinterStateReasons
.
 The category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.

OTHER
public static final
PrinterStateReason
OTHER
The printer has detected an error other than ones listed below.
MEDIA_NEEDED
public static final
PrinterStateReason
MEDIA_NEEDED
A tray has run out of media.
MEDIA_JAM
public static final
PrinterStateReason
MEDIA_JAM
The device has a media jam.
MOVING_TO_PAUSED
public static final
PrinterStateReason
MOVING_TO_PAUSED
Someone has paused the printer, but the device(s) are taking an
 appreciable time to stop. Later, when all output has stopped, the
PrinterState
becomes
STOPPED
, and the
PAUSED
value replaces the
MOVING_TO_PAUSED
value in the
PrinterStateReasons
attribute. This value
 must be supported if the printer can be paused and the implementation
 takes significant time to pause a device in certain circumstances.
PAUSED
public static final
PrinterStateReason
PAUSED
Someone has paused the printer and the printer's
PrinterState
is
STOPPED
. In this state, a
 printer must not produce printed output, but it must perform other
 operations requested by a client. If a printer had been printing a job
 when the printer was paused, the
Printer
must resume printing
 that job when the printer is no longer paused and leave no evidence in
 the printed output of such a pause. This value must be supported if the
 printer can be paused.
SHUTDOWN
public static final
PrinterStateReason
SHUTDOWN
Someone has removed a printer from service, and the device may be powered
 down or physically removed. In this state, a printer must not produce
 printed output, and unless the printer is realized by a print server that
 is still active, the printer must perform no other operations requested
 by a client. If a printer had been printing a job when it was shut down,
 the printer need not resume printing that job when the printer is no
 longer shut down. If the printer resumes printing such a job, it may
 leave evidence in the printed output of such a shutdown, e.g. the part
 printed before the shutdown may be printed a second time after the
 shutdown.
CONNECTING_TO_DEVICE
public static final
PrinterStateReason
CONNECTING_TO_DEVICE
The printer has scheduled a job on the output device and is in the
 process of connecting to a shared network output device (and might not be
 able to actually start printing the job for an arbitrarily long time
 depending on the usage of the output device by other servers on the
 network).
TIMED_OUT
public static final
PrinterStateReason
TIMED_OUT
The server was able to connect to the output device (or is always
 connected), but was unable to get a response from the output device.
STOPPING
public static final
PrinterStateReason
STOPPING
The printer is in the process of stopping the device and will be stopped
 in a while. When the device is stopped, the printer will change the
PrinterState
to
STOPPED
. The
STOPPING
reason is never an error, even for a printer with a
 single output device. When an output device ceases accepting jobs, the
 printer's
PrinterStateReasons
will have this
 reason while the output device completes printing.
STOPPED_PARTLY
public static final
PrinterStateReason
STOPPED_PARTLY
When a printer controls more than one output device, this reason
 indicates that one or more output devices are stopped. If the reason's
 severity is a report, fewer than half of the output devices are stopped.
 If the reason's severity is a warning, half or more but fewer than all of
 the output devices are stopped.
TONER_LOW
public static final
PrinterStateReason
TONER_LOW
The device is low on toner.
TONER_EMPTY
public static final
PrinterStateReason
TONER_EMPTY
The device is out of toner.
SPOOL_AREA_FULL
public static final
PrinterStateReason
SPOOL_AREA_FULL
The limit of persistent storage allocated for spooling has been reached.
 The printer is temporarily unable to accept more jobs. The printer will
 remove this reason when it is able to accept more jobs. This value should
 be used by a non-spooling printer that only accepts one or a small number
 jobs at a time or a spooling printer that has filled the spool space.
COVER_OPEN
public static final
PrinterStateReason
COVER_OPEN
One or more covers on the device are open.
INTERLOCK_OPEN
public static final
