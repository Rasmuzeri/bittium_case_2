Class
JobMediaSheetsSupported
is a printing attribute class, a set of
 integers, that gives the supported values for a
JobMediaSheets
attribute. It is restricted to a single
 contiguous range of integers; multiple non-overlapping ranges are not
 allowed. This gives the lower and upper bounds of the total sizes of print
 jobs in number of media sheets that the printer will accept.
IPP Compatibility:
The
JobMediaSheetsSupported
attribute's
 canonical array form gives the lower and upper bound for the range of values
 to be included in an IPP "job-media-sheets-supported" attribute. See class
SetOfIntegerSyntax
for an explanation of canonical
 array form. The category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP
 attribute name.
