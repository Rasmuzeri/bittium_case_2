Attribute
Class
Severity
is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that
 denotes the severity of a
PrinterStateReason
attribute.
Instances of
Severity
do not appear in a Print Service's attribute
 set directly. Rather, a
PrinterStateReasons
attribute appears in the Print Service's attribute set.
 The
PrinterStateReasons
attribute contains zero,
 one, or more than one
PrinterStateReason
objects
 which pertain to the Print Service's status, and each
PrinterStateReason
object is associated with a
 Severity level of
REPORT
(least severe),
WARNING
, or
ERROR
(most severe). The printer adds a
PrinterStateReason
object to the Print Service's
PrinterStateReasons
attribute when the
 corresponding condition becomes true of the printer, and the printer removes
 the
PrinterStateReason
object again when the
 corresponding condition becomes false, regardless of whether the Print
 Service's overall
PrinterState
also changed.
IPP Compatibility:
Severity.toString()
returns either "error",
 "warning", or "report". The string values returned by each individual
PrinterStateReason
and associated
Severity
object's
toString()
methods, concatenated together with a hyphen (
"-"
)
 in between, gives the IPP keyword value for a
PrinterStateReasons
.
 The category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.

Field Details
REPORT
public static final
Severity
REPORT
Indicates that the
PrinterStateReason
is a
 "report" (least severe). An implementation may choose to omit some or all
 reports. Some reports specify finer granularity about the printer state;
 others serve as a precursor to a warning. A report must contain nothing
 that could affect the printed output.
WARNING
public static final
Severity
WARNING
Indicates that the
PrinterStateReason
is a
 "warning." An implementation may choose to omit some or all warnings.
 Warnings serve as a precursor to an error. A warning must contain nothing
 that prevents a job from completing, though in some cases the output may
 be of lower quality.
ERROR
public static final
Severity
ERROR
Indicates that the
PrinterStateReason
is an
 "error" (most severe). An implementation must include all errors. If this
 attribute contains one or more errors, the printer's
PrinterState
must be
STOPPED
