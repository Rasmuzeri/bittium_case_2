public final class

extends
URISyntax
implements
PrintServiceAttribute
Class
PrinterMoreInfoManufacturer
is a printing attribute class, a
URI
, that is used to obtain more information about this type of
 device. The information obtained from this
URI
is intended for end
 user consumption. Features outside the scope of the Print Service API can be
 accessed from this
URI
(e.g., latest firmware, upgrades, service
 proxies, optional features available, details on color support). The
 information is intended to be germane to this kind of printer without regard
 to site specific modifications or services.
In contrast, the
PrinterMoreInfo
attribute is used to
 find out more information about this specific printer rather than this
 general kind of printer.
IPP Compatibility:
The string form returned by
toString()
gives the IPP uri value. The category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
