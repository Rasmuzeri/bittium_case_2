Class
OutputDeviceAssigned
is a printing attribute class, a text
 attribute, that identifies the output device to which the service has
 assigned this job. If an output device implements an embedded Print Service
 instance, the printer need not set this attribute. If a print server
 implements a Print Service instance, the value may be empty (zero- length
 string) or not returned until the service assigns an output device to the
 job. This attribute is particularly useful when a single service supports
 multiple devices (so called "fan-out").
IPP Compatibility:
The string value gives the IPP name value. The
 locale gives the IPP natural language. The category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
