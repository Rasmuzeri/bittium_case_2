Class
PresentationDirection
is a printing attribute class, an
 enumeration, that is used in conjunction with the
NumberUp
attribute to indicate the layout of multiple print-stream pages to impose
 upon a single side of an instance of a selected medium. This is useful to
 mirror the text layout conventions of different scripts. For example, English
 is "toright-tobottom", Hebrew is "toleft-tobottom" and Japanese is usually
 "tobottom-toleft".
IPP Compatibility:
This attribute is not an IPP 1.1 attribute; it is
 an attribute in the Production Printing Extension
 (
PDF
) of IPP 1.1. The category name returned by
getName()
is the
 IPP attribute name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum value.
 The
toString()
method returns the IPP string representation of the
 attribute value.
