public final class
DateTimeAtCompleted

implements
PrintJobAttribute
Class
DateTimeAtCompleted
is a printing attribute class, a date-time
 attribute, that indicates the date and time at which the Print Job completed
 (or was canceled or aborted).
To construct a
DateTimeAtCompleted
attribute from separate values of
 the year, month, day, hour, minute, and so on, use a
Calendar
object to construct a
Date
object,
 then use the
Date
object to construct the DateTimeAtCompleted
 attribute. To convert a
DateTimeAtCompleted
attribute to separate
 values of the year, month, day, hour, minute, and so on, create a
Calendar
object and set it to the
Date
from the
DateTimeAtCompleted
attribute.
IPP Compatibility:
The information needed to construct an IPP
 "date-time-at-completed" attribute can be obtained as described above. The
 category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
