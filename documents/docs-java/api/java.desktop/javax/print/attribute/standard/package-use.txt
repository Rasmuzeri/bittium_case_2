 class (an enumeration) that specifies the media for a print job as a name.
MediaSize
Class
MediaSize
is a two-dimensional size valued printing attribute
 class that indicates the dimensions of the medium in a portrait orientation,
 with the

 enumeration, that controls finishing operations and the placement of one or
 more print-stream pages into impressions and onto media sheets.
OrientationRequested
Class

is a printing attribute class, an
 enumeration, that indicates the desired orientation for printed print-stream
 pages; it does not describe the orientation of the client-supplied
 print-stream pages.
PDLOverrideSupported
Class
PDLOverrideSupported
is a printing attribute class, an
 enumeration, that expresses the printer's ability to attempt to override
 processing instructions embedded in documents' print data with processing
 instructions specified as attributes outside the print data.

Class
PresentationDirection
is a printing attribute class, an
 enumeration, that is used in conjunction with the
NumberUp
attribute to indicate the layout of multiple print-stream pages to impose
 upon a single side of an instance of a selected medium.
PrinterIsAcceptingJobs
Class
PrinterIsAcceptingJobs
is a printing attribute class, an
 enumeration, that indicates whether the printer is currently able to accept
 jobs.
PrinterState
Class
PrinterState
is a printing attribute class, an enumeration,
 that identifies the current state of a printer.
PrinterStateReason
Class
PrinterStateReason
is a printing attribute class, an
 enumeration, that provides additional information about the printer's current
 state, i.e., information that augments the value of the printer's
PrinterState
attribute.

 denotes the severity of a
PrinterStateReason
attribute.
SheetCollate
Class
SheetCollate
is a printing attribute class, an enumeration,

 document in a job are to be in sequence, when multiple copies of the document
 are specified by the
Copies
attribute.
