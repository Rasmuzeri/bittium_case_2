PrintServiceAttribute
Class
PrinterState
is a printing attribute class, an enumeration,
 that identifies the current state of a printer. Class
PrinterState
defines standard printer state values. A Print Service implementation only
 needs to report those printer states which are appropriate for the particular
 implementation; it does not have to report every defined printer state. The
PrinterStateReasons
attribute augments the
PrinterState
attribute to give more detailed information about the
 printer in given printer state.
IPP Compatibility:
The category name returned by
getName()
is
 the IPP attribute name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum
 value. The
toString()
method returns the IPP string representation of
 the attribute value.
