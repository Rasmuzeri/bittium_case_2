Class
Fidelity
is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that
 indicates whether total fidelity to client supplied print request attributes
 is required. If
FIDELITY_TRUE
is specified and a service cannot print
 the job exactly as specified it must reject the job. If
FIDELITY_FALSE
is specified a reasonable attempt to print the job is
 acceptable. If not supplied the default is
FIDELITY_FALSE
.
IPP Compatibility:
The IPP boolean value is "true" for
FIDELITY_TRUE
and "false" for
FIDELITY_FALSE
. The category
 name returned by
getName()
is the IPP attribute name. The
 enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum value. The
toString()
method returns the IPP string representation of the attribute value. See
RFC 2911
Section 15.1 for a
 fuller description of the IPP fidelity attribute.
