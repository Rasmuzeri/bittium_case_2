Class
JobMediaSheets
is an integer valued printing attribute class
 that specifies the total number of media sheets to be produced for this job.
The
JobMediaSheets
attribute describes the size of the job. This
 attribute is not intended to be a counter; it is intended to be useful
 routing and scheduling information if known. The printer may try to compute
 the
JobMediaSheets
attribute's value if it is not supplied in the
 Print Request. Even if the client does supply a value for the
JobMediaSheets
attribute in the Print Request, the printer may choose
 to change the value if the printer is able to compute a value which is more
 accurate than the client supplied value. The printer may be able to determine
 the correct value for the
JobMediaSheets
attribute either right at
 job submission time or at any later point in time.
Unlike the
JobKOctets
and
JobImpressions
attributes, the
JobMediaSheets
value must include the multiplicative factors contributed by the number of
 copies specified by the
Copies
attribute and a "number of
 copies" instruction embedded in the document data, if any. This difference
 allows the system administrator to control the lower and upper bounds of both
 (1) the size of the document(s) with
JobKOctetsSupported
and
JobImpressionsSupported
and (2) the size of
 the job with
JobMediaSheetsSupported
.
IPP Compatibility:
The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
 category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
