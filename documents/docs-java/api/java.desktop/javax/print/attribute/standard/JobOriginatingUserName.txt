PrintJobAttribute
Class
JobOriginatingUserName
is a printing attribute class, a text
 attribute, that contains the name of the end user that submitted the print
 job. If possible, the printer sets this attribute to the most authenticated
 printable user name that it can obtain from the authentication service that
 authenticated the submitted Print Request. If such is not available, the
 printer uses the value of the
RequestingUserName
attribute supplied by the client in the Print Request's attribute set. If no
 authentication service is available, and the client did not supply a
RequestingUserName
attribute, the printer sets the
 JobOriginatingUserName attribute to an empty (zero-length) string.
IPP Compatibility:
The string value gives the IPP name value. The
 locale gives the IPP natural language. The category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
