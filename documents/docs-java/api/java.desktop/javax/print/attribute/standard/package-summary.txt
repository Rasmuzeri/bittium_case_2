Package javax.print.attribute.standard
package
javax.print.attribute.standard
Package
javax.print.attribute.standard
contains classes for specific
 printing attributes. The parent package,
javax.print.attribute
, provides classes and interfaces that describe the
 types of Java Print Service attributes and how they can be collected into
 attribute sets.
An attribute represents a printing feature that a print service can provide.
 For each attribute, a print service either does or does not support the
 attribute. For each possible value of a supported attribute, a print service
 either does or does not support the value.
The API requires every print service to support certain attributes; other
 attributes are optional and the service can choose whether or not to support
 them. Each attribute has a set of values that it accepts. The API requires
 every print service to support certain values for certain attributes; other
 attribute values are optional and the service can choose whether or not to
 support them. These support requirements are recorded in the documentation
 for each attribute class.
Package
javax.print.attribute.standard
contains standard printing
 attributes and standard printing attribute values that are widely used in the
 printing domain. A print service vendor can provide new vendor-specific
 printing attributes in addition to the standard ones. A vendor can also
 provide vendor-specific extensions (subclasses) of the standard printing
 attributes -- for example, to provide additional vendor-specific values for
 an existing standard attribute. Of course, if a vendor wants clients to be
 able to use any added or extended attributes, the vendor must publish the new
 attribute classes.
Many of the standard attribute classes extend one of the abstract syntax
 classes of the
javax.print.attribute
package. These abstract syntax
 classes each represent a different type. The
EnumSyntax
class, for example, represents a type-safe enumeration. The
 abstract syntax class provides a wrapper for the attribute value.
If an attribute class extends
EnumSyntax
, and the value of the
 attribute is an IPP-compatible value, the attribute's
toString
method
 returns the IPP string representation of the attribute value, such as
 "processing-stopped" for the
JobState
attribute.
 However, because the
EnumSyntax
class is extensible, vendors can
 define their own attribute values. If an attribute uses the
EnumSyntax
class and is set to one of these vendor-defined values
 then the
toString
method will not return the IPP string
 representation of the value.
A printing client application will typically not need to use all the printing
 attribute classes in package javax.print.attribute.standard, just the ones
 that pertain to the application.
The attribute classes in package
javax.print.attribute.standard
are
 based on the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) attributes as defined in the
 Internet RFC document,
RFC 2911 Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and
 Semantics
dated September 2000. See
RFC 2911
for more
 information. The descriptive text for each attribute class was taken largely
 from the above documents. The above authors' contribution to the API is
 gratefully acknowledged.
Attribute Organization
There are five kinds of printing attributes: doc attributes, print request
 attributes, print job attributes, print service attributes, and
 supported-values attributes.
Doc Attributes
Doc attributes specify the characteristics of an individual doc and the print
 job settings to be applied to an individual doc. A doc attribute class
 implements interface
DocAttribute
. A doc
 attribute can appear in a
DocAttributeSet
.
Print Request Attributes
Print request attributes specify the settings to be applied to a whole print
 job and to all the docs in the print job. A print request attribute class
 implements interface
PrintRequestAttribute
. A print request attribute can appear in a
PrintRequestAttributeSet
.
Some attributes are doc attributes but not print request attributes and may
 only be specified at the doc level. Some attributes are print request
 attributes but not doc attributes and may only be specified at the Print
 Request level. Some attributes are both doc attributes and print request
 attributes and may be specified either at the doc level or at the Print
 Request level.
When specified at the doc level, an attribute applies just to that one doc.
 When specified at the Print Request level, an attribute applies to the whole
 job, including all the docs in the job. However, an attribute specified at
 the doc level overrides an attribute in the same category specified at the
 Print Request level.
Print Job Attributes
Print job attributes report the status of a Print Job. A print job attribute
 class implements interface
PrintJobAttribute
. A print job attribute can appear in a
PrintJobAttributeSet
.
Some attributes are both print request attributes and print job attributes; a
 client may include such attributes in a Print Request to specify
 characteristics for the ensuing Print Job, and those attributes then also
 appear in the Print Job's attribute set. Some attributes are print job
 attributes but not print request attributes; the print service itself adds
 these attributes to the Print Job's attribute set.
Print Service Attributes
Print service attributes report the status of a print service. A print
 service attribute class implements interface
PrintServiceAttribute
. A print
 service attribute can appear in a
PrintServiceAttributeSet
.
Supported-Values Attributes
A supported-value attribute indicates the legal values for another attribute
 that a print service supports. A supported-values attribute class implements
 interface
SupportedValuesAttribute
. However, supported-values attributes never
 appear in attribute sets, so there is no restricted
AttributeSet
subinterface for them.
Attribute Table
The table below lists all the printing attributes. The table shows the
 tagging interfaces each attribute class implements in addition to interface
Attribute
, thus indicating how each
 attribute is used in the API. For each doc attribute and print request
 attribute, the column marked "SupportedValuesAttribute" lists the
 supported-values attribute class, if any, with which a print service
 indicates the supported values for that attribute category.
Lists all printing attributes as described above

Please note: In the
javax.print
APIs, a
null
reference
 parameter to methods is incorrect unless explicitly documented on the method
 as having a meaningful interpretation. Usage to the contrary is incorrect
 coding and may result in a run time exception either immediately or at some
 later time.
IllegalArgumentException
and
NullPointerException
are examples of typical and acceptable run time exceptions for such cases.
