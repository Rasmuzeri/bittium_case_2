Attribute
Class
JobStateReason
is a printing attribute class, an enumeration,
 that provides additional information about the job's current state, i.e.,
 information that augments the value of the job's
JobState
attribute. Class
JobStateReason
defines standard job state reason
 values. A Print Service implementation only needs to report those job state
 reasons which are appropriate for the particular implementation; it does not
 have to report every defined job state reason.
Instances of
JobStateReason
do not appear in a Print Job's attribute
 set directly. Rather, a
JobStateReasons
attribute
 appears in the Print Job's attribute set. The
JobStateReasons
attribute contains zero, one, or more
 than one
JobStateReason
objects which pertain to the Print Job's
 status. The printer adds a JobStateReason object to the Print Job's
JobStateReasons
attribute when the corresponding
 condition becomes true of the Print Job, and the printer removes the
JobStateReason
object again when the corresponding condition becomes
 false, regardless of whether the Print Job's overall
JobState
also changed.
IPP Compatibility:
The category name returned by
getName()
is
 the IPP attribute name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum
 value. The
toString()
method returns the IPP string representation of
 the attribute value.

Field Details
JOB_INCOMING
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_INCOMING
The printer has created the Print Job, but the printer has not finished
 accessing or accepting all the print data yet.
JOB_DATA_INSUFFICIENT
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_DATA_INSUFFICIENT
The printer has created the Print Job, but the printer is expecting
 additional print data before it can move the job into the
PROCESSING
state. If a printer starts processing before it has
 received all data, the printer removes the
JOB_DATA_INSUFFICIENT
reason, but the
JOB_INCOMING
reason remains. If a printer starts
 processing after it has received all data, the printer removes the
JOB_DATA_INSUFFICIENT
and
JOB_INCOMING
reasons at the
 same time.
DOCUMENT_ACCESS_ERROR
public static final
JobStateReason
DOCUMENT_ACCESS_ERROR
The printer could not access one or more documents passed by reference
 (i.e., the print data representation object is a
URL
). This
 reason is intended to cover any file access problem, including file does
 not exist and access denied because of an access control problem. Whether
 the printer aborts the job and moves the job to the
ABORTED
job
 state or prints all documents that are accessible and moves the job to
 the
COMPLETED
job state and adds the
COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS
reason to the job's
JobStateReasons
attribute depends on
 implementation and/or site policy. This value should be supported if the
 printer supports doc flavors with
URL
print data representation
 objects.
SUBMISSION_INTERRUPTED
public static final
JobStateReason
SUBMISSION_INTERRUPTED
The job was not completely submitted for some unforeseen reason.
 Possibilities include (1) the printer has crashed before the job was
 fully submitted by the client, (2) the printer or the document transfer
 method has crashed in some non-recoverable way before the document data
 was entirely transferred to the printer, (3) the client crashed before
 the job was fully submitted.
JOB_OUTGOING
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_OUTGOING
The printer is transmitting the job to the output device.
JOB_HOLD_UNTIL_SPECIFIED
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_HOLD_UNTIL_SPECIFIED
The value of the job's
JobHoldUntil
attribute was
 specified with a date-time that is still in the future. The job must not
 be a candidate for processing until this reason is removed and there are
 no other reasons to hold the job. This value should be supported if the
JobHoldUntil
job template attribute is supported.
RESOURCES_ARE_NOT_READY
public static final
JobStateReason
RESOURCES_ARE_NOT_READY
At least one of the resources needed by the job, such as media, fonts,
 resource objects, etc., is not ready on any of the physical printers for
 which the job is a candidate. This condition may be detected when the job
 is accepted, or subsequently while the job is pending or processing,
 depending on implementation. The job may remain in its current state or
 be moved to the
PENDING_HELD
state, depending on implementation
 and/or job scheduling policy.
PRINTER_STOPPED_PARTLY
public static final
JobStateReason
PRINTER_STOPPED_PARTLY
The value of the printer's
PrinterStateReasons
attribute contains a
PrinterStateReason
value of
STOPPED_PARTLY
.
PRINTER_STOPPED
public static final
JobStateReason
PRINTER_STOPPED
The value of the printer's
PrinterState
attribute ia
STOPPED
.
JOB_INTERPRETING
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_INTERPRETING
The job is in the
PROCESSING
state, but more specifically, the
 printer ia interpreting the document data.
JOB_QUEUED
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_QUEUED
The job is in the
PROCESSING
state, but more specifically, the
 printer has queued the document data.
JOB_TRANSFORMING
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_TRANSFORMING
The job is in the
PROCESSING
state, but more specifically, the
 printer is interpreting document data and producing another electronic
 representation.
JOB_QUEUED_FOR_MARKER
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_QUEUED_FOR_MARKER
The job is in the
PENDING_HELD
,
PENDING
, or
PROCESSING
state, but more specifically, the printer has
 completed enough processing of the document to be able to start marking
 and the job is waiting for the marker. Systems that require human
 intervention to release jobs put the job into the
PENDING_HELD
job state. Systems that automatically select a job to use the marker put
 the job into the
PENDING
job state or keep the job in the
PROCESSING
job state while waiting for the marker, depending on
 implementation. All implementations put the job into (or back into) the
PROCESSING
state when marking does begin.
JOB_PRINTING
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_PRINTING
The output device is marking media. This value is useful for printers
 which spend a great deal of time processing (1) when no marking is
 happening and then want to show that marking is now happening or (2) when
 the job is in the process of being canceled or aborted while the job
 remains in the
PROCESSING
state, but the marking has not yet
 stopped so that impression or sheet counts are still increasing for the
 job.
JOB_CANCELED_BY_USER
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_CANCELED_BY_USER
The job was canceled by the owner of the job, i.e., by a user whose
 authenticated identity is the same as the value of the originating user
 that created the Print Job, or by some other authorized end-user, such as
 a member of the job owner's security group. This value should be
 supported.
JOB_CANCELED_BY_OPERATOR
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_CANCELED_BY_OPERATOR
The job was canceled by the operator, i.e., by a user who has been
 authenticated as having operator privileges (whether local or remote). If
 the security policy is to allow anyone to cancel anyone's job, then this
 value may be used when the job is canceled by someone other than the
 owner of the job. For such a security policy, in effect, everyone is an
 operator as far as canceling jobs is concerned. This value should be
 supported if the implementation permits canceling by someone other than
 the owner of the job.
JOB_CANCELED_AT_DEVICE
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_CANCELED_AT_DEVICE
The job was canceled by an unidentified local user, i.e., a user at a
 console at the device. This value should be supported if the
 implementation supports canceling jobs at the console.
ABORTED_BY_SYSTEM
public static final
JobStateReason
ABORTED_BY_SYSTEM
The job was aborted by the system. Either the job (1) is in the process
 of being aborted, (2) has been aborted by the system and placed in the
ABORTED
state, or (3) has been aborted by the system and placed
 in the
PENDING_HELD
state, so that a user or operator can
 manually try the job again. This value should be supported.
UNSUPPORTED_COMPRESSION
public static final
JobStateReason
UNSUPPORTED_COMPRESSION
The job was aborted by the system because the printer determined while
 attempting to decompress the document's data that the compression is
 actually not among those supported by the printer. This value must be
 supported, since
Compression
is a required doc
 description attribute.
COMPRESSION_ERROR
public static final
JobStateReason
COMPRESSION_ERROR
The job was aborted by the system because the printer encountered an
 error in the document data while decompressing it. If the printer posts
 this reason, the document data has already passed any tests that would
 have led to the
UNSUPPORTED_COMPRESSION
job state reason.
UNSUPPORTED_DOCUMENT_FORMAT
public static final
JobStateReason
UNSUPPORTED_DOCUMENT_FORMAT
The job was aborted by the system because the document data's document
 format (doc flavor) is not among those supported by the printer. If the
 client specifies a doc flavor with a MIME type of
"application/octet-stream"
, the printer may abort the job if the
 printer cannot determine the document data's actual format through
 auto-sensing (even if the printer supports the document format if
 specified explicitly). This value must be supported, since a doc flavor
 is required to be specified for each doc.
DOCUMENT_FORMAT_ERROR
public static final
JobStateReason
DOCUMENT_FORMAT_ERROR
The job was aborted by the system because the printer encountered an
 error in the document data while processing it. If the printer posts this
 reason, the document data has already passed any tests that would have
 led to the
UNSUPPORTED_DOCUMENT_FORMAT
job state reason.
PROCESSING_TO_STOP_POINT
public static final
JobStateReason
PROCESSING_TO_STOP_POINT
The requester has canceled the job or the printer has aborted the job,
 but the printer is still performing some actions on the job until a
 specified stop point occurs or job termination/cleanup is completed.
If the implementation requires some measurable time to cancel the job in
 the
PROCESSING
or
PROCESSING_STOPPED
job states, the
 printer must use this reason to indicate that the printer is still
 performing some actions on the job while the job remains in the
PROCESSING
or
PROCESSING_STOPPED
state. After all the
 job's job description attributes have stopped incrementing, the printer
 moves the job from the PROCESSING state to the
CANCELED
or
ABORTED
job states.
SERVICE_OFF_LINE
public static final
JobStateReason
SERVICE_OFF_LINE
The printer is off-line and accepting no jobs. All
PENDING
jobs
 are put into the
PENDING_HELD
state. This situation could be true
 if the service's or document transform's input is impaired or broken.
JOB_COMPLETED_SUCCESSFULLY
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_COMPLETED_SUCCESSFULLY
The job completed successfully. This value should be supported.
JOB_COMPLETED_WITH_WARNINGS
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_COMPLETED_WITH_WARNINGS
The job completed with warnings. This value should be supported if the
 implementation detects warnings.
JOB_COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS
The job completed with errors (and possibly warnings too). This value
 should be supported if the implementation detects errors.
JOB_RESTARTABLE
public static final
JobStateReason
JOB_RESTARTABLE
This job is retained and is currently able to be restarted. If
JOB_RESTARTABLE
is contained in the job's
JobStateReasons
attribute, then the printer must
 accept a request to restart that job. This value should be supported if
 restarting jobs is supported.
[The capability for restarting jobs is
 not in the Java Print Service API at present.]
QUEUED_IN_DEVICE
public static final
JobStateReason
QUEUED_IN_DEVICE
The job has been forwarded to a device or print system that is unable to
 send back status. The printer sets the job's
JobState
attribute to
COMPLETED
and adds the
QUEUED_IN_DEVICE
reason to the job's
JobStateReasons
attribute to
 indicate that the printer has no additional information about the job and
 never will have any better information.
