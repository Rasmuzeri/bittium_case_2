Class
Finishings
is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that
 identifies whether the printer applies a finishing operation of some kind of
 binding to each copy of each printed document in the job. For multidoc print
 jobs (jobs with multiple documents), the
MultipleDocumentHandling
attribute
 determines what constitutes a "copy" for purposes of finishing.
Standard Finishings values are:
NONE
STAPLE
EDGE_STITCH
BIND
SADDLE_STITCH
COVER
The following
Finishings
values are more specific; they indicate a
 corner or an edge as if the document were a portrait document:
STAPLE_TOP_LEFT
EDGE_STITCH_LEFT
STAPLE_DUAL_LEFT
STAPLE_BOTTOM_LEFT
EDGE_STITCH_TOP
STAPLE_DUAL_TOP
STAPLE_TOP_RIGHT
EDGE_STITCH_RIGHT
STAPLE_DUAL_RIGHT
STAPLE_BOTTOM_RIGHT
EDGE_STITCH_BOTTOM
STAPLE_DUAL_BOTTOM
The STAPLE_
XXX
values are specified with respect to the document as if
 the document were a portrait document. If the document is actually a
 landscape or a reverse-landscape document, the client supplies the
 appropriate transformed value. For example, to position a staple in the upper
 left hand corner of a landscape document when held for reading, the client
 supplies the
STAPLE_BOTTOM_LEFT
value (since landscape is defined as
 a +90 degree rotation from portrait, i.e., anti-clockwise). On the other
 hand, to position a staple in the upper left hand corner of a
 reverse-landscape document when held for reading, the client supplies the
STAPLE_TOP_RIGHT
value (since reverse-landscape is defined as a -90
 degree rotation from portrait, i.e., clockwise).
The angle (vertical, horizontal, angled) of each staple with respect to the
 document depends on the implementation which may in turn depend on the value
 of the attribute.
The effect of a
Finishings
attribute on a multidoc print job (a job
 with multiple documents) depends on whether all the docs have the same
 binding specified or whether different docs have different bindings
 specified, and on the (perhaps defaulted) value of the
MultipleDocumentHandling
attribute.
If all the docs have the same binding specified, then any value of
MultipleDocumentHandling
makes sense, and
   the printer's processing depends on the
MultipleDocumentHandling
value:
SINGLE_DOCUMENT
-- All the input docs will be bound together
     as one output document with the specified binding.
SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET
-- All the input docs will be bound
     together as one output document with the specified binding, and the first
     impression of each input doc will always start on a new media sheet.
SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES
-- Each input doc will
     be bound separately with the specified binding.
SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES
-- Each input doc will be
     bound separately with the specified binding.
If different docs have different bindings specified, then only two
   values of
MultipleDocumentHandling
make
   sense, and the printer reports an error when the job is submitted if any
   other value is specified:
SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES
-- Each input doc will
     be bound separately with its own specified binding.
SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES
-- Each input doc will be
     bound separately with its own specified binding.
IPP Compatibility:
Class Finishings encapsulates some of the IPP enum
 values that can be included in an IPP "finishings" attribute, which is a set
 of enums. The category name returned by
getName()
is the IPP
 attribute name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum value. The
toString()
method returns the IPP string representation of the
 attribute value. In IPP Finishings is a multi-value attribute, this API
 currently allows only one binding to be specified.
