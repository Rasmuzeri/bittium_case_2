Class
PagesPerMinuteColor
is an integer valued printing attribute
 that indicates the nominal number of pages per minute to the nearest whole
 number which may be generated by this printer when printing color (e.g.,
 simplex, color). For purposes of this attribute, "color" means the same as
 for the
ColorSupported
attribute, namely, the device
 is capable of any type of color printing at all, including highlight color as
 well as full process color. This attribute is informative, not a service
 guarantee. Generally, it is the value used in the marketing literature to
 describe the color capabilities of this device. A value of 0 indicates a
 device that takes more than two minutes to process a page. If a color device
 has several color modes, it may use the pages-per- minute value for this
 attribute that corresponds to the mode that produces the highest number.
A black and white only printer must not include the
PagesPerMinuteColor
attribute in its attribute set or service
 registration. If this attribute is present, then the
ColorSupported
printer description attribute must also
 be present and have a value of
SUPPORTED
.
IPP Compatibility:
The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
 category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
