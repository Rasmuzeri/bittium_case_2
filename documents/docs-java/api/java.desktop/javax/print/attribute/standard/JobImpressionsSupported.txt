Class
JobImpressionsSupported
is a printing attribute class, a set of
 integers, that gives the supported values for a
JobImpressions
attribute. It is restricted to a single
 contiguous range of integers; multiple non-overlapping ranges are not
 allowed. This gives the lower and upper bounds of the total sizes of print
 jobs in number of impressions that the printer will accept.
IPP Compatibility:
The
JobImpressionsSupported
attribute's
 canonical array form gives the lower and upper bound for the range of values
 to be included in an IPP "job-impressions-supported" attribute. See class
SetOfIntegerSyntax
for an explanation of canonical
 array form. The category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP
 attribute name.

public
JobImpressionsSupported

 int upperBound)
Construct a new job impressions supported attribute containing a single
 range of integers. That is, only those values of
JobImpressions
in the one range are supported.
Parameters:
lowerBound
- lower bound of the range
upperBound
- upper bound of the range
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if a
null
range is specified or
         if a
non-null
range is specified with
lowerBound
less than zero

 the passed in object. To be equivalent, all of the following conditions
 must be true:
object
is not
null
.
object
is an instance of class
JobImpressionsSupported
.
