Class
JobKOctets
is an integer valued printing attribute class that
 specifies the total size of the document(s) in K octets, i.e., in units of
 1024 octets requested to be processed in the job. The value must be rounded
 up, so that a job between 1 and 1024 octets must be indicated as being 1K
 octets, 1025 to 2048 must be 2K octets, etc. For a multidoc print job (a job
 with multiple documents), the
JobKOctets
value is computed by adding
 up the individual documents' sizes in octets, then rounding up to the next K
 octets value.
The
JobKOctets
attribute describes the size of the job. This
 attribute is not intended to be a counter; it is intended to be useful
 routing and scheduling information if known. The printer may try to compute
 the
JobKOctets
attribute's value if it is not supplied in the Print
 Request. Even if the client does supply a value for the
JobKOctets
attribute in the Print Request, the printer may choose to change the value if
 the printer is able to compute a value which is more accurate than the client
 supplied value. The printer may be able to determine the correct value for
 the
JobKOctets
attribute either right at job submission time or at
 any later point in time.
The
JobKOctets
value must not include the multiplicative factors
 contributed by the number of copies specified by the
Copies
attribute, independent of whether the device can process multiple copies
 without making multiple passes over the job or document data and independent
 of whether the output is collated or not. Thus the value is independent of
 the implementation and indicates the size of the document(s) measured in K
 octets independent of the number of copies.
The
JobKOctets
value must also not include the multiplicative factor
 due to a copies instruction embedded in the document data. If the document
 data actually includes replications of the document data, this value will
 include such replication. In other words, this value is always the size of
 the source document data, rather than a measure of the hardcopy output to be
 produced.
The size of a doc is computed based on the print data representation class as
 specified by the doc's
DocFlavor
, as shown in
 the table below.

* In these cases the Print Service itself generates the print data sent
 to the printer. If the Print Service supports the
JobKOctets
attribute, for these cases the Print Service itself must calculate the size
 of the print data, replacing any
JobKOctets
value the client
 specified.
IPP Compatibility:
The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
 category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
