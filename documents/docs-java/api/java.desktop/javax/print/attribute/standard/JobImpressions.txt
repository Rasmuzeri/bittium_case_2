Class
JobImpressions
is an integer valued printing attribute class
 that specifies the total size in number of impressions of the document(s)
 being submitted. An "impression" is the image (possibly many print-stream
 pages in different configurations) imposed onto a single media page.
The
JobImpressions
attribute describes the size of the job. This
 attribute is not intended to be a counter; it is intended to be useful
 routing and scheduling information if known. The printer may try to compute
 the
JobImpressions
attribute's value if it is not supplied in the
 Print Request. Even if the client does supply a value for the
JobImpressions
attribute in the Print Request, the printer may choose
 to change the value if the printer is able to compute a value which is more
 accurate than the client supplied value. The printer may be able to determine
 the correct value for the
JobImpressions
attribute either right at
 job submission time or at any later point in time.
As with
JobKOctets
, the
JobImpressions
value must
 not include the multiplicative factors contributed by the number of copies
 specified by the
Copies
attribute, independent of whether the
 device can process multiple copies without making multiple passes over the
 job or document data and independent of whether the output is collated or
 not. Thus the value is independent of the implementation and reflects the
 size of the document(s) measured in impressions independent of the number of
 copies.
As with
JobKOctets
, the
JobImpressions
value must
 also not include the multiplicative factor due to a copies instruction
 embedded in the document data. If the document data actually includes
 replications of the document data, this value will include such replication.
 In other words, this value is always the number of impressions in the source
 document data, rather than a measure of the number of impressions to be
 produced by the job.
IPP Compatibility:
The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
 category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
