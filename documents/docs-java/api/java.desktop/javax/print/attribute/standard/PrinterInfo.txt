Class
PrinterInfo
is a printing attribute class, a text attribute,
 that provides descriptive information about a printer. This could include
 things like:
"This printer can be used for printing color
 transparencies for HR presentations"
, or
"Out of courtesy for others,
 please print only small (1-5 page) jobs at this printer"
, or even
"This printer is going away on July 1, 1997, please find a new
 printer"
.
IPP Compatibility:
The string value gives the IPP name value. The
 locale gives the IPP natural language. The category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
