Class
NumberUpSupported
is a printing attribute class, a set of
 integers, that gives the supported values for a
NumberUp
attribute.
IPP Compatibility:
The NumberUpSupported attribute's canonical array
 form gives the lower and upper bound for each range of number-up to be
 included in an IPP "number-up-supported" attribute. See class
SetOfIntegerSyntax
for an explanation of canonical
 array form. The category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP
 attribute name.

Constructor Details
NumberUpSupported
public
NumberUpSupported
(int[][] members)
Construct a new number up supported attribute with the given members. The
 supported values for NumberUp are specified in "array form;" see class
SetOfIntegerSyntax
for
 an explanation of array form.
Parameters:
members
- set members in array form
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
members
is
null
or any
         element of
members
is
null
IllegalArgumentException
- if any element of
members
is not
         a length-one or length-two array. Also if
members
is a
         zero-length array or if any member of the set is less than 1.
NumberUpSupported

NumberUpSupported
(int member)
Construct a new number up supported attribute containing a single
 integer. That is, only the one value of
NumberUp
is supported.
Parameters:
member
- set member
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
member < 1
NumberUpSupported

NumberUpSupported
(int lowerBound,
 int upperBound)
Construct a new number up supported attribute containing a single range
 of integers. That is, only those values of
NumberUp
in the one
 range are supported.
Parameters:
lowerBound
- lower bound of the range
upperBound
- upper bound of the range
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if a
null
range is specified or
         if a
non-null
range is specified with
lowerBound
less than 1

object)
Returns whether this number up supported attribute is equivalent to the
 passed in object. To be equivalent, all of the following conditions must
 be true:
object
is not
null
.
object
is an instance of class
NumberUpSupported
.
This number up supported attribute's members and
object
's
   members are the same.
Overrides:
equals

Parameters:
object
-
Object
to compare to
Returns:
true
if
object
is equivalent to this number up
         supported attribute,
false
otherwise
