Class
NumberUp
is an integer valued printing attribute class that
 specifies the number of print-stream pages to impose upon a single side of an
 instance of a selected medium. That is, if the NumberUp value is
n,
the printer must place
n
print-stream pages on a single side of an
 instance of the selected medium. To accomplish this, the printer may add some
 sort of translation, scaling, or rotation. This attribute primarily controls
 the translation, scaling and rotation of print-stream pages.
The effect of a
NumberUp
attribute on a multidoc print job (a job
 with multiple documents) depends on whether all the docs have the same number
 up values specified or whether different docs have different number up values
 specified, and on the (perhaps defaulted) value of the
MultipleDocumentHandling
attribute.
If all the docs have the same number up value
n
specified, then
   any value of
MultipleDocumentHandling
makes sense, and the printer's processing depends on the
MultipleDocumentHandling
value:
SINGLE_DOCUMENT
-- All the input docs will be combined
     together into one output document. Each media impression will consist of
n
m print-stream pages from the output document.
SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET
-- All the input docs will be
     combined together into one output document. Each media impression will
     consist of
n
print-stream pages from the output document. However,
     the first impression of each input doc will always start on a new media
     sheet; this means the last impression of an input doc may have fewer than
n
print-stream pages on it.
SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES
-- The input docs will
     remain separate. Each media impression will consist of
n
print-stream pages from the input doc. Since the input docs are separate,
     the first impression of each input doc will always start on a new media
     sheet; this means the last impression of an input doc may have fewer than
n
print-stream pages on it.
SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES
-- The input docs will
     remain separate. Each media impression will consist of
n
print-stream pages from the input doc. Since the input docs are separate,
     the first impression of each input doc will always start on a new media
     sheet; this means the last impression of an input doc may have fewer than
n
print-stream pages on it.
SINGLE_DOCUMENT
-- All the input docs will be combined
     together into one output document. Each media impression will consist of
n
i
print-stream pages from the output document, where
i
is the number of the input doc corresponding to that point in
     the output document. When the next input doc has a different number up
     value from the previous input doc, the first print-stream page of the
     next input doc goes at the start of the next media impression, possibly
     leaving fewer than the full number of print-stream pages on the previous
     media impression.
SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET
-- All the input docs will be
     combined together into one output document. Each media impression will
     consist of
n
print-stream pages from the output document. However,
     the first impression of each input doc will always start on a new media
     sheet; this means the last impression of an input doc may have fewer than
n
print-stream pages on it.
SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES
-- The input docs will
     remain separate. For input doc
i,
each media impression will
     consist of
n
i
print-stream pages from the input doc.
     Since the input docs are separate, the first impression of each input doc
     will always start on a new media sheet; this means the last impression of
     an input doc may have fewer than
n
i
print-stream pages
     on it.
SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES
-- The input docs will
     remain separate. For input doc
i,
each media impression will
     consist of
n
i
print-stream pages from the input doc.
     Since the input docs are separate, the first impression of each input doc
     will always start on a new media sheet; this means the last impression of
     an input doc may have fewer than
n
i
print-stream pages
     on it.
IPP Compatibility:
The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
 category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
