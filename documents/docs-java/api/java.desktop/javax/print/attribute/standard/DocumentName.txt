DocAttribute
Class
DocumentName
is a printing attribute class, a text attribute,
 that specifies the name of a document.
DocumentName
is an attribute
 of the print data (the doc), not of the Print Job. A document's name is an
 arbitrary string defined by the client. However if a JobName is not
 specified, the
DocumentName
should be used instead, which implies
 that supporting specification of
DocumentName
requires reporting of
 JobName and vice versa. See
JobName
for more information.
IPP Compatibility:
The string value gives the IPP name value. The
 locale gives the IPP natural language. The category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
