public final class
PrinterMessageFromOperator
extends
TextSyntax
implements
PrintServiceAttribute
Class
PrinterMessageFromOperator
is a printing attribute class, a
 text attribute, that provides a message from an operator, system
 administrator, or "intelligent" process to indicate to the end user
 information about or status of the printer, such as why it is unavailable or
 when it is expected to be available.
A Print Service's attribute set includes zero instances or one instance of a
PrinterMessageFromOperator
attribute, not more than one instance. A
 new
PrinterMessageFromOperator
attribute replaces an existing
PrinterMessageFromOperator
attribute, if any. In other words,
PrinterMessageFromOperator
is not intended to be a history log. If it
 wishes, the client can detect changes to a Print Service's
PrinterMessageFromOperator
attribute and maintain the client's own
 history log of the
PrinterMessageFromOperator
attribute values.
IPP Compatibility:
The string value gives the IPP name value. The
 locale gives the IPP natural language. The category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
