PrintRequestAttribute
Class
RequestingUserName
is a printing attribute class, a text
 attribute, that specifies the name of the end user that submitted the print
 job. A requesting user name is an arbitrary string defined by the client. The
 printer does not put the client-specified
RequestingUserName
attribute into the Print Job's attribute set; rather, the printer puts in a
JobOriginatingUserName
attribute. This means
 that services which support specifying a username with this attribute should
 also report a
JobOriginatingUserName
in the job's attribute set. Note
 that many print services may have a way to independently authenticate the
 user name, and so may state support for a requesting user name, but in
 practice will then report the user name authenticated by the service rather
 than that specified via this attribute.
IPP Compatibility:
The string value gives the IPP name value. The
 locale gives the IPP natural language. The category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
