public final class

Class
Destination
is a printing attribute class, a
URI
, that
 is used to indicate an alternate destination for the spooled printer
 formatted data. Many
PrintServices
will not support the notion of a
 destination other than the printer device, and so will not support this
 attribute.
A common use for this attribute will be applications which want to redirect
 output to a local disk file : eg."file:out.prn". Note that proper
 construction of "file:" scheme
URI
instances should be performed
 using the
toURI()
method of class
File
. See the
 documentation on that class for more information.
If a destination
URI
is specified in a PrintRequest and it is not
 accessible for output by the
PrintService
, a
PrintException
will be thrown. The
PrintException
may implement
URIException
to provide a more specific cause.
IPP Compatibility:
Destination is not an IPP attribute.
