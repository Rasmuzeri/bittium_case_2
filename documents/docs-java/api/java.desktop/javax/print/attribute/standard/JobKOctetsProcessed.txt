PrintJobAttribute
Class
JobKOctetsProcessed
is an integer valued printing attribute
 class that specifies the total number of print data octets processed so far
 in K octets, i.e., in units of 1024 octets. The value must be rounded up, so
 that a job between 1 and 1024 octets inclusive must be indicated as being 1K
 octets, 1025 to 2048 inclusive must be 2K, etc. For a multidoc print job (a
 job with multiple documents), the JobKOctetsProcessed value is computed by
 adding up the individual documents' number of octets processed so far, then
 rounding up to the next K octets value.
The
JobKOctetsProcessed
attribute describes the progress of the job.
 This attribute is intended to be a counter. That is, the JobKOctetsProcessed
 value for a job that has not started processing must be 0. When the job's
JobState
is
PROCESSING
or
PROCESSING_STOPPED
, the
JobKOctetsProcessed
value is intended
 to increase as the job is processed; it indicates the amount of the job that
 has been processed at the time the Print Job's attribute set is queried or at
 the time a print job event is reported. When the job enters the
COMPLETED
,
CANCELED
, or
ABORTED
states, the
JobKOctetsProcessed
value is the final value for the job.
For implementations where multiple copies are produced by the interpreter
 with only a single pass over the data, the final value of the
 JobKOctetsProcessed attribute must be equal to the value of the
JobKOctets
attribute. For implementations where multiple
 copies are produced by the interpreter by processing the data for each copy,
 the final value must be a multiple of the value of the
JobKOctets
attribute.
IPP Compatibility:
The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
 category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
