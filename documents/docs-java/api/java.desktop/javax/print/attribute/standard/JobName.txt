Class
JobName
is a printing attribute class, a text attribute, that
 specifies the name of a print job. A job's name is an arbitrary string
 defined by the client. It does not need to be unique between different jobs.
 A Print Job's
JobName
attribute is set to the value supplied by the
 client in the Print Request's attribute set. If, however, the client does not
 supply a
JobName
attribute in the Print Request, the printer, when it
 creates the Print Job, must generate a
JobName
. The printer should
 generate the value of the Print Job's
JobName
attribute from the
 first of the following sources that produces a value: (1) the
DocumentName
attribute of the first (or only) doc in the
 job, (2) the
URL
of the first (or only) doc in the job, if the doc's
 print data representation object is a
URL
, or (3) any other piece of
 Print Job specific and/or document content information.
IPP Compatibility:
The string value gives the IPP name value. The
 locale gives the IPP natural language. The category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
