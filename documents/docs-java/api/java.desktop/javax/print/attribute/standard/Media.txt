Class
Media
is a printing attribute class that specifies the medium
 on which to print.
Media may be specified in different ways.
it may be specified by paper source - eg paper tray
it may be specified by a standard size - eg "A4"
it may be specified by a name - eg "letterhead"
Each of these corresponds to the IPP "media" attribute. The current API does
 not support describing media by characteristics (eg colour, opacity). This
 may be supported in a later revision of the specification.
A
Media
object is constructed with a value which represents one of
 the ways in which the Media attribute can be specified.
IPP Compatibility:
The category name returned by
getName()
is
 the IPP attribute name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum
 value. The
toString()
method returns the IPP string representation of
 the attribute value.
