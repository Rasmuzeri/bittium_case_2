Class
CopiesSupported
is a printing attribute class, a set of
 integers, that gives the supported values for a
Copies
attribute. It is restricted to a single contiguous range of integers;
 multiple non-overlapping ranges are not allowed.
IPP Compatibility:
The CopiesSupported attribute's canonical array
 form gives the lower and upper bound for the range of copies to be included
 in an IPP "copies-supported" attribute. See class
SetOfIntegerSyntax
for an explanation of canonical
 array form. The category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP
 attribute name.

 That is, only the one value of
Copies
is supported.
Parameters:
member
- set member
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
member < 1

 int upperBound)
Construct a new copies supported attribute containing a single range of
 integers. That is, only those values of
Copies
in the one range
 are supported.
Parameters:
lowerBound
- Lower bound of the range
upperBound
- Upper bound of the range
