PrintServiceAttribute
Class
ColorSupported
is a printing attribute class, an enumeration,
 that identifies whether the device is capable of any type of color printing
 at all, including highlight color as well as full process color. All document
 instructions having to do with color are embedded within the print data (none
 are attributes attached to the job outside the print data).
Note: End users are able to determine the nature and details of the color
 support by querying the
PrinterMoreInfoManufacturer
attribute.
Don't confuse the
ColorSupported
attribute with the
Chromaticity
attribute.
Chromaticity
is an attribute the client can specify for
 a job to tell the printer whether to print a document in monochrome or color,
 possibly causing the printer to print a color document in monochrome.
ColorSupported
is a printer description attribute that tells whether
 the printer can print in color regardless of how the client specifies to
 print any particular document.
IPP Compatibility:
The IPP boolean value is "true" for SUPPORTED and
 "false" for NOT_SUPPORTED. The category name returned by
getName()
is
 the IPP attribute name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum
 value. The
toString()
method returns the IPP string representation of
 the attribute value.
