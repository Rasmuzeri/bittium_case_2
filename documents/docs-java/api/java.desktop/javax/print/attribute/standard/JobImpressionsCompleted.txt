PrintJobAttribute
Class
JobImpressionsCompleted
is an integer valued printing attribute
 class that specifies the number of impressions completed for the job so far.
 For printing devices, the impressions completed includes interpreting,
 marking, and stacking the output.
The
JobImpressionsCompleted
attribute describes the progress of the
 job. This attribute is intended to be a counter. That is, the
JobImpressionsCompleted
value for a job that has not started
 processing must be 0. When the job's
JobState
is
PROCESSING
or
PROCESSING_STOPPED
, the
JobImpressionsCompleted
value is intended to increase as the job is
 processed; it indicates the amount of the job that has been processed at the
 time the Print Job's attribute set is queried or at the time a print job
 event is reported. When the job enters the
COMPLETED
,
CANCELED
, or
ABORTED
states, the
JobImpressionsCompleted
value is the final value for the job.
IPP Compatibility:
The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
 category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
