public class

implements
PrintJobAttribute
JobState
is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that
 identifies the current state of a print job. Class
JobState
defines
 standard job state values. A Print Service implementation only needs to
 report those job states which are appropriate for the particular
 implementation; it does not have to report every defined job state. The
JobStateReasons
attribute augments the
JobState
attribute to give more detailed information about the job in
 the given job state.
IPP Compatibility:
The category name returned by
getName()
is
 the IPP attribute name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum
 value. The
toString()
method returns the IPP string representation of
 the attribute value.

Description
static final
JobState
ABORTED

PROCESSING
or

 canceling the job, and all job status attributes have reached their final
 values for the job.
static final
JobState
COMPLETED
The job has completed successfully or with warnings or errors after
 processing, all of the job media sheets have been successfully stacked in
 the appropriate output bin(s), and all job status attributes have reached
 their final values for the job.
static final
JobState
PENDING
The job is a candidate to start processing, but is not yet processing.
static final

PENDING_HELD
The job is not a candidate for processing for any number of reasons but
 will return to the
PENDING
state as soon as the reasons are no
 longer present.
static final
JobState
PROCESSING
The job is processing.
static final
JobState
PROCESSING_STOPPED
The job has stopped while processing for any number of reasons and will

Field Details
UNKNOWN
public static final
JobState
UNKNOWN
The job state is unknown.
PENDING
public static final
JobState
PENDING
The job is a candidate to start processing, but is not yet processing.
PENDING_HELD
public static final
JobState
PENDING_HELD
The job is not a candidate for processing for any number of reasons but
 will return to the
PENDING
state as soon as the reasons are no
 longer present. The job's
JobStateReasons
attribute must indicate why the job is no longer a candidate for
 processing.
PROCESSING
public static final
JobState
PROCESSING
The job is processing. One or more of the following activities is
 occurring:
The job is using, or is attempting to use, one or more purely
   software processes that are analyzing, creating, or interpreting a PDL,
   etc.
The job is using, or is attempting to use, one or more hardware
   devices that are interpreting a PDL, making marks on a medium, and/or
   performing finishing, such as stapling, etc.
The printer has made the job ready for printing, but the output
   device is not yet printing it, either because the job hasn't reached
   the output device or because the job is queued in the output device or
   some other spooler, awaiting the output device to print it.
When the job is in the
PROCESSING
state, the entire job state
 includes the detailed status represented in the printer's
PrinterState
and
PrinterStateReasons
attributes.
Implementations may, though they need not, include additional values in
 the job's
JobStateReasons
attribute to indicate
 the progress of the job, such as adding the
JOB_PRINTING
value to
 indicate when the output device is actually making marks on paper and/or
 the
PROCESSING_TO_STOP_POINT
value to indicate that the printer
 is in the process of canceling or aborting the job.
PROCESSING_STOPPED
public static final
JobState
PROCESSING_STOPPED
The job has stopped while processing for any number of reasons and will
 return to the
PROCESSING
state as soon as the reasons are no
 longer present.
The job's
JobStateReasons
attribute may indicate
 why the job has stopped processing. For example, if the output device is
 stopped, the
PRINTER_STOPPED
value may be included in the job's
JobStateReasons
attribute.
Note:
When an output device is stopped, the device usually
 indicates its condition in human readable form locally at the device. A
 client can obtain more complete device status remotely by querying the
 printer's
PrinterState
and
PrinterStateReasons
attributes.
CANCELED
public static final
JobState
CANCELED
The job has been canceled by some human agency, the printer has completed
 canceling the job, and all job status attributes have reached their final
 values for the job. While the printer is canceling the job, the job
 remains in its current state, but the job's
JobStateReasons
attribute should contain the
PROCESSING_TO_STOP_POINT
value and one of the
CANCELED_BY_USER
,
CANCELED_BY_OPERATOR
, or
CANCELED_AT_DEVICE
values. When the job moves to the
CANCELED
state, the
PROCESSING_TO_STOP_POINT
value, if
 present, must be removed, but the CANCELED_BY_
xxx
value, if
 present, must remain.
ABORTED
public static final
JobState
ABORTED
The job has been aborted by the system (usually while the job was in the
PROCESSING
or
PROCESSING_STOPPED
state), the printer has
 completed aborting the job, and all job status attributes have reached
 their final values for the job. While the printer is aborting the job,
 the job remains in its current state, but the job's
JobStateReasons
attribute should contain the
PROCESSING_TO_STOP_POINT
and
ABORTED_BY_SYSTEM
values.
 When the job moves to the
ABORTED
state, the
PROCESSING_TO_STOP_POINT
value, if present, must be removed, but
 the
ABORTED_BY_SYSTEM
value, if present, must remain.
COMPLETED
public static final
JobState
COMPLETED
The job has completed successfully or with warnings or errors after
 processing, all of the job media sheets have been successfully stacked in
 the appropriate output bin(s), and all job status attributes have reached
 their final values for the job. The job's
JobStateReasons
attribute should contain one of
 these values:
COMPLETED_SUCCESSFULLY
,
COMPLETED_WITH_WARNINGS
, or
COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS
.
