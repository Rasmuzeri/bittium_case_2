public final class
PrinterMoreInfo
extends
URISyntax
implements
PrintServiceAttribute
Class
PrinterMoreInfo
is a printing attribute class, a
URI
,
 that is used to obtain more information about this specific printer. For
 example, this could be an HTTP type
URI
referencing an HTML page
 accessible to a web browser. The information obtained from this
URI
is intended for end user consumption. Features outside the scope of the Print
 Service API can be accessed from this
URI
. The information is
 intended to be specific to this printer instance and site specific services
 (e.g. job pricing, services offered, end user assistance).
In contrast, the
PrinterMoreInfoManufacturer
attribute is
 used to find out more information about this general kind of printer rather
 than this specific printer.
IPP Compatibility:
The string form returned by
toString()
gives the IPP uri value. The category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
