Class
JobPrioritySupported
is an integer valued printing attribute
 class that specifies whether a Print Service instance supports the
JobPriority
attribute and the number of different job
 priority levels supported.
The client can always specify any
JobPriority
value from
 1 to 100 for a job. However, the Print Service instance may support fewer
 than 100 different job priority levels. If this is the case, the Print
 Service instance automatically maps the client-specified job priority value
 to one of the supported job priority levels, dividing the 100 job priority
 values equally among the available job priority levels.
IPP Compatibility:
The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
 category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
