Class
JobPriority
is an integer valued printing attribute class that
 specifies a print job's priority.
If a
JobPriority
attribute is specified for a Print Job, it specifies
 a priority for scheduling the job. A higher value specifies a higher
 priority. The value 1 indicates the lowest possible priority. The value 100
 indicates the highest possible priority. Among those jobs that are ready to
 print, a printer must print all jobs with a priority value of
n
before
 printing those with a priority value of
n
-1 for all
n.
If the client does not specify a
JobPriority
attribute for a Print
 Job and the printer does support the JobPriority attribute, the printer must
 use an implementation-defined default JobPriority value.
The client can always specify any job priority value from 1 to 100 for a job.
 However, a Print Service instance may support fewer than 100 different job
 priority levels. If this is the case, the Print Service instance
 automatically maps the client-specified job priority value to one of the
 supported job priority levels, dividing the 100 job priority values equally
 among the available job priority levels.
IPP Compatibility:
The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
 category name returned by
getName()
gives the IPP attribute name.
