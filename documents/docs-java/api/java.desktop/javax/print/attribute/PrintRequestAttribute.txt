public interface
PrintRequestAttribute
extends
Attribute
Interface
PrintRequestAttribute
is a tagging interface which a
 printing attribute class implements to indicate the attribute denotes a
 requested setting for a print job.
Attributes which are tagged with
PrintRequestAttribute
and are also
 tagged as
PrintJobAttribute
, represent the subset of job attributes
 which can be part of the specification of a job request.
If an attribute implements
DocAttribute
as well as
PrintRequestAttribute
, the client may include the attribute in a
Doc
's attribute set to specify a job setting which pertains just to
 that doc.
