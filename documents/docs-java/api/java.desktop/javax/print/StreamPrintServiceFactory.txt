Class StreamPrintServiceFactory
java.lang.Object
javax.print.StreamPrintServiceFactory
public abstract class
StreamPrintServiceFactory
extends
Object
A
StreamPrintServiceFactory
is the factory for
StreamPrintService
instances, which can print to an output stream in
 a particular document format described as a mime type. A typical output
 document format may be Postscript(TM).
This class is implemented by a service and located by the implementation
 using the
ServiceLoader
facility.
Applications locate instances of this class by calling the
lookupStreamPrintServiceFactories(DocFlavor, String)
method.
Applications can use a
StreamPrintService
obtained from a factory in
 place of a
PrintService
which represents a physical printer device.

Method Details
lookupStreamPrintServiceFactories
public static
StreamPrintServiceFactory
[]
lookupStreamPrintServiceFactories
(
DocFlavor
flavor,
String
outputMimeType)
Locates factories for print services that can be used with a print job to
 output a stream of data in the format specified by
outputMimeType
.
The
outputMimeType
parameter describes the document type that you
 want to create, whereas the
flavor
parameter describes the format
 in which the input data will be provided by the application to the
StreamPrintService
.
Although
null
is an acceptable value to use in the lookup of
 stream printing services, it's typical to search for a particular desired
 format, such as Postscript(TM).
Parameters:
flavor
- of the input document type -
null
means match all
         types
outputMimeType
- representing the required output format, used to
         identify suitable stream printer factories. A value of
null
means match all formats.
Returns:
matching factories for stream print service instance, empty if no
         suitable factories could be located
getOutputFormat
public abstract
String
getOutputFormat
()
Queries the factory for the document format that is emitted by printers
 obtained from this factory.
Returns:
the output format described as a mime type
getSupportedDocFlavors
public abstract
DocFlavor
[]
getSupportedDocFlavors
()
Queries the factory for the document flavors that can be accepted by
 printers obtained from this factory.
Returns:
array of supported doc flavors
getPrintService
public abstract
StreamPrintService
getPrintService
(
OutputStream
out)
Returns a
StreamPrintService
that can print to the specified
 output stream. The output stream is created and managed by the
 application. It is the application's responsibility to close the stream
 and to ensure that this
Printer
is not reused. The application
 should not close this stream until any print job created from the printer
 is complete. Doing so earlier may generate a
PrinterException
and
 an event indicating that the job failed.
Whereas a
PrintService
connected to a physical printer can be
 reused, a
StreamPrintService
connected to a stream cannot. The
 underlying
StreamPrintService
may be disposed by the print system
 with the
dispose
method before
 returning from the
print
method of
DocPrintJob
so that the print system knows this printer is no
 longer usable. This is equivalent to a physical printer going offline -
 permanently. Applications may supply a
null
print stream to
 create a queryable service. It is not valid to create a
PrintJob
for such a stream. Implementations which allocate resources on
 construction should examine the stream and may wish to only allocate
 resources if the stream is
non-null
.
Parameters:
out
- destination stream for generated output
Returns:
a
PrintService
which will generate the format specified
         by the
DocFlavor
supported by this factory
