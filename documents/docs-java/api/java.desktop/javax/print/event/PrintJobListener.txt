Interface PrintJobListener
All Known Implementing Classes:
PrintJobAdapter
public interface
PrintJobListener
Implementations of this listener interface should be attached to a
DocPrintJob
to monitor the status of the
 printer job. These callback methods may be invoked on the thread processing
 the print job, or a service created notification thread. In either case the
 client should not perform lengthy processing in these callbacks.

Description
void
printDataTransferCompleted
(
PrintJobEvent
pje)

 for that data.
void
printJobCanceled

Method Details
printDataTransferCompleted
void
printDataTransferCompleted
(
PrintJobEvent
pje)
Called to notify the client that data has been successfully transferred
 to the print service, and the client may free local resources allocated
 for that data. The client should not assume that the data has been
 completely printed after receiving this event. If this event is not
 received the client should wait for a terminal event
 (completed/canceled/failed) before freeing the resources.
Parameters:
pje
- the job generating this event
printJobCompleted
void
printJobCompleted
(
PrintJobEvent
pje)
Called to notify the client that the job completed successfully.
Parameters:
pje
- the job generating this event
printJobFailed
void
printJobFailed
(
PrintJobEvent
pje)
Called to notify the client that the job failed to complete successfully
 and will have to be resubmitted.
Parameters:
pje
- the job generating this event
printJobCanceled
void
printJobCanceled
(
PrintJobEvent
pje)
Called to notify the client that the job was canceled by a user or a
 program.
Parameters:
pje
- the job generating this event
printJobNoMoreEvents
void
printJobNoMoreEvents
(
PrintJobEvent
pje)
Called to notify the client that no more events will be delivered. One
 cause of this event being generated is if the job has successfully
 completed, but the printing system is limited in capability and cannot
 verify this. This event is required to be delivered if none of the other
 terminal events (completed/failed/canceled) are delivered.
Parameters:
pje
- the job generating this event
printJobRequiresAttention
void
printJobRequiresAttention
(
PrintJobEvent
pje)
Called to notify the client that an error has occurred that the user
 might be able to fix. One example of an error that can generate this
 event is when the printer runs out of paper.
Parameters:
pje
- the job generating this event
