REQUIRES_ATTENTION
public static final
int
REQUIRES_ATTENTION
The print service indicates that a - possibly transient - problem may
 require external intervention before the print service can continue. One
 example of an event that can generate this message is when the printer
 runs out of paper.
See Also:
Constant Field Values
NO_MORE_EVENTS
public static final
int
NO_MORE_EVENTS
Not all print services may be capable of delivering interesting events,
 or even telling when a job is complete. This message indicates the print
 job has no further information or communication with the print service.
 This message should always be delivered if a terminal event
 (completed/failed/canceled) is not delivered. For example, if messages
 such as
JOB_COMPLETE
have NOT been received before receiving this
 message, the only inference that should be drawn is that the print
 service does not support delivering such an event.
See Also:
Constant Field Values
DATA_TRANSFER_COMPLETE
public static final
int
DATA_TRANSFER_COMPLETE
The job is not necessarily printed yet, but the data has been transferred
 successfully from the client to the print service. The client may free
 data resources.
