Class PrintJobAdapter
java.lang.Object
javax.print.event.PrintJobAdapter
All Implemented Interfaces:
PrintJobListener
public abstract class
PrintJobAdapter
extends
Object
implements
PrintJobListener
An abstract adapter class for receiving print job events. The methods in this
 class are empty. This class exists as a convenience for creating listener
 objects. Extend this class to create a
PrintJobEvent
listener and
 override the methods for the events of interest. Unlike the
ComponentListener
interface, this
 abstract interface provides empty methods so that you only need to define the
 methods you need, rather than all of the methods.

Method Details
printDataTransferCompleted
public
void
printDataTransferCompleted
(
PrintJobEvent
pje)
Called to notify the client that data has been successfully transferred
 to the print service, and the client may free local resources allocated
 for that data. The client should not assume that the data has been
 completely printed after receiving this event.
Specified by:
printDataTransferCompleted
in interface
PrintJobListener
Parameters:
pje
- the event being notified
printJobCompleted
public
void
printJobCompleted
(
PrintJobEvent
pje)
Called to notify the client that the job completed successfully.
Specified by:
printJobCompleted
in interface
PrintJobListener
Parameters:
pje
- the event being notified
printJobFailed
public
void
printJobFailed
(
PrintJobEvent
pje)
Called to notify the client that the job failed to complete successfully
 and will have to be resubmitted.
Specified by:
printJobFailed
in interface
PrintJobListener
Parameters:
pje
- the event being notified
printJobCanceled
public
void
printJobCanceled
(
PrintJobEvent
pje)
Called to notify the client that the job was canceled by user or program.
Specified by:
printJobCanceled
in interface
PrintJobListener
Parameters:
pje
- the event being notified
printJobNoMoreEvents
public
void
printJobNoMoreEvents
(
PrintJobEvent
pje)
Called to notify the client that no more events will be delivered. One
 cause of this event being generated is if the job has successfully
 completed, but the printing system is limited in capability and cannot
 verify this. This event is required to be delivered if none of the other
 terminal events (completed/failed/canceled) are delivered.
Specified by:
printJobNoMoreEvents
in interface
PrintJobListener
Parameters:
pje
- the event being notified
printJobRequiresAttention
public
void
printJobRequiresAttention
(
PrintJobEvent
pje)
Called to notify the client that some possibly user rectifiable problem
 occurs (eg printer out of paper).
Specified by:
printJobRequiresAttention
in interface
PrintJobListener
Parameters:
pje
- the event being notified
