Package javax.print.event
package
javax.print.event
Package
javax.print.event
contains event classes and listener
 interfaces.
They may be used to monitor both print services (such as printers going
 on-line & off-line), and the progress of a specific print job.
Please note: In the
javax.print
APIs, a
null
reference
 parameter to methods is incorrect unless explicitly documented on the method
 as having a meaningful interpretation. Usage to the contrary is incorrect
 coding and may result in a run time exception either immediately or at some
 later time.
IllegalArgumentException
and
NullPointerException
are examples of typical and acceptable run time exceptions for such cases.

1.4
