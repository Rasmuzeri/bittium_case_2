Package javax.print
package
javax.print
Provides the principal classes and interfaces for the Java Print
 Service API. The Java Print Service API enables client and server
 applications to:
Discover and select print services based on their capabilities
Specify the format of print data
Submit print jobs to services that support the document type to be
   printed.
Print Service Discovery
An application invokes the static methods of the abstract class
PrintServiceLookup
to locate print
 services that have the capabilities to satisfy the application's print
 request. For example, to print a double-sided document, the application first
 needs to find printers that have the double-sided printing capability.
The JDK includes
PrintServiceLookup
implementations that can locate
 the standard platform printers. To locate other types of printers, such as
 IPP printers or JINI printers, a print-service provider can write
 implementations of
PrintServiceLookup
. The print-service provider can
 dynamically install these
PrintServiceLookup
implementations using
 the
ServiceLoader
facility.
Attribute Definitions
The
javax.print.attribute
and
javax.print.attribute.standard
packages define print attributes, which describe the capabilities of a print
 service, specify the requirements of a print job, and track the progress of a
 print job.
The
javax.print.attribute
package describes the types of attributes
 and how they can be collected into sets. The
javax.print.attribute.standard
package enumerates all of the standard
 attributes supported by the API, most of which are implementations of
 attributes specified in the IETF Specification,
RFC 2911 Internet Printing
 Protocol, 1.1: Model and Semantics
, dated September 2000. The attributes
 specified in
javax.print.attribute.standard
include common
 capabilities, such as: resolution, copies, media sizes, job priority, and
 page ranges.
Document Type Specification
The
DocFlavor
class represents the print data
 format, such as JPEG or PostScript. A
DocFlavor
object consists of a
 MIME type, which describes the format, and a document representation class
 name that indicates how the document is delivered to the printer or output
 stream. An application uses the
DocFlavor
and an attribute set to
 find printers that can print the document type specified by the
DocFlavor
and have the capabilities specified by the attribute set.
Using the API
A typical application using the Java Print Service API performs these steps
 to process a print request:
Chooses a
DocFlavor
.
Creates a set of attributes.
Locates a print service that can handle the print request as specified
   by the
DocFlavor
and the attribute set.
Creates a
Doc
object encapsulating the
DocFlavor
and the actual print data, which can take many forms
   including: a Postscript file, a JPEG image, a
URL
, or plain text.
Gets a print job, represented by
DocPrintJob
, from the print service.
Calls the print method of the print job.
The following code sample demonstrates a typical use of the Java Print
 Service API: locating printers that can print five double-sided copies of a
 Postscript document on size A4 paper, creating a print job from one of the
 returned print services, and calling print.
FileInputStream psStream;
 try {
     psStream = new FileInputStream("file.ps");
 } catch (FileNotFoundException ffne) {
 }
 if (psStream == null) {
     return;
 }
 DocFlavor psInFormat = DocFlavor.INPUT_STREAM.POSTSCRIPT;
 Doc myDoc = new SimpleDoc(psStream, psInFormat, null);
 PrintRequestAttributeSet aset = new HashPrintRequestAttributeSet();
 aset.add(new Copies(5));
 aset.add(MediaSizeName.ISO_A4);
 aset.add(Sides.DUPLEX);
 PrintService[] services =
 PrintServiceLookup.lookupPrintServices(psInFormat, aset);
 if (services.length > 0) {
     DocPrintJob job = services[0].createPrintJob();
     try {
         job.print(myDoc, aset);
     } catch (PrintException pe) {}
 }
Please note: In the
javax.print
APIs, a
null
reference
 parameter to methods is incorrect unless explicitly documented on the method
 as having a meaningful interpretation. Usage to the contrary is incorrect
 coding and may result in a run time exception either immediately or at some
 later time.
IllegalArgumentException
and
NullPointerException
are examples of typical and acceptable run time exceptions for such cases.
