public interface
PrintService
Interface
PrintService
is the factory for a
DocPrintJob
. A
PrintService
describes the capabilities of a printer and can be
 queried regarding a printer's supported attributes.
Example:
DocFlavor flavor = DocFlavor.INPUT_STREAM.POSTSCRIPT;
   PrintRequestAttributeSet aset = new HashPrintRequestAttributeSet();
   aset.add(MediaSizeName.ISO_A4);
   PrintService[] pservices =
                 PrintServiceLookup.lookupPrintServices(flavor, aset);
   if (pservices.length > 0) {
       DocPrintJob pj = pservices[0].createPrintJob();
       try {
           FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("test.ps");
           Doc doc = new SimpleDoc(fis, flavor, null);
           pj.print(doc, aset);
        } catch (FileNotFoundException fe) {
        } catch (PrintException e) {
        }
   }

getAttributes
PrintServiceAttributeSet
getAttributes
()
Obtains this print service's set of printer description attributes giving
 this Print Service's status. The returned attribute set object is
 unmodifiable. The returned attribute set object is a "snapshot" of this
 Print Service's attribute set at the time of the
getAttributes()
method call: that is, the returned attribute set's contents will
not
be updated if this print service's attribute set's contents
 change in the future. To detect changes in attribute values, call
getAttributes()
again and compare the new attribute set to the
 previous attribute set; alternatively, register a listener for print
 service events.
Returns:
unmodifiable snapshot of this Print Service's attribute set. May
         be empty, but not
null
.
getAttribute
<T extends

>
T
getAttribute
(
Class
<T> category)
Gets the value of the single specified service attribute. This may be
 useful to clients which only need the value of one attribute and want to
 minimize overhead.
Type Parameters:
T
- the type of the specified service attribute
Parameters:
category
- the category of a
PrintServiceAttribute
supported by this service - may not be
null
Returns:
the value of the supported attribute or
null
if the
         attribute is not supported by this service
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if the category is
null
IllegalArgumentException
- if
category
is not a
Class
that implements interface
PrintServiceAttribute
getSupportedDocFlavors
DocFlavor
[]
getSupportedDocFlavors
()
Determines the print data formats a client can specify when setting up a
 job for this
PrintService
. A print data format is designated by a
 "doc flavor" (class
DocFlavor
) consisting of a MIME
 type plus a print data representation class.
Note that some doc flavors may not be supported in combination with all
 attributes. Use
getUnsupportedAttributes(..)
to validate specific
 combinations.
Returns:
array of supported doc flavors, should have at least one element
isDocFlavorSupported
boolean
isDocFlavorSupported
(
DocFlavor
flavor)
Determines if this print service supports a specific
DocFlavor
.
 This is a convenience method to determine if the
DocFlavor
would
 be a member of the result of
getSupportedDocFlavors()
.
Note that some doc flavors may not be supported in combination with all
 attributes. Use
getUnsupportedAttributes(..)
to validate specific
 combinations.
Parameters:
flavor
- the
DocFlavor
to query for support
Returns:
true
if this print service supports the specified
DocFlavor
;
false
otherwise
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
flavor
is
null
getSupportedAttributeCategories
Class
<?>[]
getSupportedAttributeCategories
()
Determines the printing attribute categories a client can specify when
 setting up a job for this print service. A printing attribute category is
 designated by a
Class
that implements interface
Attribute
. This method returns just the attribute
categories
that are supported; it does not return the particular
 attribute
values
that are supported.
This method returns all the printing attribute categories this print
 service supports for any possible job. Some categories may not be
 supported in a particular context (ie for a particular
DocFlavor
). Use one of the methods that include a
DocFlavor
to validate the request before submitting it, such as
getSupportedAttributeValues(..)
.
Returns:
array of printing attribute categories that the client can
         specify as a doc-level or job-level attribute in a Print Request.
         Each element in the array is a
Class
that
         implements interface
Attribute
. The array is
         empty if no categories are supported.
isAttributeCategorySupported
boolean
isAttributeCategorySupported
(
Class
<? extends
Attribute
> category)
Determines whether a client can specify the given printing attribute
 category when setting up a job for this print service. A printing
 attribute category is designated by a
Class
that implements
 interface
Attribute
. This method
 tells whether the attribute
category
is supported; it does not
 tell whether a particular attribute
value
is supported.
Some categories may not be supported in a particular context (ie for a
 particular
DocFlavor
). Use one of the methods which include a
DocFlavor
to validate the request before submitting it, such as
getSupportedAttributeValues(..)
.
This is a convenience method to determine if the category would be a
 member of the result of
getSupportedAttributeCategories()
.
Parameters:
category
- printing attribute category to test. It must be a
Class
that implements interface
Attribute
.
Returns:
true
if this print service supports specifying a
         doc-level or job-level attribute in
category
in a Print
         Request;
false
if it doesn't
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
category
is
null
IllegalArgumentException
- if
category
is not a
Class
that implements interface
Attribute
getDefaultAttributeValue
Object
getDefaultAttributeValue
(
Class
<? extends
Attribute
> category)
Determines this print service's default printing attribute value in the
 given category. A printing attribute value is an instance of a class that
 implements interface
Attribute
. If a client sets up a
 print job and does not specify any attribute value in the given category,
 this Print Service will use the default attribute value instead.
Some attributes may not be supported in a particular context (ie for a
 particular
DocFlavor
). Use one of the methods that include a
DocFlavor
to validate the request before submitting it, such as
getSupportedAttributeValues(..)
.
Not all attributes have a default value. For example the service will not
 have a default value for
RequestingUser
i.e. a
null
return for a supported category means there is no service default value
 for that category. Use the
isAttributeCategorySupported(Class)
method to distinguish these cases.
Parameters:
category
- printing attribute category for which the default
         attribute value is requested. It must be a
Class
that implements interface
Attribute
.
Returns:
default attribute value for
category
, or
null
if
         this Print Service does not support specifying a doc-level or
         job-level attribute in
category
in a Print Request, or
         the service does not have a default value for this attribute
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
category
is
null
IllegalArgumentException
- if
category
is not a
Class
that implements interface
Attribute
getSupportedAttributeValues
Object
getSupportedAttributeValues
(
Class
<? extends
Attribute
> category,
DocFlavor
flavor,
AttributeSet
attributes)
Determines the printing attribute values a client can specify in the
 given category when setting up a job for this print service. A printing
 attribute value is an instance of a class that implements interface
Attribute
.
If
flavor
is
null
and
attributes
is
null
or is an empty set, this method returns all the printing attribute values
 this Print Service supports for any possible job. If
flavor
is not
null
or
attributes
is not an empty set, this method
 returns just the printing attribute values that are compatible with the
 given doc flavor and/or set of attributes. That is, a
null
return
 value may indicate that specifying this attribute is incompatible with
 the specified DocFlavor. Also if
DocFlavor
is not
null
it
 must be a flavor supported by this
PrintService
, else
IllegalArgumentException
will be thrown.
If the
attributes
parameter contains an
Attribute
whose
 category is the same as the
category
parameter, the service must
 ignore this attribute in the
AttributeSet
.
DocAttribute
s which are to be specified on the
Doc
must
 be included in this set to accurately represent the context.
This method returns an
Object
because different printing
 attribute categories indicate the supported attribute values in different
 ways. The documentation for each printing attribute in package
javax.print.attribute.standard
describes how each attribute indicates its supported values. Possible
 ways of indicating support include:
Return a single instance of the attribute category to indicate that
   any value is legal -- used, for example, by an attribute whose value is
   an arbitrary text string. (The value of the returned attribute object
   is irrelevant.)
Return an array of one or more instances of the attribute category,
   containing the legal values -- used, for example, by an attribute with
   a list of enumerated values. The type of the array is an array of the
   specified attribute category type as returned by its
getCategory(Class)
.
Return a single object (of some class other than the attribute
   category) that indicates bounds on the legal values -- used, for
   example, by an integer-valued attribute that must lie within a certain
   range.
Parameters:
category
- printing attribute category to test. It must be a
Class
that implements interface
Attribute
.
flavor
- doc flavor for a supposed job, or
null
attributes
- set of printing attributes for a supposed job (both
         job-level attributes and document-level attributes), or
null
Returns:
object indicating supported values for
category
, or
null
if this Print Service does not support specifying a
         doc-level or job-level attribute in
category
in a Print
         Request
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
category
is
null
IllegalArgumentException
- if
category
is not a
Class
that implements interface
Attribute
, or
DocFlavor
is not
         supported by this service
isAttributeValueSupported
boolean
isAttributeValueSupported
(
Attribute
attrval,
DocFlavor
flavor,
AttributeSet
attributes)
Determines whether a client can specify the given printing attribute
 value when setting up a job for this Print Service. A printing attribute
 value is an instance of a class that implements interface
Attribute
.
If
flavor
is
null
and
attributes
is
null
or is an empty set, this method tells whether this Print Service supports
 the given printing attribute value for some possible combination of doc
 flavor and set of attributes. If
flavor
is not
null
or
attributes
is not an empty set, this method tells whether this
 Print Service supports the given printing attribute value in combination
 with the given doc flavor and/or set of attributes.
Also if
DocFlavor
is not
null
it must be a flavor
 supported by this
PrintService
, else
IllegalArgumentException
will be thrown.
DocAttribute
s which are to be specified on the
Doc
must
 be included in this set to accurately represent the context.
This is a convenience method to determine if the value would be a member
 of the result of
getSupportedAttributeValues(...)
.
Parameters:
attrval
- printing attribute value to test
flavor
- doc flavor for a supposed job, or
null
attributes
- set of printing attributes for a supposed job (both
         job-level attributes and document-level attributes), or
null
Returns:
true
if this Print Service supports specifying
attrval
as a doc-level or job-level attribute in a Print
         Request,
false
if it doesn't
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
attrval
is
null
IllegalArgumentException
- if flavor is not supported by this
PrintService
getUnsupportedAttributes
AttributeSet
getUnsupportedAttributes
(
DocFlavor
flavor,
AttributeSet
attributes)
Identifies the attributes that are unsupported for a print request in the
 context of a particular
DocFlavor
. This method is useful for
 validating a potential print job and identifying the specific attributes
 which cannot be supported. It is important to supply only a supported
DocFlavor
or an
IllegalArgumentException
will be thrown.
 If the return value from this method is
null
, all attributes are
 supported.
DocAttribute
s which are to be specified on the
Doc
must
 be included in this set to accurately represent the context.
If the return value is
non-null
, all attributes in the returned
 set are unsupported with this
DocFlavor
. The returned set does
 not distinguish attribute categories that are unsupported from
 unsupported attribute values.
A supported print request can then be created by removing all unsupported
 attributes from the original attribute set, except in the case that the
DocFlavor
is unsupported.
If any attributes are unsupported only because they are in conflict with
 other attributes then it is at the discretion of the service to select
 the attribute(s) to be identified as the cause of the conflict.
Use
isDocFlavorSupported()
to verify that a
DocFlavor
is
 supported before calling this method.
Parameters:
flavor
- doc flavor to test, or
null
attributes
- set of printing attributes for a supposed job (both
         job-level attributes and document-level attributes), or
null
Returns:
null
if this Print Service supports the print request
         specification, else the unsupported attributes
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
flavor
is not supported by
         this
PrintService
getServiceUIFactory
ServiceUIFactory
getServiceUIFactory
()
Returns a factory for UI components which allow users to interact with
 the service in various roles. Services which do not provide any UI should
 return
null
. Print Services which do provide UI but want to be
 supported in an environment with no UI support should ensure that the
 factory is not initialised unless the application calls this method to
 obtain the factory. See
ServiceUIFactory
for more information.
Returns:
null
or a factory for UI components
equals
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Determines if two services are referring to the same underlying service.
 Objects encapsulating a print service may not exhibit equality of
 reference even though they refer to the same underlying service.
Clients should call this method to determine if two services are
 referring to the same underlying service.
Services must implement this method and return
true
only if the
 service objects being compared may be used interchangeably by the client.
 Services are free to return the same object reference to an underlying
 service if that, but clients must not depend on equality of reference.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- the reference object with which to compare
Returns:
true
if this service is the same as the obj argument,
false
otherwise
See Also:
Object.hashCode()
HashMap
hashCode
int
hashCode
()
This method should be implemented consistently with
equals(Object)
.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
hash code of this object
See Also:
Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)
