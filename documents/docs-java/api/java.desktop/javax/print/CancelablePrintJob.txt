Interface CancelablePrintJob
All Superinterfaces:
DocPrintJob
public interface
CancelablePrintJob
extends
DocPrintJob
This interface is used by a printing application to cancel a print job. This
 interface extends
DocPrintJob
. A
DocPrintJob
implementation
 returned from a print service implements this interface if the print job can
 be cancelled. Before trying to cancel a print job, the client needs to test
 if the
DocPrintJob
object returned from the print service actually
 implements this interface. Clients should never assume that a
DocPrintJob
implements this interface. A print service might support
 cancellation only for certain types of print data and representation class
 names. This means that only some of the
DocPrintJob
objects returned
 from a service will implement this interface.
Service implementors are encouraged to implement this optional interface and
 to deliver a
PrintJobEvent.JOB_CANCELED
event to
 any listeners if a job is successfully cancelled with an implementation of
 this interface. Services should also note that an implementation of this
 method may be made from a separate client thread than that which made the
 print request. Thus the implementation of this interface must be made thread
 safe.

Method Details
cancel
void
cancel
()
     throws
PrintException
Stops further processing of a print job.
If a service supports this method it cannot be concluded that job
 cancellation will always succeed. A job may not be able to be cancelled
 once it has reached and passed some point in its processing. A successful
 cancellation means only that the entire job was not printed, some portion
 may already have printed when cancel returns.
The service will throw a
PrintException
if the cancellation did
 not succeed. A job which has not yet been submitted for printing should
 throw this exception. Cancelling an already successfully cancelled Print
 Job is not considered an error and will always succeed.
Cancellation in some services may be a lengthy process, involving
 requests to a server and processing of its print queue. Clients may wish
 to execute cancel in a thread which does not affect application
 execution.
Throws:
PrintException
- if the job could not be successfully cancelled
