Class SimpleDoc
java.lang.Object
javax.print.SimpleDoc
All Implemented Interfaces:
Doc
public final class
SimpleDoc
extends
Object
implements
Doc
This class is an implementation of interface
Doc
that can be used in
 many common printing requests. It can handle all of the presently defined
 "pre-defined" doc flavors defined as static variables in the
DocFlavor
class.
In particular this class implements certain required semantics of the
Doc
specification as follows:
constructs a stream for the service if requested and appropriate.
ensures the same object is returned for each call on a method.
ensures multiple threads can access the
Doc
performs some validation of that the data matches the doc flavor.
Clients who want to re-use the doc object in other jobs, or need a
MultiDoc
will not want to use this class.
If the print data is a stream, or a print job requests data as a stream, then
SimpleDoc
does not monitor if the service properly closes the stream
 after data transfer completion or job termination. Clients may prefer to use
 provide their own implementation of doc that adds a listener to monitor job
 completion and to validate that resources such as streams are freed (ie
 closed).

Constructor Details
SimpleDoc
public
SimpleDoc
(
Object
printData,
DocFlavor
flavor,
DocAttributeSet
attributes)
Constructs a
SimpleDoc
with the specified print data, doc flavor
 and doc attribute set.
Parameters:
printData
- the print data object
flavor
- the
DocFlavor
object
attributes
- a
DocAttributeSet
, which can be
null
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
flavor
or
printData
is
null
, or the
printData
does not correspond to
         the specified doc flavor--for example, the data is not of the
         type specified as the representation in the
DocFlavor
Method Details
getDocFlavor
public
DocFlavor
getDocFlavor
()
Determines the doc flavor in which this doc object will supply its piece
 of print data.
Specified by:
getDocFlavor
in interface
Doc
Returns:
doc flavor
getAttributes
public
DocAttributeSet
getAttributes
()
Obtains the set of printing attributes for this doc object. If the
 returned attribute set includes an instance of a particular attribute
X,
the printer must use that attribute value for this doc,
 overriding any value of attribute
X
in the job's attribute set. If
 the returned attribute set does not include an instance of a particular
 attribute
X
or if
null
is returned, the printer must
 consult the job's attribute set to obtain the value for attribute
X,
and if not found there, the printer must use an
 implementation-dependent default value. The returned attribute set is
 unmodifiable.
Specified by:
getAttributes
in interface
Doc
Returns:
unmodifiable set of printing attributes for this doc, or
null
to obtain all attribute values from the job's
         attribute set
getPrintData
public
Object
getPrintData
()
                    throws
IOException
Obtains the print data representation object that contains this doc
 object's piece of print data in the format corresponding to the supported
 doc flavor. The
getPrintData()
method returns an instance of the
 representation class whose name is given by
getDocFlavor()
.
getRepresentationClassName()
, and the return value can be cast from
 class
Object
to that representation class.
Specified by:
getPrintData
in interface
Doc
Returns:
print data representation object
Throws:
IOException
- if the representation class is a stream and there was
         an I/O error while constructing the stream
getReaderForText
public
Reader
getReaderForText
()
                        throws
IOException
Obtains a reader for extracting character print data from this doc. The
Doc
implementation is required to support this method if the
DocFlavor
has one of the following print data representation
 classes, and return
null
otherwise:
char[]
java.lang.String
java.io.Reader
The doc's print data representation object is used to construct and
 return a
Reader
for reading the print data as a stream of
 characters from the print data representation object. However, if the
 print data representation object is itself a
Reader
then the
 print data representation object is simply returned.
Specified by:
getReaderForText
in interface
Doc
Returns:
a
Reader
for reading the print data characters from this
         doc. If a reader cannot be provided because this doc does not
         meet the criteria stated above,
null
is returned.
Throws:
IOException
- if there was an I/O error while creating the reader
getStreamForBytes
public
InputStream
getStreamForBytes
()
                              throws
IOException
Obtains an input stream for extracting byte print data from this doc. The
Doc
implementation is required to support this method if the
DocFlavor
has one of the following print data representation
 classes; otherwise this method returns
null
:
byte[]
java.io.InputStream
The doc's print data representation object is obtained. Then, an input
 stream for reading the print data from the print data representation
 object as a stream of bytes is created and returned. However, if the
 print data representation object is itself an input stream then the print
 data representation object is simply returned.
Specified by:
getStreamForBytes
in interface
Doc
Returns:
an
InputStream
for reading the print data bytes from this
         doc. If an input stream cannot be provided because this doc does
         not meet the criteria stated above,
null
is returned.
Throws:
IOException
- if there was an I/O error while creating the input
         stream
