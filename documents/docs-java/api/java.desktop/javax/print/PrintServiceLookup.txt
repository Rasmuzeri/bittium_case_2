Class PrintServiceLookup
java.lang.Object
javax.print.PrintServiceLookup
public abstract class
PrintServiceLookup
extends
Object
Implementations of this class provide lookup services for print services
 (typically equivalent to printers) of a particular type.
Multiple implementations may be installed concurrently. All implementations
 must be able to describe the located printers as instances of a
PrintService
. Typically implementations of this service class are
 located automatically in JAR files (see the SPI JAR file specification).
 These classes must be instantiable using a default constructor. Alternatively
 applications may explicitly register instances at runtime.
Applications use only the static methods of this abstract class. The instance
 methods are implemented by a service provider in a subclass and the
 unification of the results from all installed lookup classes are reported by
 the static methods of this class when called by the application.
A
PrintServiceLookup
implementor is recommended to check for the
SecurityManager.checkPrintJobAccess()
to deny access to untrusted
 code. Following this recommended policy means that untrusted code may not be
 able to locate any print services. Downloaded applets are the most common
 example of untrusted code.
This check is made on a per lookup service basis to allow flexibility in the
 policy to reflect the needs of different lookup services.
Services which are registered by
registerService(PrintService)
will
 not be included in lookup results if a security manager is installed and its
checkPrintJobAccess()
method denies access.

Method Details
lookupPrintServices
public static final
PrintService
[]
lookupPrintServices
(
DocFlavor
flavor,
AttributeSet
attributes)
Locates print services capable of printing the specified
DocFlavor
.
Parameters:
flavor
- the flavor to print. If
null
, this constraint is
         not used.
attributes
- attributes that the print service must support. If
null
this constraint is not used.
Returns:
array of matching
PrintService
objects representing print
         services that support the specified flavor attributes. If no
         services match, the array is zero-length.
lookupMultiDocPrintServices
public static final
MultiDocPrintService
[]
lookupMultiDocPrintServices
(
DocFlavor
[] flavors,
AttributeSet
attributes)
Locates
MultiDoc
print
Services
capable of printing
MultiDocs
containing all the specified doc flavors.
This method is useful to help locate a service that can print a
MultiDoc
in which the elements may be different flavors. An
 application could perform this itself by multiple lookups on each
DocFlavor
in turn and collating the results, but the lookup
 service may be able to do this more efficiently.
Parameters:
flavors
- the flavors to print. If
null
or empty this
         constraint is not used. Otherwise return only multidoc print
         services that can print all specified doc flavors.
attributes
- attributes that the print service must support. If
null
this constraint is not used.
Returns:
array of matching
MultiDocPrintService
objects. If no
         services match, the array is zero-length.
lookupDefaultPrintService
public static final
PrintService
lookupDefaultPrintService
()
Locates the default print service for this environment. This may return
null
. If multiple lookup services each specify a default, the
 chosen service is not precisely defined, but a platform native service,
 rather than an installed service, is usually returned as the default. If
 there is no clearly identifiable platform native default print service,
 the default is the first to be located in an implementation-dependent
 manner.
This may include making use of any preferences API that is available as
 part of the Java or native platform. This algorithm may be overridden by
 a user setting the property
javax.print.defaultPrinter
. A service
 specified must be discovered to be valid and currently available to be
 returned as the default.
Returns:
the default
PrintService
registerServiceProvider
public static
boolean
registerServiceProvider
(
PrintServiceLookup
sp)
Allows an application to explicitly register a class that implements
 lookup services. The registration will not persist across VM invocations.
 This is useful if an application needs to make a new service available
 that is not part of the installation. If the lookup service is already
 registered, or cannot be registered, the method returns
false
.
Parameters:
sp
- an implementation of a lookup service
Returns:
true
if the new lookup service is newly registered;
false
otherwise
registerService
public static
boolean
registerService
(
PrintService
service)
Allows an application to directly register an instance of a class which
 implements a print service. The lookup operations for this service will
 be performed by the
PrintServiceLookup
class using the attribute
 values and classes reported by the service. This may be less efficient
 than a lookup service tuned for that service. Therefore registering a
PrintServiceLookup
instance instead is recommended. The method
 returns
true
if this service is not previously registered and is
 now successfully registered. This method should not be called with
StreamPrintService
instances. They will always fail to register
 and the method will return
false
.
Parameters:
service
- an implementation of a print service
Returns:
true
if the service is newly registered;
false
otherwise
getPrintServices
public abstract
PrintService
[]
getPrintServices
(
DocFlavor
flavor,
AttributeSet
attributes)
Locates services that can be positively confirmed to support the
 combination of attributes and
DocFlavors
specified. This method
 is not called directly by applications.
Implemented by a service provider, used by the static methods of this
 class.
The results should be the same as obtaining all the
PrintServices
and querying each one individually on its support for the specified
 attributes and flavors, but the process can be more efficient by taking
 advantage of the capabilities of lookup services for the print services.
Parameters:
flavor
- of document required. If
null
it is ignored.
attributes
- required to be supported. If
null
this
         constraint is not used.
Returns:
array of matching
PrintServices
. If no services match,
         the array is zero-length.
getPrintServices
public abstract
PrintService
[]
getPrintServices
()
Not called directly by applications. Implemented by a service provider,
 used by the static methods of this class.
Returns:
array of all
PrintServices
known to this lookup service
         class. If none are found, the array is zero-length.
getMultiDocPrintServices
public abstract
MultiDocPrintService
[]
getMultiDocPrintServices
(
DocFlavor
[] flavors,
AttributeSet
attributes)
Not called directly by applications.
Implemented by a service provider, used by the static methods of this
 class.
Locates
MultiDoc
print services which can be positively confirmed
 to support the combination of attributes and
DocFlavors
specified.
Parameters:
flavors
- of documents required. If
null
or empty it is
         ignored.
attributes
- required to be supported. If
null
this
         constraint is not used.
Returns:
array of matching
PrintServices
. If no services match,
         the array is zero-length.
getDefaultPrintService
public abstract
PrintService
getDefaultPrintService
()
Not called directly by applications. Implemented by a service provider,
 and called by the print lookup service.
Returns:
the default
PrintService
for this lookup service. If
         there is no default, returns
null
