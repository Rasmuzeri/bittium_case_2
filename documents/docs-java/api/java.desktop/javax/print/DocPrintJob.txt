Interface DocPrintJob
All Known Subinterfaces:
CancelablePrintJob
,
MultiDocPrintJob
public interface
DocPrintJob
This interface represents a print job that can print a specified document
 with a set of job attributes. An object implementing this interface is
 obtained from a print service.

Method
Description
void
addPrintJobAttributeListener
(
PrintJobAttributeListener
listener,
PrintJobAttributeSet
attributes)
Registers a listener for changes in the specified attributes.
void
addPrintJobListener
(
PrintJobListener
listener)
Registers a listener for event occurring during this print job.
PrintJobAttributeSet
getAttributes
()
Obtains this Print Job's set of printing attributes.
PrintService
getPrintService
()
Determines the
PrintService
object to which this print job object
 is bound.
void
print
(
Doc
doc,
PrintRequestAttributeSet
attributes)
Prints a document with the specified job attributes.
void
removePrintJobAttributeListener
(
PrintJobAttributeListener
listener)
Removes an attribute listener from this print job.
void
removePrintJobListener
(
PrintJobListener
listener)
Removes a listener from this print job.
Method Details
getPrintService
PrintService
getPrintService
()
Determines the
PrintService
object to which this print job object
 is bound.
Returns:
PrintService
object
getAttributes
PrintJobAttributeSet
getAttributes
()
Obtains this Print Job's set of printing attributes. The returned
 attribute set object is unmodifiable. The returned attribute set object
 is a "snapshot" of this Print Job's attribute set at the time of the
getAttributes()
method call; that is, the returned attribute
 set's object's contents will not be updated if this Print Job's attribute
 set's contents change in the future. To detect changes in attribute
 values, call
getAttributes()
again and compare the new attribute
 set to the previous attribute set; alternatively, register a listener for
 print job events. The returned value may be an empty set but should not
 be
null
.
Returns:
the print job attributes
addPrintJobListener
void
addPrintJobListener
(
PrintJobListener
listener)
Registers a listener for event occurring during this print job. If
 listener is
null
, no exception is thrown and no action is
 performed. If listener is already registered, it will be registered
 again.
Parameters:
listener
- the object implementing the listener interface
See Also:
removePrintJobListener(javax.print.event.PrintJobListener)
removePrintJobListener
void
removePrintJobListener
(
PrintJobListener
listener)
Removes a listener from this print job. This method performs no function,
 nor does it throw an exception, if the listener specified by the argument
 was not previously added to this print job. If listener is
null
,
 no exception is thrown and no action is performed. If a listener was
 registered more than once only one of the registrations will be removed.
Parameters:
listener
- the object implementing the listener interface
See Also:
addPrintJobListener(javax.print.event.PrintJobListener)
addPrintJobAttributeListener
void
addPrintJobAttributeListener
(
PrintJobAttributeListener
listener,
PrintJobAttributeSet
attributes)
Registers a listener for changes in the specified attributes. If listener
 is
null
, no exception is thrown and no action is performed. To
 determine the attribute updates that may be reported by this job, a
 client can call
getAttributes()
and identify the subset that are
 interesting and likely to be reported to the listener. Clients expecting
 to be updated about changes in a specific job attribute should verify it
 is in that set, but updates about an attribute will be made only if it
 changes and this is detected by the job. Also updates may be subject to
 batching by the job. To minimize overhead in print job processing it is
 recommended to listen on only that subset of attributes which are likely
 to change. If the specified set is empty no attribute updates will be
 reported to the listener. If the attribute set is
null
, then this
 means to listen on all dynamic attributes that the job supports. This may
 result in no update notifications if a job can not report any attribute
 updates.
If listener is already registered, it will be registered again.
Parameters:
listener
- the object implementing the listener interface
attributes
- the attributes to listen on, or
null
to mean
         all attributes that can change, as determined by the job
See Also:
removePrintJobAttributeListener(javax.print.event.PrintJobAttributeListener)
removePrintJobAttributeListener
void
removePrintJobAttributeListener
(
PrintJobAttributeListener
listener)
Removes an attribute listener from this print job. This method performs
 no function, nor does it throw an exception, if the listener specified by
 the argument was not previously added to this print job. If the listener
 is
null
, no exception is thrown and no action is performed. If a
 listener is registered more than once, even for a different set of
 attributes, no guarantee is made which listener is removed.
Parameters:
listener
- the object implementing the listener interface
See Also:
addPrintJobAttributeListener(javax.print.event.PrintJobAttributeListener, javax.print.attribute.PrintJobAttributeSet)
print
void
print
(
Doc
doc,
PrintRequestAttributeSet
attributes)
throws
PrintException
Prints a document with the specified job attributes. This method should
 only be called once for a given print job. Calling it again will not
 result in a new job being spooled to the printer. The service
 implementation will define policy for service interruption and recovery.
 When the print method returns, printing may not yet have completed as
 printing may happen asynchronously, perhaps in a different thread.
 Application clients which want to monitor the success or failure should
 register a
PrintJobListener
.
Print service implementors should close any print data streams (ie
Reader
or
InputStream
implementations) that they obtain
 from the client doc. Robust clients may still wish to verify this. An
 exception is always generated if a
DocFlavor
cannot be printed.
Parameters:
doc
- the document to be printed. It must be a flavor supported by
         this PrintJob.
attributes
- the job attributes to be applied to this print job. If
         this parameter is
null
then the default attributes are
         used.
Throws:
PrintException
- the exception additionally may implement an
         interface that more precisely describes the cause of the
         exception
FlavorException
. If the document has a flavor not
           supported by this print job.
AttributeException
. If one or more of the
           attributes are not valid for this print job.
