Interface IIOWriteWarningListener
All Superinterfaces:
EventListener
public interface
IIOWriteWarningListener
extends
EventListener
An interface used by
ImageWriter
implementations to
 notify callers of their image and thumbnail reading methods of
 warnings (non-fatal errors).  Fatal errors cause the relevant
 read method to throw an
IIOException
.
Localization is handled by associating a
Locale
with each
IIOWriteWarningListener
as it is registered
 with an
ImageWriter
.  It is up to the
ImageWriter
to provide localized messages.
