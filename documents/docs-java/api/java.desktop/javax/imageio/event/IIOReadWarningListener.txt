Interface IIOReadWarningListener
All Superinterfaces:
EventListener
public interface
IIOReadWarningListener
extends
EventListener
An interface used by
ImageReader
implementations to
 notify callers of their image and thumbnail reading methods of
 warnings (non-fatal errors).  Fatal errors cause the relevant
 read method to throw an
IIOException
.
Localization is handled by associating a
Locale
with each
IIOReadWarningListener
as it is registered
 with an
ImageReader
.  It is up to the
ImageReader
to provide localized messages.
