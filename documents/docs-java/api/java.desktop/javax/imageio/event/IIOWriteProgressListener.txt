Interface IIOWriteProgressListener
All Superinterfaces:
EventListener
public interface
IIOWriteProgressListener
extends
EventListener
An interface used by
ImageWriter
implementations to notify
 callers of their image writing methods of progress.

Method
Description
void
imageComplete
(
ImageWriter
source)

write
call within the associated
ImageWriter
.
void

void
writeAborted
(
ImageWriter
source)
Reports that a write has been aborted via the writer's
abort
method.
Method Details
imageStarted
void
imageStarted
(
ImageWriter
source,
 int imageIndex)
Reports that an image write operation is beginning.  All
ImageWriter
implementations are required to call
 this method exactly once when beginning an image write
 operation.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageWriter
object calling this
 method.
imageIndex
- the index of the image being written within
 its containing input file or stream.
imageProgress
void
imageProgress
(
ImageWriter
source,
 float percentageDone)
Reports the approximate degree of completion of the current
write
call within the associated
ImageWriter
.
The degree of completion is expressed as an index
 indicating which image is being written, and a percentage
 varying from
0.0F
to
100.0F
indicating how much of the current image has been output.  The
 percentage should ideally be calculated in terms of the
 remaining time to completion, but it is usually more practical
 to use a more well-defined metric such as pixels decoded or
 portion of input stream consumed.  In any case, a sequence of
 calls to this method during a given read operation should
 supply a monotonically increasing sequence of percentage
 values.  It is not necessary to supply the exact values
0
and
100
, as these may be inferred
 by the callee from other methods.
Each particular
ImageWriter
implementation may
 call this method at whatever frequency it desires.  A rule of
 thumb is to call it around each 5 percent mark.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageWriter
object calling this method.
percentageDone
- the approximate percentage of decoding that
 has been completed.
imageComplete
void
imageComplete
(
ImageWriter
source)
Reports that the image write operation has completed.  All
ImageWriter
implementations are required to call
 this method exactly once upon completion of each image write
 operation.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageWriter
object calling this method.
thumbnailStarted
void
thumbnailStarted
(
ImageWriter
source,
 int imageIndex,
 int thumbnailIndex)
Reports that a thumbnail write operation is beginning.  All
ImageWriter
implementations are required to call
 this method exactly once when beginning a thumbnail write
 operation.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageWrite
object calling this method.
imageIndex
- the index of the image being written within its
 containing input file or stream.
thumbnailIndex
- the index of the thumbnail being written.
thumbnailProgress
void
thumbnailProgress
(
ImageWriter
source,
 float percentageDone)
Reports the approximate degree of completion of the current
 thumbnail write within the associated
ImageWriter
.
 The semantics are identical to those of
imageProgress
.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageWriter
object calling this
 method.
percentageDone
- the approximate percentage of decoding that
 has been completed.
thumbnailComplete
void
thumbnailComplete
(
ImageWriter
source)
Reports that a thumbnail write operation has completed.  All
ImageWriter
implementations are required to call
 this method exactly once upon completion of each thumbnail
 write operation.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageWriter
object calling this
 method.
writeAborted
void
writeAborted
(
ImageWriter
source)
Reports that a write has been aborted via the writer's
abort
method.  No further notifications will be
 given.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageWriter
object calling this
 method.
