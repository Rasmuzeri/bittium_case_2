Interface IIOReadProgressListener
All Superinterfaces:
EventListener
public interface
IIOReadProgressListener
extends
EventListener
An interface used by
ImageReader
implementations to
 notify callers of their image and thumbnail reading methods of
 progress.
This interface receives general indications of decoding
 progress (via the
imageProgress
and
thumbnailProgress
methods), and events indicating when
 an entire image has been updated (via the
imageStarted
,
imageComplete
,
thumbnailStarted
and
thumbnailComplete
methods).  Applications that wish to be informed of pixel updates
 as they happen (for example, during progressive decoding), should
 provide an
IIOReadUpdateListener
.

Method Details
sequenceStarted
void
sequenceStarted
(
ImageReader
source,
 int minIndex)
Reports that a sequence of read operations is beginning.
ImageReader
implementations are required to call
 this method exactly once from their
readAll(Iterator)
method.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageReader
object calling this method.
minIndex
- the index of the first image to be read.
sequenceComplete
void
sequenceComplete
(
ImageReader
source)
Reports that a sequence of read operations has completed.
ImageReader
implementations are required to call
 this method exactly once from their
readAll(Iterator)
method.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageReader
object calling this method.
imageStarted
void
imageStarted
(
ImageReader
source,
 int imageIndex)
Reports that an image read operation is beginning.  All
ImageReader
implementations are required to call
 this method exactly once when beginning an image read
 operation.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageReader
object calling this method.
imageIndex
- the index of the image being read within its
 containing input file or stream.
imageProgress
void
imageProgress
(
ImageReader
source,
 float percentageDone)
Reports the approximate degree of completion of the current
read
call of the associated
ImageReader
.
The degree of completion is expressed as a percentage
 varying from
0.0F
to
100.0F
.  The
 percentage should ideally be calculated in terms of the
 remaining time to completion, but it is usually more practical
 to use a more well-defined metric such as pixels decoded or
 portion of input stream consumed.  In any case, a sequence of
 calls to this method during a given read operation should
 supply a monotonically increasing sequence of percentage
 values.  It is not necessary to supply the exact values
0
and
100
, as these may be inferred
 by the callee from other methods.
Each particular
ImageReader
implementation may
 call this method at whatever frequency it desires.  A rule of
 thumb is to call it around each 5 percent mark.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageReader
object calling this method.
percentageDone
- the approximate percentage of decoding that
 has been completed.
imageComplete
void
imageComplete
(
ImageReader
source)
Reports that the current image read operation has completed.
 All
ImageReader
implementations are required to
 call this method exactly once upon completion of each image
 read operation.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageReader
object calling this
 method.
thumbnailStarted
void
thumbnailStarted
(
ImageReader
source,
 int imageIndex,
 int thumbnailIndex)
Reports that a thumbnail read operation is beginning.  All
ImageReader
implementations are required to call
 this method exactly once when beginning a thumbnail read
 operation.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageReader
object calling this method.
imageIndex
- the index of the image being read within its
 containing input file or stream.
thumbnailIndex
- the index of the thumbnail being read.
thumbnailProgress
void
thumbnailProgress
(
ImageReader
source,
 float percentageDone)
Reports the approximate degree of completion of the current
getThumbnail
call within the associated
ImageReader
.  The semantics are identical to those
 of
imageProgress
.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageReader
object calling this method.
percentageDone
- the approximate percentage of decoding that
 has been completed.
thumbnailComplete
void
thumbnailComplete
(
ImageReader
source)
Reports that a thumbnail read operation has completed.  All
ImageReader
implementations are required to call
 this method exactly once upon completion of each thumbnail read
 operation.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageReader
object calling this
 method.
readAborted
void
readAborted
(
ImageReader
source)
Reports that a read has been aborted via the reader's
abort
method.  No further notifications will be
 given.
Parameters:
source
- the
ImageReader
object calling this
 method.
