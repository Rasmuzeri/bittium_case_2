javax.imageio.event
A package of the Java Image I/O API dealing with synchronous notification of
 events during the reading and writing of images.
The
IIOReadProgressListener
interface allows for notification of the
 percentage of an image that has been read successfully.
The
IIOReadUpdateListener
interface allows for notification of the
 portions of an image that have been read. This is useful, for example, for
 implementing dynamic display of an image as it is loaded.
The
IIOReadWarningListener
interface allows for notification of
 non-fatal errors during reading.
The
IIOWriteWarningListener
and
IIOWriteProgressListener
interfaces perform analogous functions for writers.
