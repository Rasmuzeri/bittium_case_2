TIFFDirectory
extends

Cloneable
A convenience class for simplifying interaction with TIFF native
 image metadata. A TIFF image metadata tree represents an Image File
 Directory (IFD) from a TIFF 6.0 stream. An IFD consists of a number of
 IFD Entries each of which associates an identifying tag number with
 a compatible value. A
TIFFDirectory
instance corresponds
 to an IFD and contains a set of
TIFFField
s each of which
 corresponds to an IFD Entry in the IFD.
When reading, a
TIFFDirectory
may be created by passing
 the value returned by
ImageReader.getImageMetadata()
to
createFromMetadata()
. The
TIFFField
s in the directory may then
 be obtained using the accessor methods provided in this class.
When writing, an
IIOMetadata
object for use by one of the
write()
methods of
ImageWriter
may be
 created from a
TIFFDirectory
by
getAsMetadata()
.
 The
TIFFDirectory
itself may be created by construction or
 from the
IIOMetadata
object returned by
ImageWriter.getDefaultImageMetadata()
. The
TIFFField
s in the
 directory may be set using the mutator methods provided in this class.
A
TIFFDirectory
is aware of the tag numbers in the
 group of
TIFFTagSet
s associated with it. When
 a
TIFFDirectory
is created from a native image metadata
 object, these tag sets are derived from the
tagSets
attribute
 of the
TIFFIFD
node.
A
TIFFDirectory
might also have a parent
TIFFTag
.
 This will occur if the directory represents an IFD other than the root
 IFD of the image. The parent tag is the tag of the IFD Entry which is a
 pointer to the IFD represented by this
TIFFDirectory
. The
TIFFTag.isIFDPointer()
method of this parent
TIFFTag
must return
true
.  When a
TIFFDirectory
is
 created from a native image metadata object, the parent tag set is set
 from the
parentTagName
attribute of the corresponding
TIFFIFD
node. Note that a
TIFFDirectory
instance
 which has a non-
null
parent tag will be contained in the
 data field of a
TIFFField
instance which has a tag field
 equal to the contained directory's parent tag.
As an example consider an Exif image. The
TIFFDirectory
instance corresponding to the Exif IFD in the Exif stream would have parent
 tag
TAG_EXIF_IFD_POINTER
and would include
ExifTIFFTagSet
in its group of known tag sets.
 The
TIFFDirectory
corresponding to this Exif IFD will be
 contained in the data field of a
TIFFField
which will in turn
 be contained in the
TIFFDirectory
corresponding to the primary
 IFD of the Exif image which will itself have a
null
-valued
 parent tag.
Note that this implementation is not synchronized.
If multiple
 threads use a
TIFFDirectory
instance concurrently, and at
 least one of the threads modifies the directory, for example, by adding
 or removing
TIFFField
s or
TIFFTagSet
s, it
must
be synchronized externally.
