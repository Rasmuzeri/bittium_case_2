Public classes used by the built-in TIFF plug-ins.
This package contains classes supporting the built-in TIFF reader and writer
 plug-ins. Classes are provided for simplifying interaction with metadata,
 including Exif metadata common in digital photography, and an extension of
ImageReadParam
which permits specifying which metadata
 tags are allowed to be read. For more information about the operation of the
 built-in TIFF plug-ins, see the
TIFF metadata format
 specification and usage notes
