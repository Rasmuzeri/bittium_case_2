Package javax.imageio.stream
package
javax.imageio.stream
A package of the Java Image I/O API dealing with low-level I/O from files and
 streams.
The
ImageInputStream
interface unifies streaming and file-based
 operations. An abstract base class,
ImageInputStreamImpl
is provided
 to simplify writing a new
ImageInputStream
class. Concrete
 implementation classes (
FileImageInputStream
,
FileCacheImageInputStream
, and
MemoryCacheImageInputStream
)
 are provided that allow input to come from a
File
or
InputStream
with or without the use of a temporary cache file.
The
ImageOutputStream
interface performs an analogous function for
 output. An abstract base class,
ImageOutputStreamImpl
is provided,
 along with concrete implementation classes (
FileImageOutputStream
,
FileCacheImageOutputStream
, and
MemoryCacheImageOutputStream
)
 are provided that allow output to go to a
File
or
OutputStream
with or without the use of a temporary cache file.
The
IIOByteBuffer
class provides an alternative way to perform reads
 of sequences of bytes that reduces the amount of internal data copying.
