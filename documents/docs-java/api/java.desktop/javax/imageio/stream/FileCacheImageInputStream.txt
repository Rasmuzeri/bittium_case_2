Constructor Details
FileCacheImageInputStream
public
FileCacheImageInputStream
(
InputStream
stream,
File
cacheDir)
throws
IOException
Constructs a
FileCacheImageInputStream
that will read
 from a given
InputStream
.
A temporary file is used as a cache.  If
cacheDir
is non-
null
and is a
 directory, the file will be created there.  If it is
null
, the system-dependent default temporary-file
 directory will be used (see the documentation for
File.createTempFile
for details).
Parameters:
stream
- an
InputStream
to read from.
cacheDir
- a
File
indicating where the
 cache file should be created, or
null
to use the
 system directory.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
stream
is
null
.
IllegalArgumentException
- if
cacheDir
is
 non-
null
but is not a directory.
IOException
- if a cache file cannot be created.
Method Details
read
public
int
read
()
         throws
IOException
Description copied from class:
ImageInputStreamImpl
Reads a single byte from the stream and returns it as an
int
between 0 and 255.  If EOF is reached,
-1
is returned.
Subclasses must provide an implementation for this method.
 The subclass implementation should update the stream position
 before exiting.
The bit offset within the stream must be reset to zero before
 the read occurs.
Specified by:
read
in interface
ImageInputStream
Specified by:
read
in class
ImageInputStreamImpl
Returns:
the value of the next byte in the stream, or
-1
if EOF is reached.
Throws:
IOException
- if the stream has been closed.
read
public
int
read
(byte[] b,
 int off,
 int len)
throws
IOException
Description copied from class:
ImageInputStreamImpl
Reads up to
len
bytes from the stream, and stores
 them into
b
starting at index
off
.
 If no bytes can be read because the end of the stream has been
 reached,
-1
is returned.
The bit offset within the stream must be reset to zero before
 the read occurs.
Subclasses must provide an implementation for this method.
 The subclass implementation should update the stream position
 before exiting.
Specified by:
read
in interface
ImageInputStream
Specified by:
read
in class
ImageInputStreamImpl
Parameters:
b
- an array of bytes to be written to.
off
- the starting position within
b
to write to.
len
- the maximum number of bytes to read.
Returns:
the number of bytes actually read, or
-1
to indicate EOF.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
isCached

InputStream
is not closed.
Throws:
IOException
- if an error occurs.

Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Finalization has been deprecated for removal.  See
Object.finalize()
for background information and details
 about migration options.
Finalizes this object prior to garbage collection.  The
close
method is called to close any open input
 source.  This method should not be called from application
 code.
Overrides:
finalize
in class
ImageInputStreamImpl
Throws:
Throwable
- if an error occurs during superclass
 finalization.
