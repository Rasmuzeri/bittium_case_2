Constructor Details
FileCacheImageOutputStream
public
FileCacheImageOutputStream
(
OutputStream
stream,
File
cacheDir)
throws
IOException
Constructs a
FileCacheImageOutputStream
that will write
 to a given
outputStream
.
A temporary file is used as a cache.  If
cacheDir
is non-
null
and is a
 directory, the file will be created there.  If it is
null
, the system-dependent default temporary-file
 directory will be used (see the documentation for
File.createTempFile
for details).
Parameters:
stream
- an
OutputStream
to write to.
cacheDir
- a
File
indicating where the
 cache file should be created, or
null
to use the
 system directory.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
stream
is
null
.
IllegalArgumentException
- if
cacheDir
is
 non-
null
but is not a directory.
IOException
- if a cache file cannot be created.
Method Details
read
public
int
read
()
         throws
IOException
Description copied from class:
ImageInputStreamImpl
Reads a single byte from the stream and returns it as an
int
between 0 and 255.  If EOF is reached,
-1
is returned.
Subclasses must provide an implementation for this method.
 The subclass implementation should update the stream position
 before exiting.
The bit offset within the stream must be reset to zero before
 the read occurs.
Specified by:
read
in interface
ImageInputStream
Specified by:
read
in class
ImageInputStreamImpl
Returns:
the value of the next byte in the stream, or
-1
if EOF is reached.
Throws:
IOException
- if the stream has been closed.
read
public
int
read
(byte[] b,
 int off,
 int len)
throws
IOException
Description copied from class:
ImageInputStreamImpl
Reads up to
len
bytes from the stream, and stores
 them into
b
starting at index
off
.
 If no bytes can be read because the end of the stream has been
 reached,
-1
is returned.
The bit offset within the stream must be reset to zero before
 the read occurs.
Subclasses must provide an implementation for this method.
 The subclass implementation should update the stream position
 before exiting.
Specified by:
read
in interface
ImageInputStream
Specified by:
read
in class
ImageInputStreamImpl
Parameters:
b
- an array of bytes to be written to.
off
- the starting position within
b
to write to.
len
- the maximum number of bytes to read.
Returns:
the number of bytes actually read, or
-1
to indicate EOF.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
write
public
void
write
(int b)
throws
IOException
Description copied from interface:
ImageOutputStream
Writes a single byte to the stream at the current position.
 The 24 high-order bits of
b
are ignored.
If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
 remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
 and written out first.  The bit offset will be 0 after the
 write.  Implementers can use the
flushBits
method of
ImageOutputStreamImpl
to guarantee this.
Parameters:
b
- an
int
whose lower 8 bits are to be
 written.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
write
public
void
write
(byte[] b,
 int off,
 int len)
throws
IOException
Description copied from interface:
ImageOutputStream
Writes a sequence of bytes to the stream at the current
 position.  If
len
is 0, nothing is written.
 The byte
b[off]
is written first, then the byte
b[off + 1]
, and so on.
If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
 remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
 and written out first.  The bit offset will be 0 after the
 write.  Implementers can use the
flushBits
method of
ImageOutputStreamImpl
to guarantee this.
Parameters:
b
- an array of
byte
s to be written.
off
- the start offset in the data.
len
- the number of
byte
s to write.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
length
public
long
length
()
Description copied from class:
ImageInputStreamImpl
Returns
-1L
to indicate that the stream has unknown
 length.  Subclasses must override this method to provide actual
 length information.
Specified by:
length
in interface
ImageInputStream
Overrides:
length
in class
ImageInputStreamImpl
Returns:
-1L to indicate unknown length.
seek
public
void
seek
(long pos)
throws
IOException
Sets the current stream position and resets the bit offset to
 0.  It is legal to seek past the end of the file; an
EOFException
will be thrown only if a read is
 performed.  The file length will not be increased until a write
 is performed.
Parameters:
pos
- a
long
containing the desired file
 pointer position.
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- if
pos
is smaller
 than the flushed position.
IOException
- if any other I/O error occurs.
isCached
public
boolean
isCached
()
Returns
true
since this
ImageOutputStream
caches data in order to allow
 seeking backwards.
Specified by:
isCached
in interface
ImageInputStream
Overrides:
isCached
in class
ImageInputStreamImpl
Returns:
true
.
See Also:
isCachedMemory()
isCachedFile()
isCachedFile
public
boolean
isCachedFile
()
Returns
true
since this
ImageOutputStream
maintains a file cache.
Specified by:
isCachedFile
in interface
ImageInputStream
Overrides:
isCachedFile
in class
ImageInputStreamImpl
Returns:
true
.
See Also:
isCached()
isCachedMemory()
isCachedMemory
public
boolean
isCachedMemory
()
Returns
false
since this
ImageOutputStream
does not maintain a main memory
 cache.
Specified by:
isCachedMemory
in interface
ImageInputStream
Overrides:
isCachedMemory
in class
ImageInputStreamImpl
Returns:
false
.

isCachedFile()
close
public
void
close
()
           throws
IOException
Closes this
FileCacheImageOutputStream
.  All
 pending data is flushed to the output, and the cache file
 is closed and removed.  The destination
OutputStream
is not closed.
Throws:
IOException
- if an error occurs.
flushBefore
public
void
flushBefore
(long pos)
throws
IOException
Description copied from interface:
ImageOutputStream
Flushes all data prior to the given position to the underlying
 destination, such as an
OutputStream
or
File
.  Attempting to seek to the flushed portion
 of the stream will result in an
IndexOutOfBoundsException
.
Parameters:
pos
- a
long
containing the length of the
 stream prefix that may be flushed to the destination.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
