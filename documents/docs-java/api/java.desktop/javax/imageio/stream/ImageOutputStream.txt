public interface
ImageOutputStream
extends
ImageInputStream
,
DataOutput
A seekable output stream interface for use by
ImageWriter
s.  Various output destinations, such as
OutputStream
s and
File
s, as well as
 future fast I/O destinations may be "wrapped" by a suitable
 implementation of this interface for use by the Image I/O API.
Unlike a standard
OutputStream
, ImageOutputStream
 extends its counterpart,
ImageInputStream
.  Thus it is
 possible to read from the stream as it is being written.  The same
 seek and flush positions apply to both reading and writing, although
 the semantics for dealing with a non-zero bit offset before a byte-aligned
 write are necessarily different from the semantics for dealing with
 a non-zero bit offset before a byte-aligned read.  When reading bytes,
 any bit offset is set to 0 before the read; when writing bytes, a
 non-zero bit offset causes the remaining bits in the byte to be written
 as 0s. The byte-aligned write then starts at the next byte position.

write
void
write
(int b)
throws
IOException
Writes a single byte to the stream at the current position.
 The 24 high-order bits of
b
are ignored.
If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
 remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
 and written out first.  The bit offset will be 0 after the
 write.  Implementers can use the
flushBits
method of
ImageOutputStreamImpl
to guarantee this.
Specified by:
write
in interface
DataOutput
Parameters:
b
- an
int
whose lower 8 bits are to be
 written.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
write
void
write
(byte[] b)
throws
IOException
Writes a sequence of bytes to the stream at the current
 position.  If
b.length
is 0, nothing is written.
 The byte
b[0]
is written first, then the byte
b[1]
, and so on.
If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
 remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
 and written out first.  The bit offset will be 0 after the
 write.
Specified by:
write
in interface
DataOutput
Parameters:
b
- an array of
byte
s to be written.

write
void
write
(byte[] b,
 int off,
 int len)
throws
IOException
Writes a sequence of bytes to the stream at the current
 position.  If
len
is 0, nothing is written.
 The byte
b[off]
is written first, then the byte
b[off + 1]
, and so on.
If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
 remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
 and written out first.  The bit offset will be 0 after the
 write.  Implementers can use the
flushBits
method of
ImageOutputStreamImpl
to guarantee this.
Specified by:
write
in interface
DataOutput
Parameters:

writeBytes
void
writeBytes
(
String
s)
throws
IOException
Writes a string to the output stream. For every character in
 the string
s
, taken in order, one byte is written
 to the output stream. If
s
is
null
, a
NullPointerException
is thrown.
If
s.length
is zero, then no bytes are
 written. Otherwise, the character
s[0]
is written
 first, then
s[1]
, and so on; the last character
 written is
s[s.length-1]
. For each character, one
 byte is written, the low-order byte, in exactly the manner of
 the
writeByte
method. The high-order eight bits of
 each character in the string are ignored.
If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
 remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
 and written out first.  The bit offset will be 0 after the
 write.
Specified by:
writeBytes
in interface
DataOutput
Parameters:
s
- a
String
containing the value to be
 written.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
s
is
null
.
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
writeChars
void
writeChars
(
String
s)
throws
IOException
Writes a string to the output stream. For every character in
 the string
s
, taken in order, two bytes are
 written to the output stream, ordered according to the current
 byte order setting.  If network byte order is being used, the
 high-order byte is written first; the order is reversed
 otherwise.  If
s
is
null
, a
NullPointerException
is thrown.
If
s.length
is zero, then no bytes are
 written. Otherwise, the character
s[0]
is written
 first, then
s[1]
, and so on; the last character
 written is
s[s.length-1]
.
If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
 remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
 and written out first.  The bit offset will be 0 after the
 write.
Specified by:
writeChars
in interface
DataOutput
Parameters:
s
- a
String
containing the value to be
 written.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
s
is
null
.
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
writeUTF
void
writeUTF
(
String
s)
throws
IOException
Writes two bytes of length information to the output stream in
 network byte order, followed by the
modified UTF-8
representation of every character in the string
s
.
 If
s
is
null
, a
NullPointerException
is thrown.  Each character in
 the string
s
is converted to a group of one, two,
 or three bytes, depending on the value of the character.
If a character
c
is in the range
\u0001
through
\u007f
, it is
 represented by one byte:
(byte)c
If a character
c
is
\u0000
or
 is in the range
\u0080
through
\u07ff
, then it is represented by two bytes,
 to be written in the order shown:
(byte)(0xc0 | (0x1f & (c >> 6)))
 (byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
If a character
c
is in the range
\u0800
through
uffff
, then it is
 represented by three bytes, to be written in the order shown:
(byte)(0xe0 | (0x0f & (c >> 12)))
 (byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & (c >> 6)))
 (byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
First, the total number of bytes needed to represent all
 the characters of
s
is calculated. If this number
 is larger than
65535
, then a
UTFDataFormatException
is thrown. Otherwise, this
 length is written to the output stream in exactly the manner of
 the
writeShort
method; after this, the one-, two-,
 or three-byte representation of each character in the string
s
is written.
The current byte order setting is ignored.
If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
 remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
 and written out first.  The bit offset will be 0 after the
 write.
Note:
This method should not be used in
 the  implementation of image formats that use standard UTF-8,
 because  the modified UTF-8 used here is incompatible with
 standard UTF-8.
Specified by:
writeUTF
in interface
DataOutput
Parameters:
s
- a
String
containing the value to be
 written.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
s
is
null
.
UTFDataFormatException
- if the modified UTF-8
 representation of
s
requires more than 65536 bytes.
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.

void
writeShorts
(short[] s,
 int off,
 int len)
throws
IOException
Writes a sequence of shorts to the stream at the current
 position.  If
len
is 0, nothing is written.
 The short
s[off]
is written first, then the short
s[off + 1]
, and so on.  The byte order of the
 stream is used to determine the order in which the individual
 bytes are written.
If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
 remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
 and written out first.  The bit offset will be 0 after the
 write.

len
- the number of
float
s to write.
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- if
off
is
 negative,
len
is negative, or
off + len
is greater than
f.length
.
NullPointerException
- if
f
is
null
.
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
writeDoubles
void
writeDoubles
(double[] d,
 int off,
 int len)
throws
IOException
Writes a sequence of doubles to the stream at the current
 position.  If
len
is 0, nothing is written.
 The double
d[off]
is written first, then the double
d[off + 1]
, and so on.  The byte order of the
 stream is used to determine the order in which the individual
 bytes are written.
If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the
 remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s
 and written out first.  The bit offset will be 0 after the
 write.
Parameters:
d
- an array of
doubles
s to be written.
off
- the start offset in the data.
len
- the number of
double
s to write.
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- if
off
is
 negative,
len
is negative, or
off + len
is greater than
d.length
.
NullPointerException
- if
d
is
null
.
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
writeBit
void
writeBit
(int bit)
throws
IOException
Writes a single bit, given by the least significant bit of the
 argument, to the stream at the current bit offset within the
 current byte position.  The upper 31 bits of the argument are
 ignored.  The given bit replaces the previous bit at that
 position.  The bit offset is advanced by one and reduced modulo
 8.
If any bits of a particular byte have never been set
 at the time the byte is flushed to the destination, those
 bits will be set to 0 automatically.
Parameters:
bit
- an
int
whose least significant bit
 is to be written to the stream.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
writeBits
void
writeBits
(long bits,
 int numBits)
throws
IOException
Writes a sequence of bits, given by the
numBits
least significant bits of the
bits
argument in
 left-to-right order, to the stream at the current bit offset
 within the current byte position.  The upper
64 - numBits
bits of the argument are ignored.  The bit
 offset is advanced by
numBits
and reduced modulo
 8.  Note that a bit offset of 0 always indicates the
 most-significant bit of the byte, and bytes of bits are written
 out in sequence as they are encountered.  Thus bit writes are
 always effectively in network byte order.  The actual stream
 byte order setting is ignored.
Bit data may be accumulated in memory indefinitely, until
flushBefore
is called.  At that time, all bit data
 prior to the flushed position will be written.
If any bits of a particular byte have never been set
 at the time the byte is flushed to the destination, those
 bits will be set to 0 automatically.
Parameters:
bits
- a
long
containing the bits to be
 written, starting with the bit in position
numBits - 1
down to the least significant bit.
numBits
- an
int
between 0 and 64, inclusive.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
numBits
is
 not between 0 and 64, inclusive.
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
flushBefore
void
flushBefore
(long pos)
throws
IOException
Flushes all data prior to the given position to the underlying
 destination, such as an
OutputStream
or
File
.  Attempting to seek to the flushed portion
 of the stream will result in an
IndexOutOfBoundsException
.
Specified by:
flushBefore
in interface
ImageInputStream
Parameters:
pos
- a
long
containing the length of the
 stream prefix that may be flushed to the destination.
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- if
pos
lies
 in the flushed portion of the stream or past the current stream
 position.
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
