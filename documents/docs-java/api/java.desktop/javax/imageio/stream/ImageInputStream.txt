Method Details
setByteOrder
void
setByteOrder
(
ByteOrder
byteOrder)
Sets the desired byte order for future reads of data values
 from this stream.  For example, the sequence of bytes '0x01
 0x02 0x03 0x04' if read as a 4-byte integer would have the
 value '0x01020304' using network byte order and the value
 '0x04030201' under the reverse byte order.
The enumeration class
java.nio.ByteOrder
is
 used to specify the byte order.  A value of
ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN
specifies so-called
 big-endian or network byte order, in which the high-order byte
 comes first.  Motorola and Sparc processors store data in this
 format, while Intel processors store data in the reverse
ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN
order.
The byte order has no effect on the results returned from
 the
readBits
method (or the value written by
ImageOutputStream.writeBits
).
Parameters:
byteOrder
- one of
ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN
or
java.nio.ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN
, indicating whether
 network byte order or its reverse will be used for future
 reads.

ByteOrder
getByteOrder
()

enumeration.
Returns:
one of
ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN
or
ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN
, indicating which byte
 order is being used.

readLine
String
readLine
()
         throws
IOException
Reads the next line of text from the input stream.  It reads
 successive bytes, converting each byte separately into a
 character, until it encounters a line terminator or end of
 file; the characters read are then returned as a
String
. Note that because this method processes
 bytes, it does not support input of the full Unicode character
 set.
If end of file is encountered before even one byte can be
 read, then
null
is returned. Otherwise, each byte
 that is read is converted to type
char
by
 zero-extension. If the character
'\n'
is
 encountered, it is discarded and reading ceases. If the
 character
'\r'
is encountered, it is discarded
 and, if the following byte converts to the character
'\n'
, then that is discarded also; reading then
 ceases. If end of file is encountered before either of the
 characters
'\n'
and
'\r'
is
 encountered, reading ceases. Once reading has ceased, a
String
is returned that contains all the
 characters read and not discarded, taken in order.  Note that
 every character in this string will have a value less than
\u0100
, that is,
(char)256
.
The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
 the read occurs.
Specified by:
readLine
in interface
DataInput
Returns:
a String containing a line of text from the stream.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
readUTF
String
readUTF
()
        throws
IOException
Reads in a string that has been encoded using a
modified UTF-8
format.  The general contract of
readUTF
is that
 it reads a representation of a Unicode character string encoded
 in modified UTF-8 format; this string of characters is
 then returned as a
String
.
First, two bytes are read and used to construct an unsigned
 16-bit integer in the manner of the
readUnsignedShort
method, using network byte order
 (regardless of the current byte order setting). This integer
 value is called the
UTF length
and specifies the number
 of additional bytes to be read. These bytes are then converted
 to characters by considering them in groups. The length of each
 group is computed from the value of the first byte of the
 group. The byte following a group, if any, is the first byte of
 the next group.
If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern
0xxxxxxx
(where
x
means "may be
0
or
1
"), then the group consists of
 just that byte. The byte is zero-extended to form a character.
If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern
110xxxxx
, then the group consists of that byte
a
and a second byte
b
. If there is no
 byte
b
(because byte
a
was the last
 of the bytes to be read), or if byte
b
does not
 match the bit pattern
10xxxxxx
, then a
UTFDataFormatException
is thrown. Otherwise, the
 group is converted to the character:
(char)(((a& 0x1F) << 6) | (b & 0x3F))
If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern
1110xxxx
, then the group consists of that byte
a
and two more bytes
b
and
c
.  If there is no byte
c
(because
 byte
a
was one of the last two of the bytes to be
 read), or either byte
b
or byte
c
does not match the bit pattern
10xxxxxx
, then a
UTFDataFormatException
is thrown. Otherwise, the
 group is converted to the character:
(char)(((a & 0x0F) << 12) | ((b & 0x3F) << 6) | (c & 0x3F))
If the first byte of a group matches the pattern
1111xxxx
or the pattern
10xxxxxx
,
 then a
UTFDataFormatException
is thrown.
If end of file is encountered at any time during this
 entire process, then a
java.io.EOFException
is thrown.
After every group has been converted to a character by this
 process, the characters are gathered, in the same order in
 which their corresponding groups were read from the input
 stream, to form a
String
, which is returned.
The current byte order setting is ignored.
The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
 the read occurs.
Note:
This method should not be used in
 the  implementation of image formats that use standard UTF-8,
 because  the modified UTF-8 used here is incompatible with
 standard UTF-8.
Specified by:
readUTF
in interface
DataInput
Returns:
a String read from the stream.
Throws:
EOFException
- if this stream reaches the end
 before reading all the bytes.
UTFDataFormatException
- if the bytes do not represent
 a valid modified UTF-8 encoding of a string.
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.

getStreamPosition
long
getStreamPosition
()
                throws
IOException
Returns the current byte position of the stream.  The next read
 will take place starting at this offset.
Returns:
a long containing the position of the stream.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
getBitOffset
int
getBitOffset
()
          throws
IOException
Returns the current bit offset, as an integer between 0 and 7,
 inclusive.  The bit offset is updated implicitly by calls to
 the
readBits
method.  A value of 0 indicates the
 most-significant bit, and a value of 7 indicates the least
 significant bit, of the byte being read.
The bit offset is set to 0 when a stream is first
 opened, and is reset to 0 by calls to
seek
,
skipBytes
, or any
read
or
readFully
method.
Returns:
an
int
containing the bit offset between
 0 and 7, inclusive.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
See Also:
setBitOffset(int)
setBitOffset
void
setBitOffset
(int bitOffset)
throws
IOException
Sets the bit offset to an integer between 0 and 7, inclusive.
 The byte offset within the stream, as returned by
getStreamPosition
, is left unchanged.
 A value of 0 indicates the
 most-significant bit, and a value of 7 indicates the least
 significant bit, of the byte being read.
Parameters:
bitOffset
- the desired offset, as an
int
between 0 and 7, inclusive.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
bitOffset
is not between 0 and 7, inclusive.
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
See Also:
getBitOffset()
readBit
int
readBit
()
     throws
IOException
Reads a single bit from the stream and returns it as an
int
with the value
0
or
1
.  The bit offset is advanced by one and reduced
 modulo 8.
Returns:
an
int
containing the value
0
or
1
.
Throws:
EOFException
- if the stream reaches the end before
 reading all the bits.
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
readBits
long
readBits
(int numBits)
throws
IOException
Reads a bitstring from the stream and returns it as a
long
, with the first bit read becoming the most
 significant bit of the output.  The read starts within the byte
 indicated by
getStreamPosition
, at the bit given
 by
getBitOffset
.  The bit offset is advanced by
numBits
and reduced modulo 8.
The byte order of the stream has no effect on this
 method.  The return value of this method is constructed as
 though the bits were read one at a time, and shifted into
 the right side of the return value, as shown by the following
 pseudo-code:
long accum = 0L;
 for (int i = 0; i < numBits; i++) {
   accum <<= 1; // Shift left one bit to make room
   accum |= readBit();
 }
Note that the result of
readBits(32)
may thus not
 be equal to that of
readInt()
if a reverse network
 byte order is being used (i.e.,
getByteOrder() == false
).
If the end of the stream is encountered before all the bits
 have been read, a
java.io.EOFException
is thrown.
Parameters:
numBits
- the number of bits to read, as an
int
between 0 and 64, inclusive.
Returns:
the bitstring, as a
long
with the last bit
 read stored in the least significant bit.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
numBits
is not between 0 and 64, inclusive.
EOFException
- if the stream reaches the end before
 reading all the bits.
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
length
long
length
()
     throws
IOException
Returns the total length of the stream, if known.  Otherwise,
-1
is returned.
Returns:
a
long
containing the length of the
 stream, if known, or else
-1
.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
skipBytes
int
skipBytes
(int n)
throws
IOException
Moves the stream position forward by a given number of bytes.  It
 is possible that this method will only be able to skip forward
 by a smaller number of bytes than requested, for example if the
 end of the stream is reached.  In all cases, the actual number
 of bytes skipped is returned.  The bit offset is set to zero
 prior to advancing the position.
Specified by:
skipBytes
in interface
DataInput
Parameters:
n
- an
int
containing the number of bytes to
 be skipped.
Returns:
an
int
representing the number of bytes skipped.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
skipBytes
long
skipBytes
(long n)
throws
IOException
Moves the stream position forward by a given number of bytes.
 This method is identical to
skipBytes(int)
except
 that it allows for a larger skip distance.
Parameters:
n
- a
long
containing the number of bytes to
 be skipped.
Returns:
a
long
representing the number of bytes
 skipped.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
seek
void
seek
(long pos)
throws
IOException
Sets the current stream position to the desired location.  The
 next read will occur at this location.  The bit offset is set
 to 0.
An
IndexOutOfBoundsException
will be thrown if
pos
is smaller than the flushed position (as
 returned by
getflushedPosition
).
It is legal to seek past the end of the file;
 a
java.io.EOFException
will be thrown only if a read is
 performed.
Parameters:
pos
- a
long
containing the desired file
 pointer position.
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- if
pos
is smaller
 than the flushed position.
IOException
- if any other I/O error occurs.
mark
void
mark
()
Marks a position in the stream to be returned to by a
 subsequent call to
reset
.  Unlike a standard
InputStream
, all
ImageInputStream
s
 support marking.  Additionally, calls to
mark
and
reset
may be nested arbitrarily.
Unlike the
mark
methods declared by the
Reader
and
InputStream
interfaces, no
readLimit
parameter is used.  An arbitrary amount
 of data may be read following the call to
mark
.
The bit position used by the
readBits
method
 is saved and restored by each pair of calls to
mark
and
reset
.
Note that it is valid for an
ImageReader
to call
flushBefore
as part of a read operation.
 Therefore, if an application calls
mark
prior to
 passing that stream to an
ImageReader
, the application
 should not assume that the marked position will remain valid after
 the read operation has completed.
reset
void
reset
()
    throws
IOException
Returns the stream pointer to its previous position, including
 the bit offset, at the time of the most recent unmatched call
 to
mark
.
Calls to
reset
without a corresponding call
 to
mark
have no effect.
An
IOException
will be thrown if the previous
 marked position lies in the discarded portion of the stream.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
flushBefore
void
flushBefore
(long pos)
throws
IOException
Discards the initial portion of the stream prior to the
 indicated position.  Attempting to seek to an offset within the
 flushed portion of the stream will result in an
IndexOutOfBoundsException
.
Calling
flushBefore
may allow classes
 implementing this interface to free up resources such as memory
 or disk space that are being used to store data from the
 stream.
Parameters:
pos
- a
long
containing the length of the
 stream prefix that may be flushed.
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- if
pos
lies
 in the flushed portion of the stream or past the current stream
 position.
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
flush
void
flush
()
    throws
IOException
Discards the initial position of the stream prior to the current
 stream position.  Equivalent to
flushBefore(getStreamPosition())
.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
getFlushedPosition
long
getFlushedPosition
()
Returns the earliest position in the stream to which seeking
 may be performed.  The returned value will be the maximum of
 all values passed into previous calls to
flushBefore
.
Returns:
the earliest legal position for seeking, as a
long
.
isCached
boolean
isCached
()
Returns
true
if this
ImageInputStream
caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards.
 Applications may consult this in order to decide how frequently,
 or whether, to flush in order to conserve cache resources.
Returns:
true
if this
ImageInputStream
caches data.
See Also:
isCachedMemory()
isCachedFile()
isCachedMemory
boolean
isCachedMemory
()
Returns
true
if this
ImageInputStream
caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards, and
 the cache is kept in main memory.  Applications may consult
 this in order to decide how frequently, or whether, to flush
 in order to conserve cache resources.
Returns:
true
if this
ImageInputStream
caches data in main memory.
See Also:
isCached()
isCachedFile()
isCachedFile
boolean
isCachedFile
()
Returns
true
if this
ImageInputStream
caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards, and
 the cache is kept in a temporary file.  Applications may consult
 this in order to decide how frequently, or whether, to flush
 in order to conserve cache resources.
Returns:
true
if this
ImageInputStream
caches data in a temporary file.
See Also:
isCached()
isCachedMemory()
close
void
close
()
    throws
IOException
Closes the stream.  Attempts to access a stream that has been
 closed may result in
IOException
s or incorrect
 behavior.  Calling this method may allow classes implementing
 this interface to release resources associated with the stream
 such as memory, disk space, or file descriptors.
Specified by:
close
in interface
AutoCloseable
Specified by:
close
in interface
Closeable
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
