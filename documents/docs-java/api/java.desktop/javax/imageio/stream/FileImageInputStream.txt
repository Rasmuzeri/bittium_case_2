Constructor Details
FileImageInputStream
public
FileImageInputStream
(
File
f)
throws
FileNotFoundException
,
IOException
Constructs a
FileImageInputStream
that will read
 from a given
File
.
The file contents must not change between the time this
 object is constructed and the time of the last call to a read
 method.
Parameters:
f
- a
File
to read from.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
f
is
null
.
SecurityException
- if a security manager exists
 and does not allow read access to the file.
FileNotFoundException
- if
f
is a
 directory or cannot be opened for reading for any other reason.
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
FileImageInputStream

Constructs a
FileImageInputStream
that will read
 from a given
RandomAccessFile
.
The file contents must not change between the time this
 object is constructed and the time of the last call to a read
 method.
Parameters:
raf
- a
RandomAccessFile
to read from.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
raf
is
null
.
Method Details

read
()
         throws
IOException
Description copied from class:
ImageInputStreamImpl
Reads a single byte from the stream and returns it as an
int
between 0 and 255.  If EOF is reached,
-1
is returned.
Subclasses must provide an implementation for this method.
 The subclass implementation should update the stream position
 before exiting.
The bit offset within the stream must be reset to zero before
 the read occurs.
Specified by:
read
in interface
ImageInputStream
Specified by:
read
in class
ImageInputStreamImpl
Returns:
the value of the next byte in the stream, or
-1
if EOF is reached.
Throws:
IOException
- if the stream has been closed.
read
public
int
read
(byte[] b,
 int off,
 int len)
throws
IOException
Description copied from class:
ImageInputStreamImpl
Reads up to
len
bytes from the stream, and stores
 them into
b
starting at index
off
.
 If no bytes can be read because the end of the stream has been
 reached,
-1
is returned.
The bit offset within the stream must be reset to zero before
 the read occurs.
Subclasses must provide an implementation for this method.
 The subclass implementation should update the stream position
 before exiting.
Specified by:
read
in interface
ImageInputStream
Specified by:
read
in class
ImageInputStreamImpl
Parameters:
b
- an array of bytes to be written to.
off
- the starting position within
b
to write to.
len
- the maximum number of bytes to read.
Returns:
the number of bytes actually read, or
-1
to indicate EOF.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
length
public
long
length
()
Returns the length of the underlying file, or
-1
if it is unknown.
Specified by:
length
in interface
ImageInputStream
Overrides:
length
in class
ImageInputStreamImpl
Returns:
the file length as a
long
, or
-1
.

Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Finalization has been deprecated for removal.  See
Object.finalize()
for background information and details
 about migration options.
Finalizes this object prior to garbage collection.  The
close
method is called to close any open input
 source.  This method should not be called from application
 code.
Overrides:
finalize
in class
ImageInputStreamImpl
Throws:
Throwable
- if an error occurs during superclass
 finalization.
