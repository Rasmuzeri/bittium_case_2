javax.imageio.metadata
A package of the Java Image I/O API dealing with reading and writing
 metadata.
When reading an image, its per-stream and per-image metadata is made
 available as an
IIOMetadata
object. The internals of this object are
 specific to the plug-in that created it. Its contents may be accessed in the
 form of an XML
Document
, which is implemented as a tree of
IIOMetadataNode
objects.
When writing an image, its metadata may be set by defining or modifying an
IIOMetadata
object. Such an object may be obtained from an
ImageWriter
or
ImageTranscoder
(from the
javax.imageio
package). Once such an object has been obtained, its
 contents may be set of modified via a
Document
consisting of
IIOMetadataNode
s. The document format may optionally be described
 using an
IIOMetadataFormat
object.
The format of the metadata contained in the XML
Document
is
 identified by a string which appears as the root node of the tree of
IIOMetadataNode
objects. This string contains a version number, e.g.
 "javax_imageio_jpeg_image_1.0". Readers and writers may support multiple
 versions of the same basic format and the Image I/O API has methods that
 allow specifying which version to use by passing the string to the
 method/constructor used to obtain an
IIOMetadata
object. In some
 cases, a more recent version may not be strictly compatible with a program
 written expecting an older version (for an example, see the Native Metadata
 Format section of the JPEG Metadata Usage Notes below).
Plug-ins may choose to support a
standard (plug-in neutral) format
. This format does not provide lossless encoding of metadata, but allows
 a portion of the metadata to be accessed in a generic manner.
Each of the standard plug-ins supports a so-called "native" metadata format,
 which encodes its metadata losslessly:
BMP metadata
GIF metadata
JPEG metadata
PNG metadata
TIFF metadata
WBMP metadata

1.4

Description
IIOInvalidTreeException
An
IIOInvalidTreeException
is thrown when an attempt
 by an
IIOMetadata
object to parse a tree of
IIOMetadataNode
s fails.
IIOMetadata
An abstract class to be extended by objects that represent metadata
 (non-image data) associated with images and streams.
IIOMetadataController
An interface to be implemented by objects that can determine the
 settings of an
IIOMetadata
object, either by putting
 up a GUI to obtain values from a user, or by other means.
IIOMetadataFormat
An object describing the structure of metadata documents returned
 from
IIOMetadata.getAsTree
and passed to
IIOMetadata.setFromTree
and
mergeTree
.
IIOMetadataFormatImpl
A concrete class providing a reusable implementation of the
IIOMetadataFormat
interface.
IIOMetadataNode
A class representing a node in a meta-data tree, which implements
 the
org.w3c.dom.Element
interface and additionally allows
 for the storage of non-textual objects via the
getUserObject
and
setUserObject
methods.
