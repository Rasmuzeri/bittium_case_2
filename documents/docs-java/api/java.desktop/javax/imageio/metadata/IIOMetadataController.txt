Interface IIOMetadataController
public interface
IIOMetadataController
An interface to be implemented by objects that can determine the
 settings of an
IIOMetadata
object, either by putting
 up a GUI to obtain values from a user, or by other means.  This
 interface merely specifies a generic
activate
method
 that invokes the controller, without regard for how the controller
 obtains values (
i.e.
, whether the controller puts up a GUI
 or merely computes a set of values is irrelevant to this
 interface).
Within the
activate
method, a controller obtains
 initial values by querying the
IIOMetadata
object's
 settings, either using the XML DOM tree or a plug-in specific
 interface, modifies values by whatever means, then modifies the
IIOMetadata
object's settings, using either the
setFromTree
or
mergeTree
methods, or a
 plug-in specific interface.  In general, applications may expect
 that when the
activate
method returns
true
, the
IIOMetadata
object is ready for
 use in a write operation.
Vendors may choose to provide GUIs for the
IIOMetadata
subclasses they define for a particular
 plug-in.  These can be set up as default controllers in the
 corresponding
IIOMetadata
subclasses.
Alternatively, an algorithmic process such as a database lookup
 or the parsing of a command line could be used as a controller, in
 which case the
activate
method would simply look up or
 compute the settings, call methods on
IIOMetadata
to
 set its state, and return
true
.

Description
boolean
activate
(
IIOMetadata

Activates the controller.
Method Details
activate
boolean
activate
(
IIOMetadata
metadata)
Activates the controller.  If
true
is returned,
 all settings in the
IIOMetadata
object should be
 ready for use in a write operation.  If
false
is
 returned, no settings in the
IIOMetadata
object
 will be disturbed (
i.e.
, the user canceled the
 operation).
Parameters:
metadata
- the
IIOMetadata
object to be modified.
Returns:
true
if the
IIOMetadata
has been
 modified,
false
otherwise.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
metadata
is
null
or is not an instance of the correct class.
