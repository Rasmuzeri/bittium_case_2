IIOServiceProvider
public
IIOServiceProvider
()
Constructs a blank
IIOServiceProvider
.  It is up
 to the subclass to initialize instance variables and/or
 override method implementations in order to ensure that the
getVendorName
and
getVersion
methods
 will return non-
null
values.
Method Details
onRegistration
public
void
onRegistration
(
ServiceRegistry
registry,
Class
<?> category)
A callback that will be called exactly once after the Spi class
 has been instantiated and registered in a
ServiceRegistry
.  This may be used to verify that
 the environment is suitable for this service, for example that
 native libraries can be loaded.  If the service cannot function
 in the environment where it finds itself, it should deregister
 itself from the registry.
Only the registry should call this method.
The default implementation does nothing.
Specified by:
onRegistration
in interface
RegisterableService
Parameters:
registry
- a
ServiceRegistry
where this
 object has been registered.
category
- a
Class
object indicating the
 registry category under which this object has been registered.
See Also:
ServiceRegistry.registerServiceProvider(Object provider)
onDeregistration
public
void
onDeregistration
(
ServiceRegistry
registry,
Class
<?> category)
A callback that will be whenever the Spi class has been
 deregistered from a
ServiceRegistry
.
Only the registry should call this method.
The default implementation does nothing.
Specified by:
onDeregistration
in interface
RegisterableService
Parameters:
registry
- a
ServiceRegistry
from which this
 object is being (wholly or partially) deregistered.
category
- a
Class
object indicating the
 registry category from which this object is being deregistered.
See Also:
ServiceRegistry.deregisterServiceProvider(Object provider)
getVendorName
public
String
getVendorName
()
Returns the name of the vendor responsible for creating this
 service provider and its associated implementation.  Because
 the vendor name may be used to select a service provider,
 it is not localized.
The default implementation returns the value of the
vendorName
instance variable.
Returns:
a non-
null String
containing
 the name of the vendor.
getVersion
public
String
getVersion
()
Returns a string describing the version
 number of this service provider and its associated
 implementation.  Because the version may be used by transcoders
 to identify the service providers they understand, this method
 is not localized.
The default implementation returns the value of the
version
instance variable.
Returns:
a non-
null String
containing
 the version of this service provider.
getDescription
public abstract
String
getDescription
(
Locale
locale)
Returns a brief, human-readable description of this service
 provider and its associated implementation.  The resulting
 string should be localized for the supplied
Locale
, if possible.
Parameters:
locale
- a
Locale
for which the return value
 should be localized.
Returns:
a
String
containing a description of this
 service provider.
