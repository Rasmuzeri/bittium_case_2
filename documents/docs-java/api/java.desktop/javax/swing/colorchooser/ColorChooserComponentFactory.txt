ColorChooserComponentFactory
extends
Object
A class designed to produce preconfigured "accessory" objects to
 insert into color choosers.
Warning:
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 of all JavaBeans
 has been added to the
java.beans
package.
