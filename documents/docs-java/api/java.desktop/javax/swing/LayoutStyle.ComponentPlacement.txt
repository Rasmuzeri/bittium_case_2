Enum Constant Details
RELATED
public static final
LayoutStyle.ComponentPlacement
RELATED
Enumeration value indicating the two components are
 visually related and will be placed in the same parent.
 For example, a
JLabel
providing a label for a
JTextField
is typically visually associated
 with the
JTextField
; the constant
RELATED
is used for this.
UNRELATED
public static final
LayoutStyle.ComponentPlacement
UNRELATED
Enumeration value indicating the two components are
 visually unrelated and will be placed in the same parent.
 For example, groupings of components are usually visually
 separated; the constant
UNRELATED
is used for this.
INDENT
public static final
LayoutStyle.ComponentPlacement
INDENT
Enumeration value indicating the distance to indent a component
 is being requested.  For example, often times the children of
 a label will be horizontally indented from the label.  To determine
 the preferred distance for such a gap use the
INDENT
type.
This value is typically only useful with a direction of
EAST
or
WEST
.
