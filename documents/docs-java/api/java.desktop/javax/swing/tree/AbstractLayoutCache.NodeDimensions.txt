public abstract
Rectangle
getNodeDimensions
(
Object
value,
 int row,
 int depth,
 boolean expanded,
Rectangle
bounds)
Returns, by reference in bounds, the size and x origin to
 place value at. The calling method is responsible for determining
 the Y location. If bounds is
null
, a newly created
Rectangle
should be returned,
 otherwise the value should be placed in bounds and returned.
Parameters:
value
- the
value
to be represented
row
- row being queried
depth
- the depth of the row
expanded
- true if row is expanded, false otherwise
bounds
- a
Rectangle
containing the size needed
              to represent
value
Returns:
a
Rectangle
containing the node dimensions,
              or
null
if node has no dimension
