package
javax.swing.tree
Provides classes and interfaces for dealing with
javax.swing.JTree
.
 You use these classes and interfaces if you want control over how trees are
 constructed, updated, and rendered, as well as how data associated with the
 tree nodes are viewed and managed.
Note:
Most of the Swing API is
not
thread safe. For details, see
Concurrency in Swing
,

The Java Tutorial
