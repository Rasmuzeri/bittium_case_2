Interface TreeCellRenderer
All Known Implementing Classes:
DefaultTreeCellRenderer
public interface

Defines the requirements for an object that displays a tree node.
 See
How to Use Trees
in
The Java Tutorial
for an example of implementing a tree cell renderer
 that displays custom icons.

getTreeCellRendererComponent
(
JTree

Method Details
getTreeCellRendererComponent
Component
getTreeCellRendererComponent
(
JTree
tree,
Object
value,
 boolean selected,
 boolean expanded,
 boolean leaf,
 int row,
 boolean hasFocus)
Sets the value of the current tree cell to
value
.
 If
selected
is true, the cell will be drawn as if
 selected. If
expanded
is true the node is currently
 expanded and if
leaf
is true the node represents a
 leaf and if
hasFocus
is true the node currently has
 focus.
tree
is the
JTree
the receiver is being
 configured for.  Returns the
Component
that the renderer
 uses to draw the value.
The
TreeCellRenderer
is also responsible for rendering the
 the cell representing the tree's current DnD drop location if
 it has one. If this renderer cares about rendering
 the DnD drop location, it should query the tree directly to
 see if the given row represents the drop location:
JTree.DropLocation dropLocation = tree.getDropLocation();
     if (dropLocation != null
             && dropLocation.getChildIndex() == -1
             && tree.getRowForPath(dropLocation.getPath()) == row) {

         // this row represents the current drop location
         // so render it specially, perhaps with a different color
     }
Parameters:
tree
- the receiver is being configured for
value
- the value to render
selected
- whether node is selected
expanded
- whether node is expanded
leaf
- whether node is a lead node
row
- row index
hasFocus
- whether node has focus
Returns:
the
Component
that the renderer uses to draw the value
