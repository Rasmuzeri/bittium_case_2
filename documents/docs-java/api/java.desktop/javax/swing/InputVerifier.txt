Class InputVerifier
java.lang.Object
javax.swing.InputVerifier
public abstract class
InputVerifier
extends
Object
This class provides the validation mechanism for Swing components. GUIs often
 need to ensure that the components are in a valid state before allowing the
 user to navigate the input focus. To do this, clients create a subclass of
InputVerifier
and, using
JComponent
's
setInputVerifier
method, attach an instance of their subclass to
 the
JComponent
which is the source of the focus transfer operation.
 The
InputVerifier
also provides the possibility to validate against
 the target of the focus transfer which may reject the focus.
 Before focus is transferred from the source Swing component to the target
 Swing component, the input verifier's
shouldYieldFocus(source, target)
method is called. Focus is
 transferred only if that method returns
true
.
The following example has two text fields, with the first one expecting
 the string "pass" to be entered by the user. If either that string is entered
 in the first text field or the second text field contains "accept" string,
 then the user can advance focus to the second text field by clicking in it or
 by pressing TAB.
 However, if another string is entered in the first text field and the second
 text field does not contain "accept", then the user will be unable to
 transfer focus to the second text field.
import java.awt.*;
 import javax.swing.*;

 // This program demonstrates the use of the Swing InputVerifier class.
 // It creates two text fields; the first of the text fields expects the
 // string "pass" as input, and will allow focus to advance to the second text
 // field if either that string is typed in by the user or the second
 // field contains "accept" string.

 public class VerifierTest extends JFrame {

     public VerifierTest() {
         JTextField field1 = new JTextField("Type \"pass\" here");
         JTextField field2 = new JTextField("or \"accept\" here");
         getContentPane().add(field1, BorderLayout.NORTH);
         getContentPane().add(field2, BorderLayout.SOUTH);

         field1.setInputVerifier(new InputVerifier() {
             public boolean verify(JComponent input) {
                return "pass".equals(((JTextField) input).getText());
             }

             public boolean verifyTarget(JComponent input) {
                 return "accept".equals(((JTextField) input).getText());
             }

             public boolean shouldYieldFocus(JComponent source,
                                                          JComponent target) {
                 return verify(source) || verifyTarget(target);
             }
         });

         pack();
         setVisible(true);
     }

     public static void main(String[] args) {
         SwingUtilities.invokeLater(VerifierTest::new);
     }

Method Details
verify
public abstract
boolean
verify
(
JComponent
input)
Checks whether the JComponent's input is valid. This method should
 have no side effects. It returns a boolean indicating the status
 of the argument's input.
Parameters:
input
- the JComponent to verify
Returns:
true
when valid,
false
when invalid

use
shouldYieldFocus(JComponent, JComponent)
instead.
Calls
verify(input)
to ensure that the input is valid.
 This method can have side effects. In particular, this method
 is called when the user attempts to advance focus out of the
 argument component into another Swing component in this window.
 If this method returns
true
, then the focus is transferred
 normally; if it returns
false
, then the focus remains in
 the argument component.
Parameters:
input
- the JComponent to verify
Returns:
true
when valid,
false
when invalid
See Also:
JComponent.setInputVerifier(javax.swing.InputVerifier)
JComponent.getInputVerifier()
verifyTarget
public
boolean
verifyTarget
(
JComponent
target)
Checks whether the target JComponent that will be receiving the focus
 is ready to accept it. This method should be over-ridden only if it is
 necessary to validate the target of the focus transfer.
 This method should have no side effects. It returns a boolean
 indicating the status of the argument's input.
Implementation Requirements:
By default this method returns
true
.
Parameters:
target
- the target JComponent to verify
Returns:
true
when valid,
false
when invalid

JComponent.getInputVerifier()
shouldYieldFocus
public
boolean
shouldYieldFocus
(
JComponent
source,
JComponent
target)
Is called by Swing if this
InputVerifier
is assigned to the
source
Swing component to check whether the requested focus
 transfer from the
source
to
target
is allowed.
 This method can have side effects.
 If this method returns
true
, then the focus is transferred
 normally; if it returns
false
, then the focus remains in
 the first argument component.
Implementation Requirements:
The basic implementation of this method returns the conjunction
 of results obtained from
verify(input)
and
verifyTarget(input)
to ensure that both the source and the target
 components are in valid state.
Parameters:
source
- the source JComponent of the focus transfer
target
- the target JComponent of the focus transfer
Returns:
true
when valid,
false
when invalid
