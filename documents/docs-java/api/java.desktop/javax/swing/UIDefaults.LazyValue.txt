Interface UIDefaults.LazyValue
All Known Implementing Classes:
UIDefaults.LazyInputMap
,
UIDefaults.ProxyLazyValue
Enclosing class:
UIDefaults
public static interface
UIDefaults.LazyValue
This class enables one to store an entry in the defaults
 table that isn't constructed until the first time it's
 looked up with one of the
getXXX(key)
methods.
 Lazy values are useful for defaults that are expensive
 to construct or are seldom retrieved.  The first time
 a
LazyValue
is retrieved its "real value" is computed
 by calling
LazyValue.createValue()
and the real
 value is used to replace the
LazyValue
in the
UIDefaults
table.  Subsequent lookups for the same key return
 the real value.  Here's an example of a
LazyValue
that constructs a
Border
:
Object borderLazyValue = new UIDefaults.LazyValue() {
      public Object createValue(UIDefaults table) {
          return new BorderFactory.createLoweredBevelBorder();
      }
  };

  uiDefaultsTable.put("MyBorder", borderLazyValue);

Object
createValue
(
UIDefaults
table)
Creates the actual value retrieved from the
UIDefaults
table. When an object that implements this interface is
 retrieved from the table, this method is used to create
 the real value, which is then stored in the table and
 returned to the calling method.
Parameters:
table
- a
UIDefaults
table
Returns:
the created
Object
