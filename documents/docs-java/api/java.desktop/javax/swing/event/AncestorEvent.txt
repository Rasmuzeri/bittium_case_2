Class AncestorEvent
java.lang.Object
java.util.EventObject
java.awt.AWTEvent
javax.swing.event.AncestorEvent
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
AncestorEvent
extends
AWTEvent
An event reported to a child component that originated from an
 ancestor in the component hierarchy.
Warning:
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 of all JavaBeans
 has been added to the
java.beans
package.

Constructor Details
AncestorEvent
public
AncestorEvent
(
JComponent
source,
 int id,
Container
ancestor,
Container
ancestorParent)
Constructs an AncestorEvent object to identify a change
 in an ancestor-component's display-status.
Parameters:
source
- the JComponent that originated the event
                        (typically
this
)
id
- an int specifying
ANCESTOR_ADDED
,
ANCESTOR_REMOVED
or
ANCESTOR_MOVED
ancestor
- a Container object specifying the ancestor-component
                        whose display-status changed
ancestorParent
- a Container object specifying the ancestor's parent
Method Details
getAncestor
public
Container
getAncestor
()
Returns the ancestor that the event actually occurred on.
Returns:
the
Container
object specifying the ancestor component
getAncestorParent
public
Container
getAncestorParent
()
Returns the parent of the ancestor the event actually occurred on.
 This is most interesting in an ANCESTOR_REMOVED event, as
 the ancestor may no longer be in the component hierarchy.
Returns:
the
Container
object specifying the ancestor's parent
getComponent
public
JComponent
getComponent
()
Returns the component that the listener was added to.
Returns:
the
JComponent
on which the event occurred
