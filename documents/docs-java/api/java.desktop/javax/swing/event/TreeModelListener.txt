 given node down.
Method Details
treeNodesChanged
void
treeNodesChanged
(
TreeModelEvent
e)
Invoked after a node (or a set of siblings) has changed in some
 way. The node(s) have not changed locations in the tree or
 altered their children arrays, but other attributes have
 changed and may affect presentation. Example: the name of a
 file has changed, but it is in the same location in the file
 system.
To indicate the root has changed, childIndices and children
 will be null.
Use
e.getPath()
to get the parent of the changed node(s).
e.getChildIndices()
returns the index(es) of the changed node(s).
Parameters:
e
- a
TreeModelEvent
describing changes to a tree model
treeNodesInserted
void
treeNodesInserted
(
TreeModelEvent
e)
Invoked after nodes have been inserted into the tree.
Use
e.getPath()
to get the parent of the new node(s).
e.getChildIndices()
returns the index(es) of the new node(s)
 in ascending order.
Parameters:
e
- a
TreeModelEvent
describing changes to a tree model
treeNodesRemoved
void
treeNodesRemoved
(
TreeModelEvent
e)
Invoked after nodes have been removed from the tree.  Note that
 if a subtree is removed from the tree, this method may only be
 invoked once for the root of the removed subtree, not once for
 each individual set of siblings removed.
Use
e.getPath()
to get the former parent of the deleted
 node(s).
e.getChildIndices()
returns, in ascending order, the
 index(es) the node(s) had before being deleted.
Parameters:
e
- a
TreeModelEvent
describing changes to a tree model
treeStructureChanged
void
treeStructureChanged
(
TreeModelEvent
e)
Invoked after the tree has drastically changed structure from a
 given node down.  If the path returned by e.getPath() is of length
 one and the first element does not identify the current root node
 the first element should become the new root of the tree.
Use
e.getPath()
to get the path to the node.
e.getChildIndices()
returns null.
Parameters:
e
- a
TreeModelEvent
describing changes to a tree model
