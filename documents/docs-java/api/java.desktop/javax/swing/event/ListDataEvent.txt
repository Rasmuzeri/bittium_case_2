Class ListDataEvent
java.lang.Object
java.util.EventObject
javax.swing.event.ListDataEvent
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
ListDataEvent
extends
EventObject
Defines an event that encapsulates changes to a list.
Warning:
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 of all JavaBeans
 has been added to the
java.beans
package.

ListDataEvent
public
ListDataEvent
(
Object
source,
 int type,
 int index0,
 int index1)
Constructs a ListDataEvent object. If index0 is >
 index1, index0 and index1 will be swapped such that
 index0 will always be <= index1.
Parameters:
source
- the source Object (typically
this
)
type
- an int specifying
CONTENTS_CHANGED
,
INTERVAL_ADDED
, or
INTERVAL_REMOVED
index0
- one end of the new interval
index1
- the other end of the new interval
Method Details
getType
public
int

()
Returns the event type. The possible values are:
CONTENTS_CHANGED
INTERVAL_ADDED
INTERVAL_REMOVED
Returns:
an int representing the type value

public
int
getIndex0
()
Returns the lower index of the range. For a single
 element, this value is the same as that returned by
getIndex1()
.
Returns:
an int representing the lower index value
getIndex1
public
int
getIndex1
()
Returns the upper index of the range. For a single
 element, this value is the same as that returned by
getIndex0()
.
Returns:
an int representing the upper index value
toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns a string representation of this ListDataEvent. This method
 is intended to be used only for debugging purposes, and the
 content and format of the returned string may vary between
 implementations. The returned string may be empty but may not
 be
null
.
Overrides:
toString
in class
EventObject
Returns:
a string representation of this ListDataEvent.
