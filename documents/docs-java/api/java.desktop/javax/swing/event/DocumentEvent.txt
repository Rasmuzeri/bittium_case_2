Interface DocumentEvent
All Known Implementing Classes:
AbstractDocument.DefaultDocumentEvent
public interface
DocumentEvent
Interface for document change notifications.  This provides
 detailed information to Document observers about how the
 Document changed.  It provides high level information such
 as type of change and where it occurred, as well as the more
 detailed structural changes (What Elements were inserted and
 removed).

DocumentEvent.ElementChange
getChange
(
Element
elem)
Gets the change information for the given element.
 The change information describes what elements were
 added and removed and the location.  If there were
 no changes, null is returned.
This method is for observers to discover the structural
 changes that were made.  This means that only elements
 that existed prior to the mutation (and still exist after
 the mutation) need to have ElementChange records.
 The changes made available need not be recursive.
For example, if an element is removed from its
 parent, this method should report that the parent
 changed and provide an ElementChange implementation
 that describes the change to the parent.  If the
 child element removed had children, these elements
 do not need to be reported as removed.
If a child element is inserted into a parent element,
 the parent element should report a change.  If the
 child element also had elements inserted into it
 (grandchildren to the parent) these elements need
 not report change.
Parameters:
elem
- the element
Returns:
the change information, or null if the
   element was not modified
