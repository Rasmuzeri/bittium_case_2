public interface
DocumentListener
extends
EventListener
Interface for an observer to register to receive notifications
 of changes to a text document.
The default implementation of
 the Document interface (AbstractDocument) supports asynchronous
 mutations.  If this feature is used (i.e. mutations are made
 from a thread other than the Swing event thread), the listeners
 will be notified via the mutating thread.
This means that
 if asynchronous updates are made, the implementation of this
 interface must be threadsafe
!
The DocumentEvent notification is based upon the JavaBeans
 event model.  There is no guarantee about the order of delivery
 to listeners, and all listeners must be notified prior to making
 further mutations to the Document.
This means implementations
 of the DocumentListener may not mutate the source of the event
 (i.e. the associated Document)
.
