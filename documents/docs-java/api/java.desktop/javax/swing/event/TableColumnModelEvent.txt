Class TableColumnModelEvent
java.lang.Object
java.util.EventObject
javax.swing.event.TableColumnModelEvent
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
TableColumnModelEvent
extends
EventObject
TableColumnModelEvent
is used to notify listeners that a table
 column model has changed, such as a column was added, removed, or
 moved.
Warning:
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 of all JavaBeans
 has been added to the
java.beans
package.
