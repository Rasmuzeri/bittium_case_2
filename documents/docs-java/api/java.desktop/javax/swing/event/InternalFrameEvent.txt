Class InternalFrameEvent
java.lang.Object
java.util.EventObject
java.awt.AWTEvent
javax.swing.event.InternalFrameEvent
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
InternalFrameEvent
extends
AWTEvent
An
AWTEvent
that adds support for
JInternalFrame
objects as the event source.  This class has the
 same event types as
WindowEvent
,
 although different IDs are used.
 Help on handling internal frame events
 is in
How to Write an Internal Frame Listener
,
 a section in
The Java Tutorial
.
Warning:
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 of all JavaBeans
 has been added to the
java.beans
package.
