javax.swing.event
Class ListSelectionEvent
java.lang.Object
java.util.EventObject
javax.swing.event.ListSelectionEvent
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
ListSelectionEvent
extends
EventObject
An event that characterizes a change in selection. The change is limited to a
 a single inclusive interval. The selection of at least one index within the
 range will have changed. A decent
ListSelectionModel
implementation
 will keep the range as small as possible.
ListSelectionListeners
will
 generally query the source of the event for the new selected status of each
 potentially changed row.
Warning:
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 of all JavaBeans
 has been added to the
java.beans
package.

, inclusive.
firstIndex
is less than or equal to
lastIndex
. The selection of at least one index within the range will
 have changed.
Parameters:
source
- the
Object
on which the event initially occurred
firstIndex
- the first index in the range, <= lastIndex
lastIndex
- the last index in the range, >= firstIndex
isAdjusting
- whether or not this is one in a series of
        multiple events, where changes are still being made
Method Details
getFirstIndex
public
int
getFirstIndex
()
Returns the index of the first row whose selection may have changed.
getFirstIndex() <= getLastIndex()
Returns:
the first row whose selection value may have changed,

getLastIndex
public
int
getLastIndex
()
Returns the index of the last row whose selection may have changed.
getLastIndex() >= getFirstIndex()
Returns:

getValueIsAdjusting
public
boolean
getValueIsAdjusting
()
