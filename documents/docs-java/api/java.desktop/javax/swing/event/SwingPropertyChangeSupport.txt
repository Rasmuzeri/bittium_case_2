java.beans.PropertyChangeSupport
javax.swing.event.SwingPropertyChangeSupport
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public final class
SwingPropertyChangeSupport
extends
PropertyChangeSupport
This subclass of
java.beans.PropertyChangeSupport
is almost
 identical in functionality. The only difference is if constructed with
SwingPropertyChangeSupport(sourceBean, true)
it ensures
 listeners are only ever notified on the
Event Dispatch Thread
.

Method Details
firePropertyChange
public
void
firePropertyChange
(
PropertyChangeEvent
evt)
Fires a property change event to listeners
 that have been registered to track updates of
 all properties or a property with the specified name.
No event is fired if the given event's old and new values are equal and non-null.
If
isNotifyOnEDT()
is
true
and called off the
Event Dispatch Thread
this implementation uses
SwingUtilities.invokeLater
to send out the notification
 on the
Event Dispatch Thread
. This ensures  listeners
 are only ever notified on the
Event Dispatch Thread
.
Overrides:
firePropertyChange

Parameters:
evt
- the
PropertyChangeEvent
to be fired
Throws:
NullPointerException

is
null
