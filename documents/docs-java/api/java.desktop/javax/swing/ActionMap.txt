Class ActionMap
java.lang.Object
javax.swing.ActionMap
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
Direct Known Subclasses:
ActionMapUIResource
public class
ActionMap
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
ActionMap
provides mappings from
Object
s
 (called
keys
or
Action
names
)
 to
Action
s.
 An
ActionMap
is usually used with an
InputMap
to locate a particular action
 when a key is pressed. As with
InputMap
,
 an
ActionMap
can have a parent
 that is searched for keys not defined in the
ActionMap
.
As with
InputMap
if you create a cycle, eg:
ActionMap am = new ActionMap();
   ActionMap bm = new ActionMap():
   am.setParent(bm);
   bm.setParent(am);
some of the methods will cause a StackOverflowError to be thrown.
Since:
1.3
