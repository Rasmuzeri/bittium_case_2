SpinnerModel
A model for a potentially unbounded sequence of object values.  This model
 is similar to
ListModel
however there are some important differences:
The number of sequence elements isn't necessarily bounded.
The model doesn't support indexed random access to sequence elements.
      Only three sequence values are accessible at a time: current, next and
      previous.
The current sequence element, can be set.
A
SpinnerModel
has three properties, only the first is read/write.
value
The current element of the sequence.
nextValue
The following element or null if
value
is the
     last element of the sequence.
previousValue
The preceding element or null if
value
is the
     first element of the sequence.
When the
value
property changes,
ChangeListeners
are notified.
SpinnerModel
may
 choose to notify the
ChangeListeners
under other circumstances.

Modifier and Type
Method
Description
void
addChangeListener
(
ChangeListener
l)
Adds a
ChangeListener
to the model's listener list.
Object
getNextValue
()
Return the object in the sequence that comes after the object returned
 by
getValue()
.
Object
getPreviousValue
()
Return the object in the sequence that comes before the object returned
 by
getValue()
.
Object
getValue
()
The
current element
of the sequence.
void
removeChangeListener
(
ChangeListener
l)
Removes a
ChangeListener
from the model's listener list.
void
setValue
(
Object
value)
Changes current value of the model, typically this value is displayed
 by the
editor
part of a
JSpinner
.
Method Details
getValue
Object
getValue
()
The
current element
of the sequence.  This element is usually
 displayed by the
editor
part of a
JSpinner
.
Returns:
the current spinner value.
See Also:
setValue(java.lang.Object)
setValue
void
setValue
(
Object
value)
Changes current value of the model, typically this value is displayed
 by the
editor
part of a
JSpinner
.
 If the
SpinnerModel
implementation doesn't support
 the specified value then an
IllegalArgumentException
is thrown.  For example a
SpinnerModel
for numbers might
 only support values that are integer multiples of ten. In
 that case,
model.setValue(new Number(11))
would throw an exception.
Parameters:
value
- new value for the spinner
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
value
isn't allowed

getValue()
getNextValue
Object
getNextValue
()
Return the object in the sequence that comes after the object returned
 by
getValue()
. If the end of the sequence has been reached
 then return null.  Calling this method does not effect
value
.
Returns:
the next legal value or null if one doesn't exist
See Also:
getValue()
getPreviousValue()
getPreviousValue
Object
getPreviousValue
()
Return the object in the sequence that comes before the object returned
 by
getValue()
.  If the end of the sequence has been reached then
 return null. Calling this method does not effect
value
.
Returns:
the previous legal value or null if one doesn't exist
See Also:
getValue()
getNextValue()
addChangeListener
void
addChangeListener
(
ChangeListener
l)
Adds a
ChangeListener
to the model's listener list.  The
ChangeListeners
must be notified when models
value
changes.
Parameters:
l
- the ChangeListener to add
See Also:
removeChangeListener(javax.swing.event.ChangeListener)
removeChangeListener
void
removeChangeListener
(
ChangeListener
l)
Removes a
ChangeListener
from the model's listener list.
Parameters:
l
- the ChangeListener to remove
