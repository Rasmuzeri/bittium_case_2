Annotation Interface SwingContainer

SwingContainer
An annotation used to specify some swing-related information
 for the automatically generated
BeanInfo
classes.
 This annotation is not used if the annotated class
 has a corresponding user-defined
BeanInfo
class,
 which does not imply the automatic analysis.
The
isContainer
feature attribute
was introduced primarily for the Swing library.
 All Swing components extend the
Container
class by design, so the builder tool assumes that all Swing components
 are containers.  The
BeanInfo
classes
 with the
isContainer
attribute allow to directly specify
 whether a Swing component is a container or not.
