Method Details
getRow
public
int
getRow
()
Returns the row index where a dropped item should be placed in the
 table. Interpretation of the value depends on the return of
isInsertRow()
. If that method returns
true
this value indicates the index where a new
 row should be inserted. Otherwise, it represents the value
 of an existing row on which the data was dropped. This index is
 in terms of the view.
-1
indicates that the drop occurred over empty space,
 and no row could be calculated.
Returns:
the drop row
