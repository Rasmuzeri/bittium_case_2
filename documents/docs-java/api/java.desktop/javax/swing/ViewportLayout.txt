Class ViewportLayout
java.lang.Object
javax.swing.ViewportLayout
All Implemented Interfaces:
LayoutManager
,
Serializable
public class
ViewportLayout
extends
Object
implements
LayoutManager
,
Serializable
The default layout manager for
JViewport
.
ViewportLayout
defines
 a policy for layout that should be useful for most applications.
 The viewport makes its view the same size as the viewport,
 however it will not make the view smaller than its minimum size.
 As the viewport grows the view is kept bottom justified until
 the entire view is visible, subsequently the view is kept top
 justified.
Warning:
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 of all JavaBeans
 has been added to the
java.beans
package.
