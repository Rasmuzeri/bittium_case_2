Class TransferHandler.DropLocation

javax.swing.TransferHandler.DropLocation
Direct Known Subclasses:

Enclosing class:
TransferHandler
public static class
TransferHandler.DropLocation
extends
Object
Represents a location where dropped data should be inserted.
 This is a base class that only encapsulates a point.
 Components supporting drop may provide subclasses of this
 containing more information.
Developers typically shouldn't create instances of, or extend, this
 class. Instead, these are something provided by the DnD
 implementation by
TransferSupport
instances and by
 components with a
getDropLocation()
method.
Since:
1.6
