Class InputMap
java.lang.Object
javax.swing.InputMap
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
Direct Known Subclasses:

,

public class
InputMap
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
InputMap
provides a binding between an input event (currently only
KeyStroke
s are used) and an
Object
.
InputMap
s are
 usually used with an
ActionMap
, to determine an
Action
to
 perform when a key is pressed. An
InputMap
can have a parent that
 is searched for bindings not defined in the
InputMap
.
As with
ActionMap
if you create a cycle, eg:
InputMap am = new InputMap();
   InputMap bm = new InputMap():
   am.setParent(bm);
   bm.setParent(am);
some of the methods will cause a StackOverflowError to be thrown.

Method Details
setParent
public
void
setParent
(
InputMap
map)
Sets this
InputMap
's parent.
Parameters:
map
- the
InputMap
that is the parent of this one
getParent
public
InputMap
getParent
()
Gets this
InputMap
's parent.
Returns:
map the
InputMap
that is the parent of this one,
             or null if this
InputMap
has no parent
put
public
void
put
(
KeyStroke
keyStroke,
Object
actionMapKey)
Adds a binding for
keyStroke
to
actionMapKey
.
 If
actionMapKey
is null, this removes the current binding
 for
keyStroke
.
Parameters:
keyStroke
- a
KeyStroke
actionMapKey
- an action map key
get
public
Object
get
(
KeyStroke
keyStroke)

Parameters:
keyStroke
- the
KeyStroke
for which to get the binding
Returns:
the binding for
keyStroke
remove
public
void
remove
(
KeyStroke
key)
Removes the binding for
key
from this
InputMap
.
Parameters:
key
- the
KeyStroke
for which to remove the binding
clear
public
void
clear
()
Removes all the mappings from this
InputMap
.
keys
public
KeyStroke
[]
keys
()
Returns the
KeyStroke
s that are bound in this
InputMap
.
Returns:
an array of the
KeyStroke
s that are bound in this
InputMap
size
public
int
size
()
Returns the number of
KeyStroke
bindings.
Returns:
the number of
KeyStroke
bindings
allKeys
public
KeyStroke
[]
allKeys
()
Returns an array of the
KeyStroke
s defined in this
InputMap
and its parent. This differs from
keys()
in that this method includes the keys defined in the parent.
Returns:
