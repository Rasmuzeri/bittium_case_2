Class EtchedBorder
java.lang.Object
javax.swing.border.AbstractBorder
javax.swing.border.EtchedBorder
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
,
Border
Direct Known Subclasses:
BorderUIResource.EtchedBorderUIResource
public class
EtchedBorder
extends
AbstractBorder
A class which implements a simple etched border which can
 either be etched-in or etched-out.  If no highlight/shadow
 colors are initialized when the border is created, then
 these colors will be dynamically derived from the background
 color of the component argument passed into the paintBorder()
 method.
Warning:
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 of all JavaBeans
 has been added to the
java.beans
package.
