Class IconUIResource
java.lang.Object
javax.swing.plaf.IconUIResource
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
,
Icon
,
UIResource
public class
IconUIResource
extends
Object
implements
Icon
,
UIResource
,
Serializable
An Icon wrapper class which implements UIResource.  UI
 classes which set icon properties should use this class
 to wrap any icons specified as defaults.

 This class delegates all method invocations to the
 Icon "delegate" object specified at construction.
Warning:
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 of all JavaBeans
 has been added to the
java.beans
package.
