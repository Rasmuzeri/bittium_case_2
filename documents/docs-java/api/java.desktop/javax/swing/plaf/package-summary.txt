Package javax.swing.plaf
package
javax.swing.plaf
Provides one interface and many abstract classes that Swing uses to provide
 its pluggable look-and-feel capabilities. Its classes are subclassed and
 implemented by look and feel UIs such as Basic and the Java look and feel
 (Metal). This package is only used by developers who cannot create a new
 look and feel by subclassing existing look-and-feel components (such as those
 provided by the
javax.swing.plaf.basic
and
javax.swing.plaf.metal
packages).
Note:
Most of the Swing API is
not
thread safe. For details, see
Concurrency in Swing
,
 a section in
The Java Tutorial
.
