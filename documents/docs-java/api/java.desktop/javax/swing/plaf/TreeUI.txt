Method Details
getPathBounds
public abstract
Rectangle
getPathBounds
(
JTree
tree,
TreePath
path)
Returns the Rectangle enclosing the label portion that the
 last item in path will be drawn into.  Will return null if
 any component in path is currently invalid.
Parameters:
tree
- the
JTree
for
path
path
- the
TreePath
identifying the node
Returns:
the
Rectangle
enclosing the label portion that the
         last item in path will be drawn into,
null
if any
         component in path is currently valid.
getPathForRow
public abstract
TreePath
getPathForRow
(
JTree
tree,
 int row)
Returns the path for passed in row.  If row is not visible
 null is returned.
Parameters:
tree
- a
JTree
object
row
- an integer specifying a row
Returns:
the
path
for
row
or
null
if
row
is not visible
getRowForPath
public abstract
int
getRowForPath
(
JTree
tree,
TreePath
path)
Returns the row that the last item identified in path is visible
 at.  Will return -1 if any of the elements in path are not
 currently visible.
Parameters:
tree
- the
JTree
for
path
path
- the
TreePath
object to look in
Returns:
an integer specifying the row at which the last item
         identified is visible, -1 if any of the elements in
path
are not currently visible
getRowCount
public abstract
int
getRowCount
(
JTree
tree)
Returns the number of rows that are being displayed.
Parameters:
tree
- the
JTree
for which to count rows
Returns:
an integer specifying the number of row being displayed
getClosestPathForLocation
public abstract
TreePath
getClosestPathForLocation
(
JTree
tree,
 int x,
 int y)
Returns the path to the node that is closest to x,y.  If
 there is nothing currently visible this will return null, otherwise
 it'll always return a valid path.  If you need to test if the
 returned object is exactly at x, y you should get the bounds for
 the returned path and test x, y against that.
Parameters:
tree
- a
JTree
object
x
- an integer giving the number of pixels horizontally from the
        left edge of the display area
y
- an integer giving the number of pixels vertically from the top
        of the display area, minus any top margin
Returns:
the
TreePath
node closest to
x,y
or
null
if there is nothing currently visible
isEditing
public abstract
boolean
isEditing
(
JTree
tree)
Returns true if the tree is being edited.  The item that is being
 edited can be returned by getEditingPath().
Parameters:
tree
- a
JTree
object
Returns:
true if
tree
is being edited
stopEditing
public abstract
boolean
stopEditing
(
JTree
tree)
Stops the current editing session.  This has no effect if the
 tree isn't being edited.  Returns true if the editor allows the
 editing session to stop.
Parameters:
tree
- a
JTree
object
Returns:
true if the editor allows the editing session to stop
cancelEditing
public abstract
void
cancelEditing
(
JTree
tree)
Cancels the current editing session. This has no effect if the
 tree isn't being edited.
Parameters:
tree
- a
JTree
object
startEditingAtPath
public abstract
void
startEditingAtPath
(
JTree
tree,
TreePath
path)
Selects the last item in path and tries to edit it.  Editing will
 fail if the CellEditor won't allow it for the selected item.
Parameters:
tree
- the
JTree
being edited
path
- the
TreePath
to be edited
getEditingPath
public abstract
TreePath
getEditingPath
(
JTree
tree)
Returns the path to the element that is being edited.
Parameters:
tree
- the
JTree
for which to return a path
Returns:
a
TreePath
containing the path to
tree
