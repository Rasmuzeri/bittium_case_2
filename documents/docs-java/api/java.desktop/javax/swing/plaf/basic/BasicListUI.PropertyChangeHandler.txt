Class BasicListUI.PropertyChangeHandler
java.lang.Object
javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicListUI.PropertyChangeHandler
All Implemented Interfaces:
PropertyChangeListener
,
EventListener
Enclosing class:
BasicListUI
public class
BasicListUI.PropertyChangeHandler
extends
Object
implements
PropertyChangeListener
The PropertyChangeListener that's added to the JList at
 installUI time.  When the value of a JList property that
 affects layout changes, we set a bit in updateLayoutStateNeeded.
 If the JLists model changes we additionally remove our listeners
 from the old model.  Likewise for the JList selectionModel.
Warning:
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 of all JavaBeans
 has been added to the
java.beans
package.
