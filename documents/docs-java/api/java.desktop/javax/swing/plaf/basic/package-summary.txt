Package javax.swing.plaf.basic
package
javax.swing.plaf.basic
Provides user interface objects built according to the Basic look and feel.
 The Basic look and feel provides default behavior used by many look and feel
 packages. It contains components, layout managers, events, event listeners,
 and adapters. You can subclass the classes in this package to create your own
 customized look and feel.
These classes are designed to be used while the corresponding
LookAndFeel
class has been installed
 (
UIManager.setLookAndFeel(new
XXX
LookAndFeel())
).
 Using them while a different
LookAndFeel
is installed may produce
 unexpected results, including exceptions. Additionally, changing the
LookAndFeel
maintained by the
UIManager
without updating the
 corresponding
ComponentUI
of any
JComponent
s may also produce
 unexpected results, such as the wrong colors showing up, and is generally not
 encouraged.
Note:
Most of the Swing API is
not
thread safe. For details, see
Concurrency in Swing
,
 a section in
The Java Tutorial
.
