MouseInputListener
Instantiated and used by a menu item to handle the current menu selection
 from mouse events. A MouseInputHandler processes and forwards all mouse events
 to a shared instance of the MenuSelectionManager.
This class is protected so that it can be subclassed by other look and
 feels to implement their own mouse handling behavior. All overridden
 methods should call the parent methods so that the menu selection
 is correct.
