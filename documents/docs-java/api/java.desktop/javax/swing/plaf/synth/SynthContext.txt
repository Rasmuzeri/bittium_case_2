javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthContext
public class
SynthContext
extends
Object
An immutable transient object containing contextual information about
 a
Region

 considered valid for the duration
 of the method it is passed to. In other words you should not cache
 a
SynthContext
that is passed to you and expect it to
 remain valid.
