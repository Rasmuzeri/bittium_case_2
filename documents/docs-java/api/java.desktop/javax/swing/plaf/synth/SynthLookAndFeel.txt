javax.swing.plaf.synth
Class SynthLookAndFeel
java.lang.Object
javax.swing.LookAndFeel
javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicLookAndFeel
javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthLookAndFeel
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
Direct Known Subclasses:
NimbusLookAndFeel
public class
SynthLookAndFeel
extends
BasicLookAndFeel
SynthLookAndFeel provides the basis for creating a customized look and
 feel. SynthLookAndFeel does not directly provide a look, all painting is
 delegated.
 You need to either provide a configuration file, by way of the
load(java.io.InputStream, java.lang.Class<?>)
method, or provide your own
SynthStyleFactory
to
setStyleFactory(javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthStyleFactory)
. Refer to the
package summary
for an example of
 loading a file, and
SynthStyleFactory
for
 an example of providing your own
SynthStyleFactory
to
setStyleFactory
.
SynthIcon
interface provides
paintIcon(synthContext, graphics, x, y, width, height)
method that
 allows to draw the icon with the given
SynthContext
.
Warning:
This class implements
Serializable
as a side effect of it
 extending
BasicLookAndFeel
. It is not intended to be serialized.
 An attempt to serialize it will
 result in
NotSerializableException
.

Constructor Details
SynthLookAndFeel
public
SynthLookAndFeel
()
Creates a SynthLookAndFeel.
For the returned
SynthLookAndFeel
to be useful you need to
 invoke
load
to specify the set of
SynthStyle
s, or invoke
setStyleFactory
.
See Also:
load(java.io.InputStream, java.lang.Class<?>)
setStyleFactory(javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthStyleFactory)
Method Details
setStyleFactory
public static
void
setStyleFactory
(
SynthStyleFactory
cache)
Sets the SynthStyleFactory that the UI classes provided by
 synth will use to obtain a SynthStyle.
Parameters:
cache
- SynthStyleFactory the UIs should use.
getStyleFactory
public static
SynthStyleFactory
getStyleFactory
()
Returns the current SynthStyleFactory.
Returns:
SynthStyleFactory
getStyle
public static
SynthStyle
getStyle
(
JComponent
c,
Region
region)
Gets a SynthStyle for the specified region of the specified component.
 This is not for general consumption, only custom UIs should call this
 method.
Parameters:
c
- JComponent to get the SynthStyle for
region
- Identifies the region of the specified component
Returns:
SynthStyle to use.
updateStyles
public static
void
updateStyles
(
Component
c)
Updates the style associated with
c
, and all its children.
 This is a lighter version of
SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI
.
Parameters:

getRegion
public static
Region
getRegion
(
JComponent
c)
Returns the Region for the JComponent
c

Parameters:
c
- JComponent to fetch the Region for
Returns:
Region corresponding to
c
createUI
public static
ComponentUI

ComponentUI
for

JComponent
.
Parameters:
c
- JComponent to create the
ComponentUI
for
Returns:
ComponentUI to use for
c
load
public
void

ParseException
Loads the set of
SynthStyle
s that will be used by
 this
SynthLookAndFeel
.
resourceBase
is
 used to resolve any path based resources, for example an
Image
would be resolved by
resourceBase.getResource(path)
. Refer to
Synth File Format
for more information.
Parameters:
input
- InputStream to load from
resourceBase
- used to resolve any images or other resources
Throws:
ParseException
- if there is an error in parsing
IllegalArgumentException
- if input or resourceBase is
null

Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Use
load(InputStream, Class)
or
setStyleFactory(SynthStyleFactory)
instead
Loads the set of
SynthStyle
s that will be used by
 this
SynthLookAndFeel
. Path based resources are resolved
 relatively to the specified
URL
of the style. For example
 an
Image
would be resolved by
new URL(synthFile, path)
. Refer to
Synth File Format
for more
 information.
Whilst this API may be safe for loading local resources that are
 delivered with a
LookAndFeel
or application, and so have an
 equal level of trust with application code, using it to load from
 remote resources, particularly any which may have a lower level of
 trust, is strongly discouraged.
 The alternative mechanisms to load styles from an
InputStream
load(InputStream, Class)
using resources co-located with the application or by providing a
SynthStyleFactory
to
setStyleFactory(SynthStyleFactory)
are preferred.
 Consequently this method is deprecated and will be removed in a future
 release.
Parameters:
url
- the
URL
to load the set of
SynthStyle
from
Throws:
ParseException
- if there is an error in parsing
IllegalArgumentException
- if synthSet is
null
IOException
- if synthSet cannot be opened as an
InputStream

 return value from
getStyle
off the containment hierarchy
 would override this method to return true.
