Direct Known Subclasses:

public abstract class
InternalFrameFocusTraversalPolicy
extends
FocusTraversalPolicy
A FocusTraversalPolicy which can optionally provide an algorithm for
 determining a JInternalFrame's initial Component. The initial Component is
 the first to receive focus when the JInternalFrame is first selected. By
 default, this is the same as the JInternalFrame's default Component to
 focus.

getInitialComponent
public
Component
getInitialComponent
(
JInternalFrame
frame)
Returns the Component that should receive the focus when a
 JInternalFrame is selected for the first time. Once the JInternalFrame
 has been selected by a call to
setSelected(true)
, the
 initial Component will not be used again. Instead, if the JInternalFrame
 loses and subsequently regains selection, or is made invisible or
 undisplayable and subsequently made visible and displayable, the
 JInternalFrame's most recently focused Component will become the focus
 owner. The default implementation of this method returns the
 JInternalFrame's default Component to focus.
Parameters:
frame
- the JInternalFrame whose initial Component is to be
        returned
Returns:
the Component that should receive the focus when frame is
         selected for the first time, or null if no suitable Component
         can be found
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if window is null
