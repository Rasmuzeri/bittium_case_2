Class Popup
java.lang.Object
javax.swing.Popup
public class
Popup
extends
Object
Popups are used to display a
Component
to the user, typically
 on top of all the other
Component
s in a particular containment
 hierarchy.
Popup
s have a very small life cycle. Once you
 have obtained a
Popup
, and hidden it (invoked the
hide
method), you should no longer
 invoke any methods on it. This allows the
PopupFactory
to cache
Popup
s for later use.
The general contract is that if you need to change the size of the
Component
, or location of the
Popup
, you should
 obtain a new
Popup
.
Popup
does not descend from
Component
, rather
 implementations of
Popup
are responsible for creating
 and maintaining their own
Component
s to render the
 requested
Component
to the user.
You typically do not explicitly create an instance of
Popup
,
 instead obtain one from a
PopupFactory
.

Constructor Details
Popup
protected
Popup
(
Component
owner,
Component
contents,
 int x,
 int y)
Creates a
Popup
for the Component
owner
containing the Component
contents
.
owner
is used to determine which
Window
the new
Popup
will parent the
Component
the
Popup
creates to.
 A null
owner
implies there is no valid parent.
x
and
y
specify the preferred initial location to place
 the
Popup
at. Based on screen size, or other parameters,
 the
Popup
may not display at
x
and
y
.
Parameters:
owner
- Component mouse coordinates are relative to, may be null
contents
- Contents of the Popup
x
- Initial x screen coordinate
y
- Initial y screen coordinate
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if contents is null
Popup
protected
Popup
()
Creates a
Popup
. This is provided for subclasses.
Method Details
show
public
void
show
()
Makes the
Popup
visible. If the
Popup
is
 currently visible, this has no effect.
hide
public
void
hide
()
Hides and disposes of the
Popup
. Once a
Popup
has been disposed you should no longer invoke methods on it. A
dispose
d
Popup
may be reclaimed and later used
 based on the
PopupFactory
. As such, if you invoke methods
 on a
disposed
Popup
, indeterminate
 behavior will result.
