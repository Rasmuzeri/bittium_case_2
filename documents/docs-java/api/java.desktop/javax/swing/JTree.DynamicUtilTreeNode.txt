Class JTree.DynamicUtilTreeNode
java.lang.Object
javax.swing.tree.DefaultMutableTreeNode
javax.swing.JTree.DynamicUtilTreeNode
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
,
Cloneable
,
MutableTreeNode
,
TreeNode
Enclosing class:
JTree
public static class
JTree.DynamicUtilTreeNode
extends
DefaultMutableTreeNode
DynamicUtilTreeNode
can wrap
 vectors/hashtables/arrays/strings and
 create the appropriate children tree nodes as necessary. It is
 dynamic in that it will only create the children as necessary.
Warning:
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 of all JavaBeans
 has been added to the
java.beans
package.

JTree
have children?

Constructor Details
DynamicUtilTreeNode
public
DynamicUtilTreeNode
(
Object
value,
Object
children)
Creates a node with the specified object as its value and
 with the specified children. For the node to allow children,
 the children-object must be an array of objects, a
Vector
, or a
Hashtable
-- even
 if empty. Otherwise, the node is not
 allowed to have children.
Parameters:
value
- the
Object
that is the value for the
              new node
children
- an array of
Object
s, a
Vector
, or a
Hashtable
used to create the child nodes; if any other
              object is specified, or if the value is
null
,
              then the node is not allowed to have children
Method Details
createChildren
public static
void
createChildren
(
DefaultMutableTreeNode
parent,
Object
children)
Adds to parent all the children in
children
.
 If
children
is an array or vector all of its
 elements are added is children, otherwise if
children
is a hashtable all the key/value pairs are added in the order
Enumeration
returns them.
Parameters:
parent
- the parent node
children
- the children
isLeaf
public
boolean
isLeaf
()
Returns true if this node allows children. Whether the node
 allows children depends on how it was created.
Specified by:
isLeaf
in interface
TreeNode
Overrides:
isLeaf
in class
DefaultMutableTreeNode
Returns:
true if this node allows children, false otherwise

getChildCount
public
int
getChildCount
()
Returns the number of child nodes.
Specified by:
getChildCount
in interface
TreeNode
Overrides:
getChildCount
in class
DefaultMutableTreeNode
Returns:
the number of child nodes
loadChildren
protected
void
loadChildren
()
Loads the children based on
childValue
.
 If
childValue
is a
Vector
or array each element is added as a child,
 if
childValue
is a
Hashtable
each key/value pair is added in the order that
Enumeration
returns the keys.
getChildAt
public
TreeNode
getChildAt
(int index)
Subclassed to load the children, if necessary.
Specified by:
getChildAt
in interface
TreeNode
Overrides:
getChildAt
in class
DefaultMutableTreeNode
Parameters:
index
- an index into this node's child array
Returns:
the TreeNode in this node's child array at  the specified index
children
public
Enumeration
<
TreeNode
>
children
()
Subclassed to load the children, if necessary.
Specified by:
children
in interface
TreeNode
Overrides:
