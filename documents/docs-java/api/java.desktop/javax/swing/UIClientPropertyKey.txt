UIClientPropertyKey
This interface is used only for tagging keys for client properties for
JComponent
set by UI which needs to be cleared on L&F
 change and serialization.
All such keys are removed from client properties in
JComponent.setUI()
method after uninstalling old UI and before
 installing the new one. They are also removed prior to serialization.
