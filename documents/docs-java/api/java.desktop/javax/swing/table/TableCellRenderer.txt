This interface defines the method required by any object that
 would like to be a renderer for cells in a
JTable
.

Method Details
getTableCellRendererComponent
Component
getTableCellRendererComponent
(
JTable
table,
Object
value,
 boolean isSelected,
 boolean hasFocus,
 int row,
 int column)
Returns the component used for drawing the cell.  This method is
 used to configure the renderer appropriately before drawing.
The
TableCellRenderer
is also responsible for rendering the
 the cell representing the table's current DnD drop location if
 it has one. If this renderer cares about rendering
 the DnD drop location, it should query the table directly to
 see if the given row and column represent the drop location:
JTable.DropLocation dropLocation = table.getDropLocation();
     if (dropLocation != null
             && !dropLocation.isInsertRow()
             && !dropLocation.isInsertColumn()
             && dropLocation.getRow() == row
             && dropLocation.getColumn() == column) {

         // this cell represents the current drop location
         // so render it specially, perhaps with a different color
     }
During a printing operation, this method will be called with
isSelected
and
hasFocus
values of
false
to prevent selection and focus from appearing
 in the printed output. To do other customization based on whether
 or not the table is being printed, check the return value from
JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()
.
Parameters:
table
- the
JTable
that is asking the
                          renderer to draw; can be
null
value
- the value of the cell to be rendered.  It is
                          up to the specific renderer to interpret
                          and draw the value.  For example, if
value
is the string "true", it could be rendered as a
                          string or it could be rendered as a check
                          box that is checked.
null
is a
                          valid value
isSelected
- true if the cell is to be rendered with the
                          selection highlighted; otherwise false
hasFocus
- if true, render cell appropriately.  For
                          example, put a special border on the cell, if
                          the cell can be edited, render in the color used
                          to indicate editing
row
- the row index of the cell being drawn.  When
                          drawing the header, the value of
row
is -1
column
- the column index of the cell being drawn
Returns:
the component used for drawing the cell.
