Class TabSet
java.lang.Object
javax.swing.text.TabSet
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
TabSet
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
A TabSet is comprised of many TabStops. It offers methods for locating the
 closest TabStop to a given position and finding all the potential TabStops.
 It is also immutable.
Warning:
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 of all JavaBeans
 has been added to the
java.beans
package.
