Class TabStop
java.lang.Object
javax.swing.text.TabStop
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
TabStop
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
This class encapsulates a single tab stop (basically as tab stops
 are thought of by RTF). A tab stop is at a specified distance from the
 left margin, aligns text in a specified way, and has a specified leader.
 TabStops are immutable, and usually contained in TabSets.
Warning:
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 of all JavaBeans
 has been added to the
java.beans
package.
