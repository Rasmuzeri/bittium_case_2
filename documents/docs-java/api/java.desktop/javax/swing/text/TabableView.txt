Method
Description
float
getPartialSpan
(int p0,
 int p1)
Determines the span along the same axis as tab
 expansion for a portion of the view.
float
getTabbedSpan
(float x,
TabExpander
e)
Determines the desired span when using the given
 tab expansion implementation.
Method Details
getTabbedSpan
float
getTabbedSpan
(float x,
TabExpander
e)
Determines the desired span when using the given
 tab expansion implementation.  If a container
 calls this method, it will do so prior to the
 normal layout which would call getPreferredSpan.
 A view implementing this should give the same
 result in any subsequent calls to getPreferredSpan
 along the axis of tab expansion.
Parameters:
x
- the position the view would be located
  at for the purpose of tab expansion >= 0.
e
- how to expand the tabs when encountered.
Returns:
the desired span >= 0
getPartialSpan
float
getPartialSpan
(int p0,
 int p1)
Determines the span along the same axis as tab
 expansion for a portion of the view.  This is
 intended for use by the TabExpander for cases
 where the tab expansion involves aligning the
 portion of text that doesn't have whitespace
 relative to the tab stop.  There is therefore
 an assumption that the range given does not
 contain tabs.
Parameters:
p0
- the starting location in the text document >= 0
p1
- the ending location in the text document >= p0
Returns:
the span >= 0
