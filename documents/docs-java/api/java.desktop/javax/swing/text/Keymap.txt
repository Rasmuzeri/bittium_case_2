Keymap
A collection of bindings of KeyStrokes to actions.  The
 bindings are basically name-value pairs that potentially
 resolve in a hierarchy.
Method Summary
All Methods
Instance Methods
Abstract Methods
Modifier and Type
Method
Description
void
addActionForKeyStroke
(
KeyStroke
key,
Action
a)
Adds a binding to the keymap.
Action
getAction
(
KeyStroke
key)
Fetches the action appropriate for the given symbolic
 event sequence.
Action
[]
getBoundActions
()
Fetches all of the actions defined in this keymap.
KeyStroke
[]
getBoundKeyStrokes
()
Fetches all of the keystrokes in this map that
 are bound to some action.
Action
getDefaultAction
()
Fetches the default action to fire if a
 key is typed (i.e. a KEY_TYPED KeyEvent is received)
 and there is no binding for it.
KeyStroke
[]
getKeyStrokesForAction
(
Action
a)
Fetches the keystrokes that will result in
 the given action.
String
getName
()
Fetches the name of the set of key-bindings.
Keymap
getResolveParent
()
Fetches the parent keymap used to resolve key-bindings.
boolean
isLocallyDefined
(
KeyStroke
key)
Determines if the given key sequence is locally defined.
void
removeBindings
()
Removes all bindings from the keymap.
void
removeKeyStrokeBinding
(
KeyStroke
keys)
Removes a binding from the keymap.
void
setDefaultAction
(
Action
a)
Set the default action to fire if a key is typed.
void
setResolveParent
(
Keymap
parent)
Sets the parent keymap, which will be used to
 resolve key-bindings.
Method Details
getName
String
getName
()
Fetches the name of the set of key-bindings.
Returns:
the name
getDefaultAction
Action
getDefaultAction
()
Fetches the default action to fire if a
 key is typed (i.e. a KEY_TYPED KeyEvent is received)
 and there is no binding for it.  Typically this
 would be some action that inserts text so that
 the keymap doesn't require an action for each
 possible key.
Returns:
the default action
setDefaultAction
void
setDefaultAction
(
Action
a)
Set the default action to fire if a key is typed.
Parameters:
a
- the action
getAction
Action
getAction
(
KeyStroke
key)
Fetches the action appropriate for the given symbolic
 event sequence.  This is used by JTextController to
 determine how to interpret key sequences.  If the
 binding is not resolved locally, an attempt is made
 to resolve through the parent keymap, if one is set.
Parameters:
key
- the key sequence
Returns:
the action associated with the key
  sequence if one is defined, otherwise
null
getBoundKeyStrokes
KeyStroke
[]
getBoundKeyStrokes
()
Fetches all of the keystrokes in this map that
 are bound to some action.
Returns:
the list of keystrokes
getBoundActions
Action
[]
getBoundActions
()
Fetches all of the actions defined in this keymap.
Returns:
the list of actions
getKeyStrokesForAction
KeyStroke
[]
getKeyStrokesForAction
(
Action
a)
Fetches the keystrokes that will result in
 the given action.
Parameters:
a
- the action
Returns:
the list of keystrokes
isLocallyDefined
boolean
isLocallyDefined
(
KeyStroke
key)
Determines if the given key sequence is locally defined.
Parameters:
key
- the key sequence
Returns:
true if the key sequence is locally defined else false
addActionForKeyStroke
void
addActionForKeyStroke
(
KeyStroke
key,
Action
a)
Adds a binding to the keymap.
Parameters:
key
- the key sequence
a
- the action
removeKeyStrokeBinding
void
removeKeyStrokeBinding
(
KeyStroke
keys)
Removes a binding from the keymap.
Parameters:
keys
- the key sequence
removeBindings
void
removeBindings
()
Removes all bindings from the keymap.
getResolveParent
Keymap
getResolveParent
()
Fetches the parent keymap used to resolve key-bindings.
Returns:
the keymap
setResolveParent
void
setResolveParent
(
Keymap
parent)
Sets the parent keymap, which will be used to
 resolve key-bindings.
 The behavior is unspecified if a
Keymap
has itself
 as one of its resolve parents.
Parameters:
parent
- the parent keymap
