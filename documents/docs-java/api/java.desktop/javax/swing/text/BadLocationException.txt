Class BadLocationException
java.lang.Object
java.lang.Throwable
java.lang.Exception
javax.swing.text.BadLocationException
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
BadLocationException
extends
Exception
This exception is to report bad locations within a document model
 (that is, attempts to reference a location that doesn't exist).
Warning:
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 of all JavaBeans
 has been added to the
java.beans
package.
