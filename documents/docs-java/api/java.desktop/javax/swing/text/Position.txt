Interface Position
public interface
Position
Represents a location within a document.  It is intended to abstract away
 implementation details of the document and enable specification of
 positions within the document that are capable of tracking of change as
 the document is edited.
A
Position
object points at a location between two characters.
 As the surrounding content is altered, the
Position
object
 adjusts its offset automatically to reflect the changes. If content is
 inserted or removed before the
Position
object's location, then the
Position
increments or decrements its offset, respectively,
 so as to point to the same location. If a portion of the document is removed
 that contains a
Position
's offset, then the
Position
's
 offset becomes that of the beginning of the removed region. For example, if
 a
Position
has an offset of 5 and the region 2-10 is removed, then
 the
Position
's offset becomes 2.
Position
with an offset of 0 is a special case. It never changes its
 offset while document content is altered.
