Class IconView
java.lang.Object
javax.swing.text.View
javax.swing.text.IconView
All Implemented Interfaces:
SwingConstants
public class
IconView
extends
View
Icon decorator that implements the view interface.  The
 entire element is used to represent the icon.  This acts
 as a gateway from the display-only View implementations to
 interactive lightweight icons (that is, it allows icons
 to be embedded into the View hierarchy.  The parent of the icon
 is the container that is handed out by the associated view
 factory.

Constructor Details
IconView
public
IconView
(
Element
elem)
Creates a new icon view that represents an element.
Parameters:
elem
- the element to create a view for
Method Details
paint
public
void
paint
(
Graphics
g,
Shape
a)
Paints the icon.
 The real paint behavior occurs naturally from the association
 that the icon has with its parent container (the same
 container hosting this view), so this simply allows us to
 position the icon properly relative to the view.  Since
 the coordinate system for the view is simply the parent
 containers, positioning the child icon is easy.
Specified by:
paint
in class
View
Parameters:
g
- the rendering surface to use
a
- the allocated region to render into
See Also:
View.paint(java.awt.Graphics, java.awt.Shape)
getPreferredSpan
public
float
getPreferredSpan
(int axis)
Determines the preferred span for this view along an
 axis.
Specified by:
getPreferredSpan
in class
View
Parameters:
axis
- may be either View.X_AXIS or View.Y_AXIS
Returns:
the span the view would like to be rendered into
           Typically the view is told to render into the span
           that is returned, although there is no guarantee.
           The parent may choose to resize or break the view.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- for an invalid axis
getAlignment
public
float
getAlignment
(int axis)
Determines the desired alignment for this view along an
 axis.  This is implemented to give the alignment to the
 bottom of the icon along the y axis, and the default
 along the x axis.
Overrides:
getAlignment
in class
View
Parameters:
axis
- may be either View.X_AXIS or View.Y_AXIS
Returns:
the desired alignment >= 0.0f && <= 1.0f.  This should be
   a value between 0.0 and 1.0 where 0 indicates alignment at the
   origin and 1.0 indicates alignment to the full span
   away from the origin.  An alignment of 0.5 would be the
   center of the view.
modelToView
public
Shape
modelToView
(int pos,
Shape
a,
Position.Bias
b)
throws
BadLocationException
Provides a mapping from the document model coordinate space
 to the coordinate space of the view mapped to it.
Specified by:
modelToView
in class
View
Parameters:
pos
- the position to convert >= 0
a
- the allocated region to render into
b
- the bias toward the previous character or the
  next character represented by the offset, in case the
  position is a boundary of two views;
b
will have one
  of these values:
Position.Bias.Forward
Position.Bias.Backward
Returns:
the bounding box of the given position
Throws:
BadLocationException
- if the given position does not
   represent a valid location in the associated document
See Also:
View.modelToView(int, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.Position.Bias)
viewToModel
public
int
viewToModel
(float x,
 float y,
Shape
a,
Position.Bias
[] bias)
Provides a mapping from the view coordinate space to the logical
 coordinate space of the model.
Specified by:
viewToModel
in class
View
Parameters:
x
- the X coordinate >= 0
y
- the Y coordinate >= 0
a
- the allocated region to render into
bias
- the returned bias
Returns:
the location within the model that best represents the
  given point of view >= 0
See Also:
View.viewToModel(float, float, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.Position.Bias[])
