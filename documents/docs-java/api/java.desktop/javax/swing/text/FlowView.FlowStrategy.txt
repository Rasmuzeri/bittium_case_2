Class FlowView.FlowStrategy
java.lang.Object
javax.swing.text.FlowView.FlowStrategy
Enclosing class:
FlowView
public static class
FlowView.FlowStrategy
extends
Object
Strategy for maintaining the physical form
 of the flow.  The default implementation is
 completely stateless, and recalculates the
 entire flow if the layout is invalid on the
 given FlowView.  Alternative strategies can
 be implemented by subclassing, and might
 perform incremental repair to the layout
 or alternative breaking behavior.
Since:

Method Details
insertUpdate
public
void
insertUpdate
(
FlowView
fv,
DocumentEvent
e,
Rectangle
alloc)
Gives notification that something was inserted into the document
 in a location that the given flow view is responsible for.  The
 strategy should update the appropriate changed region (which
 depends upon the strategy used for repair).
Parameters:
fv
- the flow view
e
- the change information from the associated document
alloc
- the current allocation of the view inside of the insets.
   This value will be null if the view has not yet been displayed.

View.insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)
removeUpdate
public
void
removeUpdate
(
FlowView
fv,
DocumentEvent
e,
Rectangle
alloc)
Gives notification that something was removed from the document
 in a location that the given flow view is responsible for.
Parameters:
fv
- the flow view
e
- the change information from the associated document
alloc
- the current allocation of the view inside of the insets.
See Also:
View.removeUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)
changedUpdate
public
void
changedUpdate
(
FlowView
fv,
DocumentEvent
e,
Rectangle
alloc)
Gives notification from the document that attributes were changed
 in a location that this view is responsible for.
Parameters:
fv
- the
FlowView
containing the changes
e
- the
DocumentEvent
describing the changes
               done to the Document
alloc
- Bounds of the View

View.changedUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)
getLogicalView
protected
View
getLogicalView
(
FlowView
fv)
This method gives flow strategies access to the logical
 view of the FlowView.
Parameters:
fv
- the FlowView
Returns:
the logical view of the FlowView
layout
public
void
layout
(
FlowView
fv)
Update the flow on the given FlowView.  By default, this causes
 all of the rows (child views) to be rebuilt to match the given
 constraints for each row.  This is called by a FlowView.layout
 to update the child views in the flow.
Parameters:
fv
- the view to reflow
layoutRow
protected
int
layoutRow
(
FlowView
fv,
 int rowIndex,
 int pos)
Creates a row of views that will fit within the
 layout span of the row.  This is called by the layout method.
 This is implemented to fill the row by repeatedly calling
 the createView method until the available span has been
 exhausted, a forced break was encountered, or the createView
 method returned null.  If the remaining span was exhausted,
 the adjustRow method will be called to perform adjustments
 to the row to try and make it fit into the given span.
Parameters:
fv
- the flow view
rowIndex
- the index of the row to fill in with views.  The
   row is assumed to be empty on entry.
pos
- The current position in the children of
   this views element from which to start.
Returns:
the position to start the next row
adjustRow
protected
void
adjustRow
(
FlowView
fv,
 int rowIndex,
 int desiredSpan,
 int x)
Adjusts the given row if possible to fit within the
 layout span.  By default this will try to find the
 highest break weight possible nearest the end of
 the row.  If a forced break is encountered, the
 break will be positioned there.
Parameters:
fv
- the flow view
rowIndex
- the row to adjust to the current layout
  span.
desiredSpan
- the current layout span >= 0
x
- the location r starts at.
createView
protected
View
createView
(
FlowView
fv,
 int startOffset,
 int spanLeft,
 int rowIndex)
Creates a view that can be used to represent the current piece
 of the flow.  This can be either an entire view from the
 logical view, or a fragment of the logical view.
Parameters:
fv
- the view holding the flow
startOffset
- the start location for the view being created
spanLeft
- the about of span left to fill in the row
rowIndex
- the row the view will be placed into
Returns:
a view that can be used to represent the current piece
 of the flow
