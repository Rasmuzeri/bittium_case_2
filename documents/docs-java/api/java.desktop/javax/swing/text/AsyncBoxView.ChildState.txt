Class AsyncBoxView.ChildState
java.lang.Object
javax.swing.text.AsyncBoxView.ChildState
All Implemented Interfaces:
Runnable
Enclosing class:
AsyncBoxView
public class
AsyncBoxView.ChildState
extends
Object
implements
Runnable
A record representing the layout state of a
 child view.  It is runnable as a task on another
 thread.  All access to the child view that is
 based upon a read-lock on the model should synchronize
 on this object (i.e. The layout thread and the GUI
 thread can both have a read lock on the model at the
 same time and are not protected from each other).
 Access to a child view hierarchy is serialized via
 synchronization on the ChildState instance.
Since:
1.3

Constructor Details
ChildState

ChildState
(
View
v)
Construct a child status.  This needs to start
 out as fairly large so we don't falsely begin with
 the idea that all of the children are visible.
Parameters:
v
- the view
Since:
1.4

getChildView
()
Fetch the child view this record represents.
Returns:
the child view this record represents
run
public
void
run
()
Update the child state.  This should be
 called by the thread that desires to spend
 time updating the child state (intended to
 be the layout thread).
This acquires a read lock on the associated
 document for the duration of the update to
 ensure the model is not changed while it is
 operating.  The first thing to do would be
 to see if any work actually needs to be done.
 The following could have conceivably happened
 while the state was waiting to be updated:
The child may have been removed from the
 view hierarchy.
The child may have been updated by a
 higher priority operation (i.e. the child
 may have become visible).
