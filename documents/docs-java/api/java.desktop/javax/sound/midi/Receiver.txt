Interface Receiver
All Superinterfaces:
AutoCloseable
All Known Subinterfaces:
MidiDeviceReceiver
public interface
Receiver
extends
AutoCloseable
A
Receiver
receives
MidiEvent
objects and typically does
 something useful in response, such as interpreting them to generate sound or
 raw MIDI output. Common MIDI receivers include synthesizers and MIDI Out
 ports.

Method
Description
void
close
()
Indicates that the application has finished using the receiver, and that
 limited resources it requires may be released or made available.
void
send
(
MidiMessage
message,
 long timeStamp)
Sends a MIDI message and time-stamp to this receiver.
Method Details
send
void
send
(
MidiMessage
message,
 long timeStamp)
Sends a MIDI message and time-stamp to this receiver. If time-stamping is
 not supported by this receiver, the time-stamp value should be -1.
Parameters:
message
- the MIDI message to send
timeStamp
- the time-stamp for the message, in microseconds
Throws:
IllegalStateException
- if the receiver is closed
close
void
close
()
Indicates that the application has finished using the receiver, and that
 limited resources it requires may be released or made available.
If the creation of this
Receiver
resulted in implicitly opening
 the underlying device, the device is implicitly closed by this method.
 This is true unless the device is kept open by other
Receiver
or
Transmitter
instances that opened the device implicitly, and
 unless the device has been opened explicitly. If the device this
Receiver
is retrieved from is closed explicitly by calling
MidiDevice.close
, the
Receiver
is
 closed, too. For a detailed description of open/close behaviour see the
 class description of
MidiDevice
.
Specified by:
close
in interface
AutoCloseable
