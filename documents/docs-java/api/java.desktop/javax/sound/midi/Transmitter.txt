Method
Description
void
close
()
Indicates that the application has finished using the transmitter, and
 that limited resources it requires may be released or made available.
Receiver
getReceiver
()
Obtains the current receiver to which this transmitter will deliver MIDI
 messages.
void
setReceiver
(
Receiver
receiver)
Sets the receiver to which this transmitter will deliver MIDI messages.
Method Details
setReceiver
void
setReceiver
(
Receiver
receiver)
Sets the receiver to which this transmitter will deliver MIDI messages.
 If a receiver is currently set, it is replaced with this one.
Parameters:
receiver
- the desired receiver
getReceiver
Receiver
getReceiver
()
Obtains the current receiver to which this transmitter will deliver MIDI
 messages.
Returns:
the current receiver. If no receiver is currently set, returns
null
.
close
void
close
()
Indicates that the application has finished using the transmitter, and
 that limited resources it requires may be released or made available.
If the creation of this
Transmitter
resulted in implicitly
 opening the underlying device, the device is implicitly closed by this
 method. This is true unless the device is kept open by other
Receiver
or
Transmitter
instances that opened the device
 implicitly, and unless the device has been opened explicitly. If the
 device this
Transmitter
is retrieved from is closed explicitly by
 calling
MidiDevice.close
, the
Transmitter
is closed, too. For a detailed description of
 open/close behaviour see the class description of
MidiDevice
.
Specified by:
close
