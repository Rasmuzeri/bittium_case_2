Class Patch
java.lang.Object
javax.sound.midi.Patch
public class
Patch
extends
Object
A
Patch
object represents a location, on a MIDI synthesizer, into
 which a single instrument is stored (loaded). Every
Instrument
object
 has its own
Patch
object that specifies the memory location into
 which that instrument should be loaded. The location is specified abstractly
 by a bank index and a program number (not by any scheme that directly refers
 to a specific address or offset in RAM). This is a hierarchical indexing
 scheme: MIDI provides for up to 16384 banks, each of which contains up to 128
 program locations. For example, a minimal sort of synthesizer might have only
 one bank of instruments, and only 32 instruments (programs) in that bank.
To select what instrument should play the notes on a particular MIDI channel,
 two kinds of MIDI message are used that specify a patch location: a
 bank-select command, and a program-change channel command. The Java Sound
 equivalent is the
programChange(int, int)
method of
MidiChannel
.
