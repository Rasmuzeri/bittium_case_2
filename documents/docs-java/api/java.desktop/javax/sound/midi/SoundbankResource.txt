Class SoundbankResource
java.lang.Object
javax.sound.midi.SoundbankResource
Direct Known Subclasses:
Instrument
public abstract class
SoundbankResource
extends
Object
A
SoundbankResource
represents any audio resource stored in a
Soundbank
. Common soundbank resources include:
Instruments. An instrument may be specified in a variety of ways.
   However, all soundbanks have some mechanism for defining instruments. In
   doing so, they may reference other resources stored in the soundbank.
   Each instrument has a
Patch
which specifies the MIDI program and
   bank by which it may be referenced in MIDI messages. Instrument information
   may be stored in
Instrument
objects.
Audio samples. A sample typically is a sampled audio waveform which
   contains a short sound recording whose duration is a fraction of a
   second, or at most a few seconds. These audio samples may be used by a
Synthesizer
to synthesize sound in response to MIDI commands, or
   extracted for use by an application. (The terminology reflects musicians'
   use of the word "sample" to refer collectively to a series of contiguous
   audio samples or frames, rather than to a single, instantaneous sample.)
   The data class for an audio sample will be an object that encapsulates
   the audio sample data itself and information about how to interpret it
   (the format of the audio data), such as an
AudioInputStream
.
Embedded sequences. A sound bank may contain built-in song data stored
   in a data object such as a
Sequence
.
Synthesizers that use wavetable synthesis or related techniques play back the
 audio in a sample when synthesizing notes, often when emulating the
 real-world instrument that was originally recorded. However, there is not
 necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between the
Instruments
and
 samples in a
Soundbank
. A single
Instrument
can use multiple
 SoundbankResources (typically for notes of dissimilar pitch or brightness).
 Also, more than one
Instrument
can use the same sample.

(
Soundbank
soundBank,
String
name,
Class
<?> dataClass)
Constructs a new
SoundbankResource
from the given sound bank and
 wavetable index. (Setting the
SoundbankResource's
name, sampled
 audio data, and instruments is a subclass responsibility.)
Parameters:
soundBank
- the sound bank containing this
SoundbankResource
name
- the name of the sample
dataClass
- the class used to represent the sample's data

Method Details
getSoundbank
public
Soundbank
getSoundbank
()
Obtains the sound bank that contains this
SoundbankResource
.
Returns:
the sound bank in which this
SoundbankResource
is stored
getName
public
String
getName
()
Obtains the name of the resource. This should generally be a string
 descriptive of the resource.
Returns:
the instrument's name
getDataClass
public
Class
<?>
getDataClass
()
Obtains the class used by this sample to represent its data. The object
 returned by
getData
will be of this class. If this
SoundbankResource
object does not support direct access to its
 data, returns
null
.
Returns:
the class used to represent the sample's data, or null if the
         data is not accessible
getData
public abstract
Object
getData
()
Obtains the sampled audio that is stored in this
SoundbankResource
. The type of object returned depends on the
 implementation of the concrete class, and may be queried using
getDataClass
.
Returns:
an object containing the sampled audio data
See Also:
getDataClass()
