Package javax.sound.midi
package
javax.sound.midi
Provides interfaces and classes for I/O, sequencing, and synthesis of MIDI
 (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) data.
Related Documentation
For more information on using Java Sound see:
The Java Sound Tutorial
Please note: In the
javax.sound.midi
APIs, a
null
reference
 parameter to methods is incorrect unless explicitly documented on the method
 as having a meaningful interpretation. Usage to the contrary is incorrect
 coding and may result in a run time exception either immediately or at some
 later time.
NullPointerException
is an example of typical and
 acceptable run time exception for such cases.

Description
ControllerEventListener
The
ControllerEventListener
interface should be implemented by
 classes whose instances need to be notified when a
Sequencer
has
 processed a requested type of MIDI control-change event.
Instrument
An instrument is a sound-synthesis algorithm with certain parameter settings,
 usually designed to emulate a specific real-world musical instrument or to
 achieve a specific sort of sound effect.
InvalidMidiDataException
An
InvalidMidiDataException
indicates that inappropriate MIDI data
 was encountered.
MetaEventListener
The
MetaEventListener
interface should be implemented by classes
 whose instances need to be notified when a
Sequencer
has processed a
MetaMessage
.
MetaMessage
A
MetaMessage
is a
MidiMessage
that is not meaningful to
 synthesizers, but that can be stored in a MIDI file and interpreted by a
 sequencer program.
MidiChannel
A
MidiChannel
object represents a single MIDI channel.
MidiDevice
MidiDevice
is the base interface for all MIDI devices.
MidiDevice.Info
A
MidiDevice.Info
object contains assorted data about a
MidiDevice
, including its name, the company who created it, and
 descriptive text.
MidiDeviceReceiver
MidiDeviceReceiver
is a
Receiver
which represents a MIDI
 input connector of a
MidiDevice
(see
MidiDevice.getReceiver()
).
MidiDeviceTransmitter
MidiDeviceTransmitter
is a
Transmitter
which represents a
 MIDI input connector of a
MidiDevice
(see
MidiDevice.getTransmitter()
).
MidiEvent
MIDI events contain a MIDI message and a corresponding time-stamp expressed
 in ticks, and can represent the MIDI event information stored in a MIDI file
 or a
Sequence
object.
MidiFileFormat
A
MidiFileFormat
object encapsulates a MIDI file's type, as well as
 its length and timing information.
MidiMessage
MidiMessage
is the base class for MIDI messages.
MidiSystem
The
MidiSystem
class provides access to the installed MIDI system
 resources, including devices such as synthesizers, sequencers, and MIDI input
 and output ports.
MidiUnavailableException
A
MidiUnavailableException
is thrown when a requested MIDI component
 cannot be opened or created because it is unavailable.
Patch
A
Patch
object represents a location, on a MIDI synthesizer, into
 which a single instrument is stored (loaded).
Receiver
A
Receiver
receives
MidiEvent
objects and typically does
 something useful in response, such as interpreting them to generate sound or
 raw MIDI output.
Sequence
A
Sequence
is a data structure containing musical information (often
 an entire song or composition) that can be played back by a
Sequencer
object.
Sequencer
A hardware or software device that plays back a MIDI
sequence
is known as a
sequencer
.
Sequencer.SyncMode
A
SyncMode
object represents one of the ways in which a MIDI
 sequencer's notion of time can be synchronized with a master or slave
 device.
ShortMessage
A
ShortMessage
contains a MIDI message that has at most two data
 bytes following its status byte.
Soundbank
A
Soundbank
contains a set of
Instruments
that can be loaded
 into a
Synthesizer
.
SoundbankResource
A
SoundbankResource
represents any audio resource stored in a
Soundbank
.
Synthesizer
A
Synthesizer
generates sound.
SysexMessage
A
SysexMessage
object represents a MIDI system exclusive message.
Track
A MIDI track is an independent stream of MIDI events (time-stamped MIDI data)
 that can be stored along with other tracks in a standard MIDI file.
Transmitter
A
Transmitter
sends
MidiEvent
objects to one or more
Receivers
.
VoiceStatus
A
VoiceStatus
object contains information about the current status of
 one of the voices produced by a
Synthesizer
.
