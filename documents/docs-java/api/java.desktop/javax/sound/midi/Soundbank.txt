Interface Soundbank

Soundbank
A
Soundbank
contains a set of
Instruments
that can be loaded
 into a
Synthesizer
. Note that a Java Sound
Soundbank
is
 different from a MIDI bank. MIDI permits up to 16383 banks, each containing
 up to 128 instruments (also sometimes called programs, patches, or timbres).
 However, a
Soundbank
can contain 16383 times 128 instruments, because
 the instruments within a
Soundbank
are indexed by both a MIDI program
 number and a MIDI bank number (via a
Patch
object). Thus, a
Soundbank
can be thought of as a collection of MIDI banks.
Soundbank
includes methods that return
String
objects
 containing the sound bank's name, manufacturer, version number, and
 description. The precise content and format of these strings is left to the
 implementor.
Different synthesizers use a variety of synthesis techniques. A common one is
 wavetable synthesis, in which a segment of recorded sound is played back,
 often with looping and pitch change. The Downloadable Sound (DLS) format uses
 segments of recorded sound, as does the Headspace Engine.
Soundbanks
and
Instruments
that are based on wavetable synthesis (or other uses
 of stored sound recordings) should typically implement the
getResources()
method to provide access to these recorded segments.
 This is optional, however; the method can return an zero-length array if the
 synthesis technique doesn't use sampled sound (FM synthesis and physical
 modeling are examples of such techniques), or if it does but the implementor
 chooses not to make the samples accessible.
