Uses of Package
javax.sound.midi
Packages that use
javax.sound.midi
Package
Description
javax.sound.midi
Provides interfaces and classes for I/O, sequencing, and synthesis of MIDI
 (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) data.
javax.sound.midi.spi
Supplies interfaces for service providers to implement when offering new MIDI
 devices, MIDI file readers and writers, or sound bank readers.
Classes in
javax.sound.midi
used by
javax.sound.midi
Class
Description
ControllerEventListener
The
ControllerEventListener
interface should be implemented by
 classes whose instances need to be notified when a
Sequencer
has
 processed a requested type of MIDI control-change event.
Instrument
An instrument is a sound-synthesis algorithm with certain parameter settings,
 usually designed to emulate a specific real-world musical instrument or to
 achieve a specific sort of sound effect.
InvalidMidiDataException
An
InvalidMidiDataException
indicates that inappropriate MIDI data
 was encountered.
MetaEventListener
The
MetaEventListener
interface should be implemented by classes
 whose instances need to be notified when a
Sequencer
has processed a
MetaMessage
.
MetaMessage
A
MetaMessage
is a
MidiMessage
that is not meaningful to
 synthesizers, but that can be stored in a MIDI file and interpreted by a
 sequencer program.
MidiChannel
A
MidiChannel
object represents a single MIDI channel.
MidiDevice
MidiDevice
is the base interface for all MIDI devices.
MidiDevice.Info
A
MidiDevice.Info
object contains assorted data about a
MidiDevice
, including its name, the company who created it, and
 descriptive text.
MidiEvent
MIDI events contain a MIDI message and a corresponding time-stamp expressed
 in ticks, and can represent the MIDI event information stored in a MIDI file
 or a
Sequence
object.
MidiFileFormat
A
MidiFileFormat
object encapsulates a MIDI file's type, as well as
 its length and timing information.
MidiMessage
MidiMessage
is the base class for MIDI messages.
MidiUnavailableException
A
MidiUnavailableException
is thrown when a requested MIDI component
 cannot be opened or created because it is unavailable.
Patch
A
Patch
object represents a location, on a MIDI synthesizer, into
 which a single instrument is stored (loaded).
Receiver
A
Receiver
receives
MidiEvent
objects and typically does
 something useful in response, such as interpreting them to generate sound or
 raw MIDI output.
Sequence
A
Sequence
is a data structure containing musical information (often
 an entire song or composition) that can be played back by a
Sequencer
object.
Sequencer
A hardware or software device that plays back a MIDI
sequence
is known as a
sequencer
.
Sequencer.SyncMode
A
SyncMode
object represents one of the ways in which a MIDI
 sequencer's notion of time can be synchronized with a master or slave
 device.
ShortMessage
A
ShortMessage
contains a MIDI message that has at most two data
 bytes following its status byte.
Soundbank
A
Soundbank
contains a set of
Instruments
that can be loaded
 into a
Synthesizer
.
SoundbankResource
A
SoundbankResource
represents any audio resource stored in a
Soundbank
.
Synthesizer
A
Synthesizer
generates sound.
Track
A MIDI track is an independent stream of MIDI events (time-stamped MIDI data)
 that can be stored along with other tracks in a standard MIDI file.
Transmitter
A
Transmitter
sends
MidiEvent
objects to one or more
Receivers
.
VoiceStatus
A
VoiceStatus
object contains information about the current status of
 one of the voices produced by a
Synthesizer
.

that can be loaded
 into a
Synthesizer
