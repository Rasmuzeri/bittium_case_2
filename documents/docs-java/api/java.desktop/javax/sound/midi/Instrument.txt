Class Instrument
java.lang.Object
javax.sound.midi.SoundbankResource
javax.sound.midi.Instrument
public abstract class
Instrument
extends
SoundbankResource
An instrument is a sound-synthesis algorithm with certain parameter settings,
 usually designed to emulate a specific real-world musical instrument or to
 achieve a specific sort of sound effect. Instruments are typically stored in
 collections called soundbanks. Before the instrument can be used to play
 notes, it must first be loaded onto a synthesizer, and then it must be
 selected for use on one or more channels, via a program-change command. MIDI
 notes that are subsequently received on those channels will be played using
 the sound of the selected instrument.

Class
<?> dataClass)
Constructs a new MIDI instrument from the specified
Patch
. When a
 subsequent request is made to load the instrument, the sound bank will
 search its contents for this instrument's
Patch
, and the
 instrument will be loaded into the synthesizer at the bank and program
 location indicated by the
Patch
object.
Parameters:
soundbank
- sound bank containing the instrument
patch
- the patch of this instrument
name
- the name of this instrument
dataClass
- the class used to represent the sample's data
