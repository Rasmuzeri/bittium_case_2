Class MidiFileFormat
java.lang.Object
javax.sound.midi.MidiFileFormat
public class
MidiFileFormat
extends
Object
A
MidiFileFormat
object encapsulates a MIDI file's type, as well as
 its length and timing information.
A
MidiFileFormat
object can include a set of properties. A property
 is a pair of key and value: the key is of type
String
, the associated
 property value is an arbitrary object. Properties specify additional
 informational meta data (like a author, or copyright). Properties are
 optional information, and file reader and file writer implementations are not
 required to provide or recognize properties.
The following table lists some common properties that should be used in
 implementations:
