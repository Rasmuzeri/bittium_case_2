Interface ControllerEventListener
All Superinterfaces:
EventListener
public interface
ControllerEventListener
extends
EventListener
The
ControllerEventListener
interface should be implemented by
 classes whose instances need to be notified when a
Sequencer
has
 processed a requested type of MIDI control-change event. To register a
ControllerEventListener
object to receive such notifications, invoke
 the
addControllerEventListener
method of
Sequencer
, specifying the types
 of MIDI controllers about which you are interested in getting control-change
 notifications.
