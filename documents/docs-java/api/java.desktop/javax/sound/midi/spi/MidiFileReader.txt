Class MidiFileReader
java.lang.Object
javax.sound.midi.spi.MidiFileReader
public abstract class
MidiFileReader
extends
Object
A
MidiFileReader
supplies MIDI file-reading services. Classes
 implementing this interface can parse the format information from one or more
 types of MIDI file, and can produce a
Sequence
object from files of
 these types.

getMidiFileFormat
public abstract
MidiFileFormat
getMidiFileFormat
(
InputStream
stream)
throws
InvalidMidiDataException
,
IOException
Obtains the MIDI file format of the input stream provided. The stream
 must point to valid MIDI file data. In general, MIDI file readers may
 need to read some data from the stream before determining whether they
 support it. These parsers must be able to mark the stream, read enough
 data to determine whether they support the stream, and, if not, reset the
 stream's read pointer to its original position. If the input stream does
 not support this, this method may fail with an
IOException
.
Parameters:
stream
- the input stream from which file format information should
         be extracted
Returns:
a
MidiFileFormat
object describing the MIDI file format
Throws:
InvalidMidiDataException
- if the stream does not point to valid
         MIDI file data recognized by the system
IOException
- if an I/O exception occurs
NullPointerException
- if
stream
is
null

provided. The
URL
must point to valid MIDI file data.
Parameters:

URL
from which file format information should be
         extracted
Returns:
a

object describing the MIDI file format
Throws:

- if the
URL
does not point to
         valid MIDI file data recognized by the system

getSequence
(

throws
InvalidMidiDataException
,
IOException
Obtains a MIDI sequence from the input stream provided. The stream must
 point to valid MIDI file data. In general, MIDI file readers may need to
 read some data from the stream before determining whether they support
 it. These parsers must be able to mark the stream, read enough data to
 determine whether they support the stream, and, if not, reset the
 stream's read pointer to its original position. If the input stream does
 not support this, this method may fail with an
IOException
.
Parameters:
stream
- the input stream from which the
Sequence
should be
         constructed
Returns:
a
Sequence
object based on the MIDI file data contained
         in the input stream
Throws:
InvalidMidiDataException
- if the stream does not point to valid
         MIDI file data recognized by the system
IOException
- if an I/O exception occurs
