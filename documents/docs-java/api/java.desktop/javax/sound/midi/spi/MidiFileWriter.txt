(
Sequence
sequence)
Obtains the file types that this file writer can write from the sequence
 specified.
Parameters:
sequence
- the sequence for which MIDI file type support is queried
Returns:
array of file types. If no file types are supported, returns an
         array of length 0.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
sequence
is
null
isFileTypeSupported
