Please note: In the
javax.sound.midi.spi
APIs, a
null
reference parameter to methods is incorrect unless explicitly documented on
 the method as having a meaningful interpretation. Usage to the contrary is
 incorrect coding and may result in a run time exception either immediately or
 at some later time.
NullPointerException
is an example of typical and
 acceptable run time exception for such cases.
