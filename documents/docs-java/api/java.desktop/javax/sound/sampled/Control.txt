Direct Known Subclasses:

public abstract class
Control
extends
Object
Lines
often have a set of controls, such as gain and pan, that
 affect the audio signal passing through the line. Java Sound's
Line
objects let you obtain a particular control object by passing its class as
 the argument to a
getControl
method.
Because the various types of controls have different purposes and features,
 all of their functionality is accessed from the subclasses that define each
 kind of control.
