Class AudioFileFormat
java.lang.Object
javax.sound.sampled.AudioFileFormat
public class
AudioFileFormat
extends
Object
An instance of the
AudioFileFormat
class describes an audio file,
 including the file type, the file's length in bytes, the length in sample
 frames of the audio data contained in the file, and the format of the audio
 data.
The
AudioSystem
class includes methods for determining the format of
 an audio file, obtaining an audio input stream from an audio file, and
 writing an audio file from an audio input stream.
An
AudioFileFormat
object can include a set of properties. A property
 is a pair of key and value: the key is of type
String
, the associated
 property value is an arbitrary object. Properties specify additional
 informational meta data (like a author, copyright, or file duration).
 Properties are optional information, and file reader and file writer
 implementations are not required to provide or recognize properties.
The following table lists some common properties that should be used in
 implementations:
