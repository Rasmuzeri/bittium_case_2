MASTER_GAIN
public static final
FloatControl.Type
MASTER_GAIN
Represents a control for the overall gain on a line.
Gain is a quantity in decibels (dB) that is added to the intrinsic
 decibel level of the audio signal--that is, the level of the signal
 before it is altered by the gain control. A positive gain amplifies
 (boosts) the signal's volume, and a negative gain attenuates(cuts)it.
 The gain setting defaults to a value of 0.0 dB, meaning the signal's
 loudness is unaffected. Note that gain measures dB, not amplitude.
 The relationship between a gain in decibels and the corresponding
 linear amplitude multiplier is:
linearScalar = pow(10.0, gainDB/20.0)
The
FloatControl
class has methods to impose a maximum and
 minimum allowable value for gain. However, because an audio signal
 might already be at a high amplitude, the maximum setting does not
 guarantee that the signal will be undistorted when the gain is
 applied to it (unless the maximum is zero or negative). To avoid
 numeric overflow from excessively large gain settings, a gain control
 can implement clipping, meaning that the signal's amplitude will be
 limited to the maximum value representable by its audio format,
 instead of wrapping around.
These comments apply to gain controls in general, not just master
 gain controls. A line can have more than one gain control. For
 example, a mixer (which is itself a line) might have a master gain
 control, an auxiliary return control, a reverb return control, and,
 on each of its source lines, an individual aux send and reverb send.

public static final

 may be used to affect how much of a line's signal is directed to a
 mixer's internal reverberation unit.

REVERB_RETURN
Represents a control for the post-reverb gain on a line. This control
 may be used to control the relative amplitude of the signal returned
 from an internal reverberation unit.

VOLUME
public static final
FloatControl.Type
VOLUME
Represents a control for the volume on a line.
PAN
public static final
FloatControl.Type
PAN
Represents a control for the relative pan (left-right positioning) of
 the signal. The signal may be mono; the pan setting affects how it is
 distributed by the mixer in a stereo mix. The valid range of values
 is -1.0 (left channel only) to 1.0 (right channel only). The default
 is 0.0 (centered).

BALANCE
public static final
FloatControl.Type
BALANCE
Represents a control for the relative balance of a stereo signal
 between two stereo speakers. The valid range of values is -1.0 (left
 channel only) to 1.0 (right channel only). The default is 0.0
 (centered).

SAMPLE_RATE
public static final
FloatControl.Type
SAMPLE_RATE
Represents a control that changes the sample rate of audio playback.
 The net effect of changing the sample rate depends on the
 relationship between the media's natural rate and the rate that is
 set via this control. The natural rate is the sample rate that is
 specified in the data line's
AudioFormat
object. For example,
 if the natural rate of the media is 11025 samples per second and the
 sample rate is set to 22050 samples per second, the media will play
 back at twice the normal speed.
Changing the sample rate with this control does not affect the data
 line's audio format. Also note that whenever you change a sound's
 sample rate, a change in the sound's pitch results. For example,
 doubling the sample rate has the effect of doubling the frequencies
 in the sound's spectrum, which raises the pitch by an octave.
