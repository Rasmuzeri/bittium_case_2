The
AudioPermission
class represents access rights to the audio
 system resources. An
AudioPermission
contains a target name but no
 actions list; you either have the named permission or you don't.
The target name is the name of the audio permission (see the table below).
 The names follow the hierarchical property-naming convention. Also, an
 asterisk can be used to represent all the audio permissions.
The following table lists the possible
AudioPermission
target names.
 For each name, the table provides a description of exactly what that
 permission allows, as well as a discussion of the risks of granting code the
 permission.

What the Permission Allows
Risks of Allowing this Permission
play
Audio playback through the audio device or devices on the system.
     Allows the application to obtain and manipulate lines and mixers for
     audio playback (rendering).
In some cases use of this permission may affect other
     applications because the audio from one line may be mixed with other
     audio being played on the system, or because manipulation of a mixer
     affects the audio for all lines using that mixer.
record
Audio recording through the audio device or devices on the system.
     Allows the application to obtain and manipulate lines and mixers for
     audio recording (capture).
In some cases use of this permission may affect other applications
     because manipulation of a mixer affects the audio for all lines using
     that mixer. This permission can enable an applet or application to
     eavesdrop on a user.
