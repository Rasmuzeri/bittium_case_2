Class LineEvent
java.lang.Object
java.util.EventObject
javax.sound.sampled.LineEvent
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
LineEvent
extends
EventObject
The
LineEvent
class encapsulates information that a line sends its
 listeners whenever the line opens, closes, starts, or stops. Each of these
 four state changes is represented by a corresponding type of event. A
 listener receives the event as a parameter to its
update
method. By querying the event, the
 listener can learn the type of event, the line responsible for the event, and
 how much data the line had processed when the event occurred.
Although this class implements Serializable, attempts to serialize a
LineEvent
object will fail.
Since:
1.3

Constructor Details
LineEvent
public
LineEvent
(
Line
line,
LineEvent.Type
type,
 long position)
Constructs a new event of the specified type, originating from the
 specified line.
Parameters:
line
- the source of this event
type
- the event type (
OPEN
,
CLOSE
,
START
,
         or
STOP
)
position
- the number of sample frames that the line had already
         processed when the event occurred, or
AudioSystem.NOT_SPECIFIED
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
line
is
null
Method Details
getLine
public final
Line
getLine
()
Obtains the audio line that is the source of this event.
Returns:
the line responsible for this event
getType
public final
LineEvent.Type
getType
()
Obtains the event's type.
Returns:
this event's type (
LineEvent.Type.OPEN
,
LineEvent.Type.CLOSE
,
LineEvent.Type.START
, or
LineEvent.Type.STOP
)
getFramePosition
public final
long
getFramePosition
()
Obtains the position in the line's audio data when the event occurred,
 expressed in sample frames. For example, if a source line had already
 played back 14 sample frames at the time it was paused, the pause event
 would report the line's position as 14. The next frame to be processed
 would be frame number 14 using zero-based numbering, or 15 using
 one-based numbering.
Note that this field is relevant only to certain events generated by data
 lines, such as
START
and
STOP
. For events generated by
 lines that do not count sample frames, and for any other events for which
 this value is not known, the position value should be
AudioSystem.NOT_SPECIFIED
.
Returns:
the line's position as a sample frame number
toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns a string representation of the event.
Overrides:
toString
in class
EventObject
Returns:
a string representation of the event
