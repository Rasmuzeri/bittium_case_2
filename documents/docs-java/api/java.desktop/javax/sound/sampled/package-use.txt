class describes an audio file,
 including the file type, the file's length in bytes, the length in sample
 frames of the audio data contained in the file, and the format of the audio
 data.

Type
class represents one of the standard
 types of audio file.
AudioFormat
AudioFormat
is the class that specifies a particular arrangement of
 data in a sound stream.
AudioFormat.Encoding

 length.
BooleanControl.Type
An instance of the
BooleanControl.Type
class identifies one kind
 of boolean control.
Clip

 listeners whenever the line opens, closes, starts, or stops.
LineEvent.Type
The LineEvent.Type inner class identifies what kind of event occurred on
 a line.
LineListener
Instances of classes that implement the
LineListener
interface can
 register to receive events when a line's status changes.
LineUnavailableException
A
LineUnavailableException
is an exception indicating that a line
 cannot be opened because it is unavailable.
Mixer
A mixer is an audio device with one or more lines.
Mixer.Info

Port.Info
class extends
Line.Info
with additional
 information specific to ports, including the port's name and whether it
 is a source or a target for its mixer.

DataLine
from which audio data can be
 read.
