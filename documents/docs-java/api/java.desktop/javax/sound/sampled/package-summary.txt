For more information on using Java Sound see:
The Java Sound Tutorial
Please note: In the
javax.sound.sampled
APIs, a
null
reference parameter to methods is incorrect unless explicitly documented on
 the method as having a meaningful interpretation. Usage to the contrary is
 incorrect coding and may result in a run time exception either immediately or
 at some later time.
NullPointerException
is an example of typical and
 acceptable run time exception for such cases.

Description
AudioFileFormat
An instance of the
AudioFileFormat
class describes an audio file,
 including the file type, the file's length in bytes, the length in sample
 frames of the audio data contained in the file, and the format of the audio
 data.
AudioFileFormat.Type
An instance of the
Type
class represents one of the standard
 types of audio file.
AudioFormat
AudioFormat
is the class that specifies a particular arrangement of
 data in a sound stream.
AudioFormat.Encoding
The
Encoding
class names the specific type of data representation
 used for an audio stream.
AudioInputStream
An audio input stream is an input stream with a specified audio format and
 length.
AudioPermission
The
AudioPermission
class represents access rights to the audio
 system resources.
AudioSystem
The
AudioSystem
class acts as the entry point to the sampled-audio
 system resources.
BooleanControl
A
BooleanControl
provides the ability to switch between two possible
 settings that affect a line's audio.
BooleanControl.Type
An instance of the
BooleanControl.Type
class identifies one kind
 of boolean control.
Clip
The
Clip
interface represents a special kind of data line whose audio
 data can be loaded prior to playback, instead of being streamed in real time.
CompoundControl
A
CompoundControl
, such as a graphic equalizer, provides control over
 two or more related properties, each of which is itself represented as a
Control
.
CompoundControl.Type
An instance of the
CompoundControl.Type
inner class identifies
 one kind of compound control.
Control
Lines
often have a set of controls, such as gain and pan, that
 affect the audio signal passing through the line.
Control.Type
An instance of the
Type
class represents the type of the control.
DataLine
DataLine
adds media-related functionality to its superinterface,
Line
.
DataLine.Info
Besides the class information inherited from its superclass,
DataLine.Info
provides additional information specific to data
 lines.
EnumControl
An
EnumControl
provides control over a set of discrete possible
 values, each represented by an object.
EnumControl.Type
An instance of the
EnumControl.Type
inner class identifies one
 kind of enumerated control.
FloatControl
A
FloatControl
object provides control over a range of floating-point
 values.
FloatControl.Type
An instance of the
FloatControl.Type
inner class identifies one
 kind of float control.
Line
The
Line
interface represents a mono or multi-channel audio feed.
Line.Info
A
Line.Info
object contains information about a line.
LineEvent
The
LineEvent
class encapsulates information that a line sends its
 listeners whenever the line opens, closes, starts, or stops.
LineEvent.Type
The LineEvent.Type inner class identifies what kind of event occurred on
 a line.
LineListener
Instances of classes that implement the
LineListener
interface can
 register to receive events when a line's status changes.
LineUnavailableException
A
LineUnavailableException
is an exception indicating that a line
 cannot be opened because it is unavailable.
Mixer
A mixer is an audio device with one or more lines.
Mixer.Info
The
Mixer.Info
class represents information about an audio mixer,
 including the product's name, version, and vendor, along with a textual
 description.
Port
Ports are simple lines for input or output of audio to or from audio devices.
Port.Info
The
Port.Info
class extends
Line.Info
with additional
 information specific to ports, including the port's name and whether it
 is a source or a target for its mixer.
ReverbType
The
ReverbType
class provides methods for accessing various
 reverberation settings to be applied to an audio signal.
SourceDataLine
A source data line is a data line to which data may be written.
TargetDataLine
A target data line is a type of
DataLine
from which audio data can be
 read.
UnsupportedAudioFileException
An
UnsupportedAudioFileException
is an exception indicating that an
 operation failed because a file did not contain valid data of a recognized
 file type and format.
