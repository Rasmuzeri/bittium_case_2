Class DataLine.Info
java.lang.Object
javax.sound.sampled.Line.Info
javax.sound.sampled.DataLine.Info
Enclosing interface:
DataLine
public static class
DataLine.Info
extends
Line.Info
Besides the class information inherited from its superclass,
DataLine.Info
provides additional information specific to data
 lines. This information includes:
the audio formats supported by the data line
the minimum and maximum sizes of its internal buffer
Because a
Line.Info
knows the class of the line its describes, a
DataLine.Info
object can describe
DataLine
subinterfaces
 such as
SourceDataLine
,
TargetDataLine
, and
Clip
.
 You can query a mixer for lines of any of these types, passing an
 appropriate instance of
DataLine.Info
as the argument to a method
 such as
Mixer.getLine(Line.Info)
.
Since:
1.3

Info

Class
<?> lineClass,
AudioFormat
[] formats,
 int minBufferSize,
 int maxBufferSize)
Constructs a data line's info object from the specified information,
 which includes a set of supported audio formats and a range for the
 buffer size. This constructor is typically used by mixer
 implementations when returning information about a supported line.
Parameters:
lineClass
- the class of the data line described by the info
         object
formats
- set of formats supported
minBufferSize
- minimum buffer size supported by the data line,
         in bytes
maxBufferSize
- maximum buffer size supported by the data line,
         in bytes
Info

Info

Class
<?> lineClass,
AudioFormat
format,
 int bufferSize)
Constructs a data line's info object from the specified information,
 which includes a single audio format and a desired buffer size. This
 constructor is typically used by an application to describe a desired
 line.
Parameters:
lineClass
- the class of the data line described by the info
         object
format
- desired format
bufferSize
- desired buffer size, in bytes
Info
public
Info
(
Class
<?> lineClass,
AudioFormat
format)
Constructs a data line's info object from the specified information,
 which includes a single audio format. This constructor is typically
 used by an application to describe a desired line.
Parameters:
lineClass
- the class of the data line described by the info
         object
format
- desired format
Method Details
getFormats
public
AudioFormat
[]
getFormats
()
Obtains a set of audio formats supported by the data line. Note that
isFormatSupported(AudioFormat)
might return
true
for
 certain additional formats that are missing from the set returned by
getFormats()
. The reverse is not the case:
isFormatSupported(AudioFormat)
is guaranteed to return
true
for all formats returned by
getFormats()
.
Some fields in the
AudioFormat
instances can be set to
NOT_SPECIFIED
if that field does
 not apply to the format, or if the format supports a wide range of
 values for that field. For example, a multi-channel device supporting
 up to 64 channels, could set the channel field in the
AudioFormat
instances returned by this method to
NOT_SPECIFIED
.
Returns:
a set of supported audio formats
See Also:
isFormatSupported(AudioFormat)
isFormatSupported
public
boolean
isFormatSupported
(
AudioFormat
format)
Indicates whether this data line supports a particular audio format.
 The default implementation of this method simply returns
true
if the specified format matches any of the supported formats.
Parameters:
format
- the audio format for which support is queried
Returns:
true
if the format is supported, otherwise
false
See Also:
getFormats()
AudioFormat.matches(javax.sound.sampled.AudioFormat)
getMinBufferSize
public
int
getMinBufferSize
()
Obtains the minimum buffer size supported by the data line.
Returns:
minimum buffer size in bytes, or
AudioSystem.NOT_SPECIFIED
getMaxBufferSize
public
int
getMaxBufferSize
()
Obtains the maximum buffer size supported by the data line.
Returns:
maximum buffer size in bytes, or
AudioSystem.NOT_SPECIFIED
matches
public
boolean
matches
(
Line.Info
info)
Determines whether the specified info object matches this one. To
 match, the superclass match requirements must be met. In addition,
 this object's minimum buffer size must be at least as large as that
 of the object specified, its maximum buffer size must be at most as
 large as that of the object specified, and all of its formats must
 match formats supported by the object specified.
Overrides:
matches
in class
Line.Info
Parameters:
info
- the info object which is being compared to this one
Returns:
true
if this object matches the one specified,
         otherwise
false
toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns a string representation of the info object.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Line.Info
Returns:
a string representation of the info object
