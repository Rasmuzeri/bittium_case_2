Obtains the file types for which file writing support is provided by this
 audio file writer.
Returns:
array of file types. If no file types are supported, an array of
         length 0 is returned.
isFileTypeSupported

(
AudioFileFormat.Type
fileType)
Indicates whether file writing support for the specified file type is
 provided by this audio file writer.
Parameters:
fileType
- the file type for which write capabilities are queried
Returns:
true
if the file type is supported, otherwise
false
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
fileType
is
null

stream)
Obtains the file types that this audio file writer can write from the
 audio input stream specified.
Parameters:
stream
- the audio input stream for which audio file type support
         is queried
Returns:
array of file types. If no file types are supported, an array of
         length 0 is returned.
Throws:

- file type for which write capabilities are queried
stream
- for which file writing support is queried
Returns:
true
if the file type is supported for this audio input
         stream, otherwise
false
Throws:

write
public abstract
int
write
(
AudioInputStream
stream,
AudioFileFormat.Type
fileType,
OutputStream
out)
throws
IOException
Writes a stream of bytes representing an audio file of the file type
 indicated to the output stream provided. Some file types require that the
 length be written into the file header, and cannot be written from start
 to finish unless the length is known in advance. An attempt to write such
 a file type will fail with an
IOException
if the length in the
 audio file format is
AudioSystem.NOT_SPECIFIED
.
Parameters:
stream
- the audio input stream containing audio data to be written
         to the output stream
fileType
- file type to be written to the output stream
out
- stream to which the file data should be written
Returns:
the number of bytes written to the output stream
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O exception occurs
IllegalArgumentException
- if the file type is not supported by the
         system
NullPointerException
- if
stream
or
fileType
or
out
are
null
