Class AudioFileReader
java.lang.Object
javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileReader
public abstract class
AudioFileReader
extends
Object
Provider for audio file reading services. Classes providing concrete
 implementations can parse the format information from one or more types of
 audio file, and can produce audio input streams from files of these types.

getAudioFileFormat
public abstract
AudioFileFormat
getAudioFileFormat
(
InputStream
stream)
throws
UnsupportedAudioFileException
,
IOException
Obtains the audio file format of the input stream provided. The stream
 must point to valid audio file data. In general, audio file readers may
 need to read some data from the stream before determining whether they
 support it. These parsers must be able to mark the stream, read enough
 data to determine whether they support the stream, and reset the stream's
 read pointer to its original position. If the input stream does not
 support this, this method may fail with an
IOException
.
Parameters:
stream
- the input stream from which file format information should
         be extracted
Returns:
an
AudioFileFormat
object describing the audio file
         format
Throws:
UnsupportedAudioFileException
- if the stream does not point to
         valid audio file data recognized by the system
IOException
- if an I/O exception occurs
NullPointerException
- if
stream
is
null

Parameters:
stream
- the input stream from which the
AudioInputStream
should be constructed
Returns:
an
AudioInputStream
object based on the audio file data
         contained in the input stream
Throws:
