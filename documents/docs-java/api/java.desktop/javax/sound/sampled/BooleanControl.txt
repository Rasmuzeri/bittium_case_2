Class BooleanControl
java.lang.Object
javax.sound.sampled.Control
javax.sound.sampled.BooleanControl
public abstract class
BooleanControl
extends
Control
A
BooleanControl
provides the ability to switch between two possible
 settings that affect a line's audio. The settings are boolean values
 (
true
and
false
). A graphical user interface might represent
 the control by a two-state button, an on/off switch, two mutually exclusive
 buttons, or a checkbox (among other possibilities). For example, depressing a
 button might activate a
MUTE
control to
 silence the line's audio.
As with other
Control
subclasses, a method is provided that returns
 string labels for the values, suitable for display in the user interface.

Constructs a new boolean control object with the given parameters. The
 labels for the
true
and
false
states default to "true"
 and "false".

 sets the value as indicated. Some controls require that their line be
 open before they can be affected by setting a value.
Parameters:
value
- desired new value
getValue

boolean
getValue
()
