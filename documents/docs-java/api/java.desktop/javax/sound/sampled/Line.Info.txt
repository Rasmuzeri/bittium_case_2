Direct Known Subclasses:

Enclosing interface:

public static class
Line.Info
extends
Object
A
Line.Info
object contains information about a line. The only
 information provided by
Line.Info
itself is the Java class of the
 line. A subclass of
Line.Info
adds other kinds of information
 about the line. This additional information depends on which
Line
subinterface is implemented by the kind of line that the
Line.Info
subclass describes.
A
Line.Info
can be retrieved using various methods of the
Line
,
Mixer
, and
AudioSystem
interfaces. Other
 such methods let you pass a
Line.Info
as an argument, to learn
 whether lines matching the specified configuration are available and to
 obtain them.

info)
Indicates whether the specified info object matches this one. To
 match, the specified object must be identical to or a special case of
 this one. The specified info object must be either an instance of the
 same class as this one, or an instance of a sub-type of this one. In
 addition, the attributes of the specified object must be compatible
 with the capabilities of this one. Specifically, the routing
 configuration for the specified info object must be compatible with
 that of this one. Subclasses may add other criteria to determine
 whether the two objects match.
Parameters:
