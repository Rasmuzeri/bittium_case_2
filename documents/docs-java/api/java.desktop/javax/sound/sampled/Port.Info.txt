javax.sound.sampled.Port.Info
Enclosing interface:
Port
public static class
Port.Info
extends
Line.Info
The
Port.Info
class extends
Line.Info
with additional
 information specific to ports, including the port's name and whether it
 is a source or a target for its mixer. By definition, a port acts as
 either a source or a target to its mixer, but not both. (Audio input
 ports are sources; audio output ports are targets.)
To learn what ports are available, you can retrieve port info objects
 through the
getSourceLineInfo
and
getTargetLineInfo
methods of the
Mixer
interface. Instances of the
Port.Info
class may
 also be constructed and used to obtain lines matching the parameters
 specified in the
Port.Info
object.

Class
<?> lineClass,
String
name,
 boolean isSource)
Constructs a port's info object from the information given. This
 constructor is typically used by an implementation of Java Sound to
 describe a supported line.
Parameters:
lineClass
- the class of the port described by the info object
name
- the string that names the port
isSource
-
true
if the port is a source port (such as a
         microphone),
false
if the port is a target port (such
         as a speaker)
Method Details
getName

String
getName
()
Obtains the name of the port.
Returns:
the string that names the port
isSource
public
boolean
isSource
()
Indicates whether the port is a source or a target for its mixer.
Returns:
true
if the port is a source port (such as a
         microphone),
false
if the port is a target port (such
         as a speaker)
matches
