Class AudioFormat.Encoding
java.lang.Object
javax.sound.sampled.AudioFormat.Encoding
Enclosing class:
AudioFormat
public static class
AudioFormat.Encoding
extends
Object
The
Encoding
class names the specific type of data representation
 used for an audio stream. The encoding includes aspects of the sound
 format other than the number of channels, sample rate, sample size, frame
 rate, frame size, and byte order.
One ubiquitous type of audio encoding is pulse-code modulation (PCM),
 which is simply a linear (proportional) representation of the sound
 waveform. With PCM, the number stored in each sample is proportional to
 the instantaneous amplitude of the sound pressure at that point in time.
 The numbers may be signed or unsigned integers or floats. Besides PCM,
 other encodings include mu-law and a-law, which are nonlinear mappings of
 the sound amplitude that are often used for recording speech.
You can use a predefined encoding by referring to one of the static
 objects created by this class, such as
PCM_SIGNED
or
PCM_UNSIGNED
. Service providers can create new encodings, such as
 compressed audio formats, and make these available through the
AudioSystem
class.
The
Encoding
class is static, so that all
AudioFormat
objects that have the same encoding will refer to the same object (rather
 than different instances of the same class). This allows matches to be
 made by checking that two format's encodings are equal.

toString
()
Returns encoding's name as the string representation of the encoding.
 For the predefined encodings, the name is similar to the encoding's
 variable (field) name. For example,
PCM_SIGNED.toString()
returns the name "PCM_SIGNED".
Overrides:

Returns:
a string representation of the encoding
