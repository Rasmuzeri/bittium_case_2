public interface
DataLine
extends
Line
DataLine
adds media-related functionality to its superinterface,
Line
. This functionality includes transport-control methods that
 start, stop, drain, and flush the audio data that passes through the line. A
 data line can also report the current position, volume, and audio format of
 the media. Data lines are used for output of audio by means of the
 subinterfaces
SourceDataLine
or
Clip
, which allow an
 application program to write data. Similarly, audio input is handled by the
 subinterface
TargetDataLine
, which allows data to be read.
A data line has an internal buffer in which the incoming or outgoing audio
 data is queued. The
drain()
method blocks until this internal buffer
 becomes empty, usually because all queued data has been processed. The
flush()
method discards any available queued data from the internal
 buffer.
A data line produces
START
and
STOP
events whenever it begins or ceases active
 presentation or capture of data. These events can be generated in response to
 specific requests, or as a result of less direct state changes. For example,
 if
start()
is called on an inactive data line, and data is available
 for capture or playback, a
START
event will be generated shortly,
 when data playback or capture actually begins. Or, if the flow of data to an
 active data line is constricted so that a gap occurs in the presentation of
 data, a
STOP
event is generated.
Mixers often support synchronized control of multiple data lines.
 Synchronization can be established through the
Mixer
interface's
synchronize
method. See the description of the
Mixer
interface for a more complete description.

Method Details
drain
void
drain
()
Drains queued data from the line by continuing data I/O until the data
 line's internal buffer has been emptied. This method blocks until the
 draining is complete. Because this is a blocking method, it should be
 used with care. If
drain()
is invoked on a stopped line that has
 data in its queue, the method will block until the line is running and
 the data queue becomes empty. If
drain()
is invoked by one
 thread, and another continues to fill the data queue, the operation will
 not complete. This method always returns when the data line is closed.
See Also:
flush()
flush
void
flush
()
Flushes queued data from the line. The flushed data is discarded. In some
 cases, not all queued data can be discarded. For example, a mixer can
 flush data from the buffer for a specific input line, but any unplayed
 data already in the output buffer (the result of the mix) will still be
 played. You can invoke this method after pausing a line (the normal case)
 if you want to skip the "stale" data when you restart playback or
 capture. (It is legal to flush a line that is not stopped, but doing so
 on an active line is likely to cause a discontinuity in the data,
 resulting in a perceptible click.)
See Also:
stop()
drain()
start
void
start
()
Allows a line to engage in data I/O. If invoked on a line that is already
 running, this method does nothing. Unless the data in the buffer has been
 flushed, the line resumes I/O starting with the first frame that was
 unprocessed at the time the line was stopped. When audio capture or
 playback starts, a
START
event is generated.
See Also:
stop()
isRunning()
LineEvent
stop
void
stop
()
Stops the line. A stopped line should cease I/O activity. If the line is
 open and running, however, it should retain the resources required to
 resume activity. A stopped line should retain any audio data in its
 buffer instead of discarding it, so that upon resumption the I/O can
 continue where it left off, if possible. (This doesn't guarantee that
 there will never be discontinuities beyond the current buffer, of course;
 if the stopped condition continues for too long, input or output samples
 might be dropped.) If desired, the retained data can be discarded by
 invoking the
flush
method. When audio capture or playback stops,
 a
STOP
event is generated.

isRunning()

LineEvent
isRunning
boolean
isRunning
()
Indicates whether the line is running. The default is
false
. An
 open line begins running when the first data is presented in response to
 an invocation of the
start
method, and continues until
 presentation ceases in response to a call to
stop
or because
 playback completes.
Returns:
true
if the line is running, otherwise
false
See Also:
start()
stop()
isActive
boolean
isActive
()
Indicates whether the line is engaging in active I/O (such as playback or
 capture). When an inactive line becomes active, it sends a
START
event to its listeners. Similarly,
 when an active line becomes inactive, it sends a
STOP
event.
Returns:
true
if the line is actively capturing or rendering
         sound, otherwise
false

LineListener
getFormat
AudioFormat
getFormat
()
Obtains the current format (encoding, sample rate, number of channels,
 etc.) of the data line's audio data.
If the line is not open and has never been opened, it returns the default
 format. The default format is an implementation specific audio format,
 or, if the
DataLine.Info
object, which was used to retrieve this
DataLine
, specifies at least one fully qualified audio format,
 the last one will be used as the default format. Opening the line with a
 specific audio format (e.g.
SourceDataLine.open(AudioFormat)
)
 will override the default format.
Returns:
current audio data format
See Also:
AudioFormat
getBufferSize
int
getBufferSize
()
Obtains the maximum number of bytes of data that will fit in the data
 line's internal buffer. For a source data line, this is the size of the
 buffer to which data can be written. For a target data line, it is the
 size of the buffer from which data can be read. Note that the units used
 are bytes, but will always correspond to an integral number of sample
 frames of audio data.
Returns:
the size of the buffer, in bytes
available
int
available
()
Obtains the number of bytes of data currently available to the
 application for processing in the data line's internal buffer. For a
 source data line, this is the amount of data that can be written to the
 buffer without blocking. For a target data line, this is the amount of
 data available to be read by the application. For a clip, this value is
 always 0 because the audio data is loaded into the buffer when the clip
 is opened, and persists without modification until the clip is closed.
Note that the units used are bytes, but will always correspond to an
 integral number of sample frames of audio data.
An application is guaranteed that a read or write operation of up to the
 number of bytes returned from
available()
will not block;
 however, there is no guarantee that attempts to read or write more data
 will block.
Returns:
the amount of data available, in bytes
getFramePosition
int
getFramePosition
()
Obtains the current position in the audio data, in sample frames. The
 frame position measures the number of sample frames captured by, or
 rendered from, the line since it was opened. This return value will wrap
 around after 2^31 frames. It is recommended to use
getLongFramePosition
instead.
Returns:
the number of frames already processed since the line was opened
See Also:
getLongFramePosition()
getLongFramePosition
long
getLongFramePosition
()
Obtains the current position in the audio data, in sample frames. The
 frame position measures the number of sample frames captured by, or
 rendered from, the line since it was opened.
Returns:
the number of frames already processed since the line was opened
Since:
1.5
getMicrosecondPosition
long
getMicrosecondPosition
()
Obtains the current position in the audio data, in microseconds. The
 microsecond position measures the time corresponding to the number of
 sample frames captured by, or rendered from, the line since it was
 opened. The level of precision is not guaranteed. For example, an
 implementation might calculate the microsecond position from the current
 frame position and the audio sample frame rate. The precision in
 microseconds would then be limited to the number of microseconds per
 sample frame.
Returns:
the number of microseconds of data processed since the line was
         opened
getLevel
float
getLevel
()
Obtains the current volume level for the line. This level is a measure of
 the signal's current amplitude, and should not be confused with the
 current setting of a gain control. The range is from 0.0 (silence) to 1.0
 (maximum possible amplitude for the sound waveform). The units measure
 linear amplitude, not decibels.
Returns:
the current amplitude of the signal in this line, or
AudioSystem.NOT_SPECIFIED
