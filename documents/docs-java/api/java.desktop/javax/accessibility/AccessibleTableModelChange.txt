Interface AccessibleTableModelChange
All Known Implementing Classes:
JTable.AccessibleJTable.AccessibleJTableModelChange
public interface
AccessibleTableModelChange
The
AccessibleTableModelChange
interface describes a change to the
 table model. The attributes of the model change can be obtained by the
 following methods:
public int getType();
public int getFirstRow();
public int getLastRow();
public int getFirstColumn();
public int getLastColumn();
The model change type returned by getType() will be one of:
INSERT
- one or more rows and/or columns have been inserted
UPDATE
- some of the table data has changed
DELETE
- one or more rows and/or columns have been deleted
The affected area of the table can be determined by the other four methods
 which specify ranges of rows and columns
Since:
