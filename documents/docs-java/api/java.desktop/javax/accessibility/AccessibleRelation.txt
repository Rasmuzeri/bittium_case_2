Class AccessibleRelation
java.lang.Object
javax.accessibility.AccessibleBundle
javax.accessibility.AccessibleRelation
public class
AccessibleRelation
extends
AccessibleBundle
Class
AccessibleRelation
describes a relation between the object that
 implements the
AccessibleRelation
and one or more other objects. The
 actual relations that an object has with other objects are defined as an
AccessibleRelationSet
, which is a composed set of
AccessibleRelations
.
The
AccessibleBundle.toDisplayString()
method allows you to obtain the localized
 string for a locale independent key from a predefined
ResourceBundle
for the keys defined in this class.
The constants in this class present a strongly typed enumeration of common
 object roles. If the constants in this class are not sufficient to describe
 the role of an object, a subclass should be generated from this class and it
 should provide constants in a similar manner.

 paragraph are separate text elements but are related in that the second
 element is a continuation of the first element. In other words, the first
 element "flows to" the second element.
