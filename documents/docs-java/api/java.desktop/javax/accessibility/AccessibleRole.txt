Class AccessibleRole
java.lang.Object
javax.accessibility.AccessibleBundle
javax.accessibility.AccessibleRole
public class
AccessibleRole
extends
AccessibleBundle
Class
AccessibleRole
determines the role of a component. The role of
 a component describes its generic function. (E.G., "push button," "table," or
 "list.")
The
AccessibleBundle.toDisplayString()
method allows you to obtain the localized
 string for a locale independent key from a predefined
ResourceBundle
for the keys defined in this class.
The constants in this class present a strongly typed enumeration of common
 object roles. A public constructor for this class has been purposely omitted
 and applications should use one of the constants from this class. If the
 constants in this class are not sufficient to describe the role of an object,
 a subclass should be generated from this class and it should provide
 constants in a similar manner.

AccessibleRole
(
String
key)
Creates a new
AccessibleRole
using the given locale independent
 key. This should not be a public method. Instead, it is used to create
 the constants in this file to make it a strongly typed enumeration.
 Subclasses of this class should enforce similar policy.
The key
String
should be a locale independent key for the role.
 It is not intended to be used as the actual
String
to display to
 the user. To get the localized string, use
AccessibleBundle.toDisplayString()
