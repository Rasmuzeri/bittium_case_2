Base class used to maintain a strongly typed enumeration. This is the
 superclass of
AccessibleState
and
AccessibleRole
.
The
toDisplayString()
method allows you to obtain the localized
 string for a locale independent key from a predefined
ResourceBundle
for the keys defined in this class. This localized string is intended to be
 readable by humans.
