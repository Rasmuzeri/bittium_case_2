Interface AccessibleStreamable
public interface
AccessibleStreamable
The
AccessibleStreamable
interface should be implemented by the
AccessibleContext
of any component that presents the raw stream
 behind a component on the display screen. Examples of such components are
 HTML, bitmap images and MathML. An object that implements
AccessibleStreamable
provides two things: a list of MIME types
 supported by the object and a streaming interface for each MIME type to get
 the data.
Since:
1.5
