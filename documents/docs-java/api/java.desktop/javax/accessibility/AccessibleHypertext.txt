Interface AccessibleHypertext
All Superinterfaces:
AccessibleText
All Known Implementing Classes:
JEditorPane.JEditorPaneAccessibleHypertextSupport
public interface
AccessibleHypertext
extends
AccessibleText
The
AccessibleHypertext
class is the base class for all classes that
 present hypertext information on the display. This class provides the
 standard mechanism for an assistive technology to access that text via its
 content, attributes, and spatial location. It also provides standard
 mechanisms for manipulating hyperlinks. Applications can determine if an
 object supports the
AccessibleHypertext
interface by first obtaining
 its
AccessibleContext
(see
Accessible
) and then calling the
AccessibleContext.getAccessibleText()
method of
AccessibleContext
. If the return value is a class which extends
AccessibleHypertext
, then that object supports
AccessibleHypertext
.
