Package javax.accessibility
package
javax.accessibility
Defines a contract between user-interface components and an assistive
 technology that provides access to those components. If a Java application
 fully supports the Java Accessibility API, then it should be compatible with,
 and friendly toward, assistive technologies such as screen readers, screen
 magnifiers, etc. With a Java application that fully supports the Java
 Accessibility API, no screen reader off screen model would be necessary
 because the API provides all of the information normally contained in an off
 screen model.
The Java Accessibility API package consists of 8 Java programming language
 interfaces, and 6 Java programming language classes. These are described
 below.
Interface
 Accessible
Interface Accessible
is the main interface of
 the Java Accessibility API. All components that support the Java
 Accessibility API must implement this interface. It contains a single method,
getAccessibleContext
, that returns an instance of the class
AccessibleContext
. Sun thinks that
 implementing this interface is the absolute minimum requirement of every
 object that is part of the user interface of a Java application, if that
 program is to be compatible with assistive technologies.
Class
 AccessibleContext
AccessibleContext
represents the minimum
 information all accessible objects return and is obtained by calling the
getAccessibleContext
method on an object that implements the
Accessible
interface. This information includes the
 accessible name, description,
role
, and
state
of the object, as well as information
 about the parent and children of the object.  In addition,
 JavaBeans property change support is also included to allow assistive
 technologies learn when the values of the accessible properties change.
 AccessibleContext also contains methods for obtaining more specific
 accessibility information about a component. If the component supports it,
 these methods will return an object that implements one or more of the
 following interfaces:
AccessibleAction
- the object
     can perform one or more actions. This interface provides the standard
     mechanism for an assistive technology to determine what those actions are
     and tell the object to perform those actions. Any object that can be
     manipulated should return an object that implements this interface when
     the
getAccessibleAction
method is called on an AccessibleContext.
AccessibleComponent
- the
     object has a graphical representation. This interface provides the
     standard mechanism for an assistive technology to determine and set the
     graphical representation of the object. Any object that is rendered on
     the screen should return an object that implements this interface when
     the
getAccessibleComponent
method is called on an
     AccessibleContext.
AccessibleSelection
- the
     object allows its children to be selected. This interface provides the
     standard mechanism for an assistive technology to determine the currently
     selected children as well as modify the selection set. Any object that
     has children that can be selected should return an object that implements
     this interface when the
getAccessibleSelection
method is called
     on an AccessibleContext.
AccessibleText
- the object
     presents editable textual information on the display. This interface
     provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to access
     that text via its content, attributes, and spatial location. Any object
     that contains editable text should return an object that implements this
     interface when the
getAccessibleText
method is called on an
     AccessibleContext.
AccessibleHypertext
- the
     object presents hypertext information on the display. This interface
     provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to access that
     hypertext via its content, attributes, and spatial location. Any object
     that contains hypertext should return an object that implements this
     interface when the
getAccessibleText
method is called on an
     AccessibleContext.
AccessibleValue
- the object
     supports a numerical value. This interface provides the standard
     mechanism for an assistive technology to determine and set the current
     value of the object, as well as the minimum and maximum values. Any
     object that supports a numerical value should return an object that
     implements this interface when the
getAccessibleValue
method is
     called on an AccessibleContext.
Class
 AccessibleRole
This class encapsulates the Accessible object's role in the user interface
 and is obtained by calling the
getAccessibleRole
method on an
AccessibleContext
. Accessible roles include
 "Check box", "Menu Item", "Panel", etc. These roles are identified by the
 constants in this class such as
AccessibleRole.CHECK_BOX,
 AccessibleRole.MENU_ITEM,
and
AccessibleRole.PANEL
. The constants in
 this class present a strongly typed enumeration of common object roles. A
 public constructor for this class has been purposely omitted and applications
 should use one of the constants from this class. Although this class
 pre-defines a large list of standard roles, it is extensible so additional
 programmer-defined roles can be added in the future without needing to modify
 the base class.
Class
 AccessibleState
This class encapsulates a particular state of the Accessible object.
 Accessible states include things like "Armed", "Busy", "Checked", "Focused",
 etc. These roles are identified by the constants in this class such as
AccessibleState.ARMED, AccessibleState.BUSY, AccessibleState.CHECKED,
and
AccessibleState.FOCUSED
. The sum of all the states of an
 Accessible object is called the
AccessibleStateSet
, and can be obtained by
 calling the
getAccessibleStateSet
method on an
AccessibleContext
.
The constants in this class present a strongly typed enumeration of common
 object roles. A public constructor for this class has been purposely omitted
 and applications should use one of the constants from this class. Although
 this class pre-defines a large list of standard roles, it is extensible so
 additional, programmer-defined roles can be added in the future without
 needing to modify the base class.
Class
 AccessibleStateSet
This class encapsulates a collection of states of the Accessible object and
 is obtained by calling the
getAccessibleStateSet
method on an
AccessibleContext
. Since an object might
 have multiple states (e.g. it might be both "Checked" and "Focused"), this
 class is needed to encapsulate a collection of these states. Methods in the
 class provide for retrieving the individual
AccessibleStates
on the state set.
Class
 AccessibleBundle
This class is used to maintain a strongly typed enumeration. It is the super
 class of both the
AccessibleRole
and
AccessibleState
classes. Programmers normally
 do not interact with this class directly, but will instead use the
AccessibleRole
and
AccessibleState
classes.
Interface
 AccessibleAction
The
AccessibleAction
interface should be
 supported by any object that can perform one or more actions. This interface
 provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to determine what
 those actions are as well as tell the object to perform those actions. Any
 object that can be manipulated should support this interface.
Applications can determine if an object supports the AccessibleAction
 interface by first obtaining its
AccessibleContext
(see
Accessible
) and then calling the
getAccessibleAction
method of
AccessibleContext
. If the return value is
 not
null
, the object supports this interface.
Interface AccessibleComponent
The
AccessibleComponent
interface
 should be supported by any object that is rendered on the screen. This
 interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to
 determine and set the graphical representation of an object.
Applications
 can determine if an object supports the AccessibleComponent interface by
 first obtaining its
AccessibleContext
(see
Accessible
) and then calling the
getAccessibleComponent
method of
AccessibleContext
. If the return value is
 not
null
, the object supports this interface.
Interface AccessibleSelection
The
AccessibleSelection
interface
 provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to determine what
 the current selected children are, as well as modify the selection set. Any
 object that has children that can be selected should support this the
 AccessibleSelection interface.
Applications can determine if an object supports the AccessibleSelection
 interface by first obtaining its
AccessibleContext
(see
Accessible
) and then calling the
getAccessibleSelection
method of
AccessibleContext
. If the return value is
 not
null
, the object supports this interface.
Interface
 AccessibleText
Interface
AccessibleText
is the contract
 for making rich, editable text Accessible. Not all text displayed on the
 screen is rich and editable (e.g. text contained in buttons, labels, menus,
 etc., which users aren't expected to manipulate). However, objects containing
 editable text must implement interface AccessibleText if they are to
 interoperate with assistive technologies.
This interface provides support for going between pixel coordinates and the
 text at a given pixel coordinate, for retrieving the letter, word, and
 sentence at, before, or after a given position in the text. This interface
 provides support for retrieving the attributes of the character at a given
 position in the text (font, font size, style, etc.), as well as getting the
 selected text (if any), the length of the text, and the location of the text
 caret.
Applications can determine if an object supports the AccessibleText interface
 by first obtaining its
AccessibleContext
(see
Accessible
) and then calling the
getAccessibleText
method of
AccessibleContext
. If the return value is
 not
null
, the object supports this interface.
Interface AccessibleHypertext
The
AccessibleHypertext
interface
 should be supported by any object that presents hypertext information on the
 display. This interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive
 technology to access that text via its content, attributes, and spatial
 location. It also provides standard mechanisms for manipulating
hyperlinks
. Applications can determine if
 an object supports the AccessibleHypertext interface by first obtaining its
AccessibleContext
(see
Accessible
) and then calling the
 AccessibleContext.getAccessibleText() method of
AccessibleContext
. If the return value is a
 class which extends AccessibleHypertext, then that object supports
 AccessibleHypertext.
Interface AccessibleHyperlink
An object that is a hyperlink should support the
AccessibleHyperlink
interface. 
 An object that implements this interface will be returned by calling the
 getLink method on an
AccessibleHypertext
object.
Interface
 AccessibleValue
The
AccessibleValue
interface should be
 supported by any object that supports a numerical value (e.g., a scroll bar).
 This interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to
 determine and set the numerical value as well as get the minimum and maximum
 values.
Applications can determine if an object supports the AccessibleValue
 interface by first obtaining its
AccessibleContext
(see
Accessible
) and then calling the
getAccessibleValue
method of
AccessibleContext
. If the return value is
 not
null
, the object supports this interface.
