Class AccessibilityProvider
java.lang.Object
javax.accessibility.AccessibilityProvider
public abstract class
AccessibilityProvider
extends
Object
Service Provider Interface (SPI) for Assistive Technology.
This service provider class provides mappings from the platform specific
 accessibility APIs to the Java Accessibility API.
Each service provider implementation is named and can be activated via the
activate()
method. Service providers can be loaded when the default
toolkit
is initialized.
API Note:
There will typically be one provider per platform, such as Windows
          or Linux, to support accessibility for screen readers and
          magnifiers. However, more than one service provider can be
          activated. For example, a test tool which provides visual results
          obtained by interrogating the Java Accessibility API can be
          activated along with the activation of the support for screen
          readers and screen magnifiers.
