public abstract class
Preferences
extends
Object
A node in a hierarchical collection of preference data.  This class
 allows applications to store and retrieve user and system
 preference and configuration data.  This data is stored
 persistently in an implementation-dependent backing store.  Typical
 implementations include flat files, OS-specific registries,
 directory servers and SQL databases.  The user of this class needn't
 be concerned with details of the backing store.
There are two separate trees of preference nodes, one for user
 preferences and one for system preferences.  Each user has a separate user
 preference tree, and all users in a given system share the same system
 preference tree.  The precise description of "user" and "system" will vary
 from implementation to implementation.  Typical information stored in the
 user preference tree might include font choice, color choice, or preferred
 window location and size for a particular application.  Typical information
 stored in the system preference tree might include installation
 configuration data for an application.
Nodes in a preference tree are named in a similar fashion to
 directories in a hierarchical file system.   Every node in a preference
 tree has a
node name
(which is not necessarily unique),
 a unique
absolute path name
, and a path name
relative
to each
 ancestor including itself.
The root node has a node name of the empty string ("").  Every other
 node has an arbitrary node name, specified at the time it is created.  The
 only restrictions on this name are that it cannot be the empty string, and
 it cannot contain the slash character ('/').
The root node has an absolute path name of
"/"
.  Children of
 the root node have absolute path names of
"/" +
<node
 name>
.  All other nodes have absolute path names of
<parent's
 absolute path name>
+ "/" +
<node name>
.
 Note that all absolute path names begin with the slash character.
A node
n
's path name relative to its ancestor
a
is simply the string that must be appended to
a
's absolute path name
 in order to form
n
's absolute path name, with the initial slash
 character (if present) removed.  Note that:
No relative path names begin with the slash character.
Every node's path name relative to itself is the empty string.
Every node's path name relative to its parent is its node name (except
 for the root node, which does not have a parent).
Every node's path name relative to the root is its absolute path name
 with the initial slash character removed.
Note finally that:
No path name contains multiple consecutive slash characters.
No path name with the exception of the root's absolute path name
 ends in the slash character.
Any string that conforms to these two rules is a valid path name.
All of the methods that modify preferences data are permitted to operate
 asynchronously; they may return immediately, and changes will eventually
 propagate to the persistent backing store with an implementation-dependent
 delay.  The
flush
method may be used to synchronously force
 updates to the backing store.  Normal termination of the Java Virtual
 Machine will
not
result in the loss of pending updates -- an explicit
flush
invocation is
not
required upon termination to ensure
 that pending updates are made persistent.
All of the methods that read preferences from a
Preferences
object require the invoker to provide a default value.  The default value is
 returned if no value has been previously set
or if the backing store is
 unavailable
.  The intent is to allow applications to operate, albeit
 with slightly degraded functionality, even if the backing store becomes
 unavailable.  Several methods, like
flush
, have semantics that
 prevent them from operating if the backing store is unavailable.  Ordinary
 applications should have no need to invoke any of these methods, which can
 be identified by the fact that they are declared to throw
BackingStoreException
.
The methods in this class may be invoked concurrently by multiple threads
 in a single JVM without the need for external synchronization, and the
 results will be equivalent to some serial execution.  If this class is used
 concurrently
by multiple JVMs
that store their preference data in
 the same backing store, the data store will not be corrupted, but no
 other guarantees are made concerning the consistency of the preference
 data.
This class contains an export/import facility, allowing preferences
 to be "exported" to an XML document, and XML documents representing
 preferences to be "imported" back into the system.  This facility
 may be used to back up all or part of a preference tree, and
 subsequently restore from the backup.
The XML document has the following DOCTYPE declaration:
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
Note that the system URI (http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd) is
not
accessed when exporting or importing preferences; it merely
 serves as a string to uniquely identify the DTD, which is:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    <!-- DTD for a Preferences tree. -->

    <!-- The preferences element is at the root of an XML document
         representing a Preferences tree. -->
    <!ELEMENT preferences (root)>

    <!-- The preferences element contains an optional version attribute,
          which specifies version of DTD. -->
    <!ATTLIST preferences EXTERNAL_XML_VERSION CDATA "0.0" >

    <!-- The root element has a map representing the root's preferences
         (if any), and one node for each child of the root (if any). -->
    <!ELEMENT root (map, node*) >

    <!-- Additionally, the root contains a type attribute, which
         specifies whether it's the system or user root. -->
    <!ATTLIST root
              type (system|user) #REQUIRED >

    <!-- Each node has a map representing its preferences (if any),
         and one node for each child (if any). -->
    <!ELEMENT node (map, node*) >

    <!-- Additionally, each node has a name attribute -->
    <!ATTLIST node
              name CDATA #REQUIRED >

    <!-- A map represents the preferences stored at a node (if any). -->
    <!ELEMENT map (entry*) >

    <!-- An entry represents a single preference, which is simply
          a key-value pair. -->
    <!ELEMENT entry EMPTY >
    <!ATTLIST entry
              key   CDATA #REQUIRED
              value CDATA #REQUIRED >
Every
Preferences
implementation must have an associated
PreferencesFactory
implementation.  Every Java(TM) SE implementation must provide
 some means of specifying which
PreferencesFactory
implementation
 is used to generate the root preferences nodes.  This allows the
 administrator to replace the default preferences implementation with an
 alternative implementation.
Implementation Note:
The
PreferencesFactory
implementation is located as follows:
If the system property
java.util.prefs.PreferencesFactory
is defined, then it is
 taken to be the fully-qualified name of a class implementing the
PreferencesFactory
interface.  The class is loaded and
 instantiated; if this process fails then an unspecified error is
 thrown.
If a
PreferencesFactory
implementation class file
 has been installed in a jar file that is visible to the
system class loader
,
 and that jar file contains a provider-configuration file named
java.util.prefs.PreferencesFactory
in the resource
 directory
META-INF/services
, then the first class name
 specified in that file is taken.  If more than one such jar file is
 provided, the first one found will be used.  The class is loaded
 and instantiated; if this process fails then an unspecified error
 is thrown.
Finally, if neither the above-mentioned system property nor
 an extension jar file is provided, then the system-wide default
PreferencesFactory
implementation for the underlying
 platform is loaded and instantiated.

Method Details
userNodeForPackage
public static
Preferences
userNodeForPackage
(
Class
<?> c)
Returns the preference node from the calling user's preference tree
 that is associated (by convention) with the specified class's package.
 The convention is as follows: the absolute path name of the node is the
 fully qualified package name, preceded by a slash (
'/'
), and
 with each period (
'.'
) replaced by a slash.  For example the
 absolute path name of the node associated with the class
com.acme.widget.Foo
is
/com/acme/widget
.
This convention does not apply to the unnamed package, whose
 associated preference node is
<unnamed>
.  This node
 is not intended for long term use, but for convenience in the early
 development of programs that do not yet belong to a package, and
 for "throwaway" programs.
Valuable data should not be stored
 at this node as it is shared by all programs that use it.
A class
Foo
wishing to access preferences pertaining to its
 package can obtain a preference node as follows:
static Preferences prefs = Preferences.userNodeForPackage(Foo.class);
This idiom obviates the need for using a string to describe the
 preferences node and decreases the likelihood of a run-time failure.
 (If the class name is misspelled, it will typically result in a
 compile-time error.)
Invoking this method will result in the creation of the returned
 node and its ancestors if they do not already exist.  If the returned
 node did not exist prior to this call, this node and any ancestors that
 were created by this call are not guaranteed to become permanent until
 the
flush
method is called on the returned node (or one of its
 ancestors or descendants).
Parameters:
c
- the class for whose package a user preference node is desired.
Returns:
the user preference node associated with the package of which
c
is a member.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
c
is
null
.
SecurityException
- if a security manager is present and
         it denies
RuntimePermission("preferences")
.

def)
Returns the value associated with the specified key in this preference
 node.  Returns the specified default if there is no value associated
 with the key, or the backing store is inaccessible.
Some implementations may store default values in their backing
 stores.  If there is no value associated with the specified key

 preference node.  This call has no effect on any descendants
 of this node.
If this implementation supports
stored defaults
, and this
 node in the preferences hierarchy contains any such defaults,
 the stored defaults will be "exposed" by this call, in the sense that
 they will be returned by succeeding calls to

getInt
public abstract
int
getInt
(
String
key,
 int def)
Returns the int value represented by the string associated with the
 specified key in this preference node.  The string is converted to
 an integer as by
Integer.parseInt(String)
.  Returns the
 specified default if there is no value associated with the key,
 the backing store is inaccessible, or if
Integer.parseInt(String)
would throw a
NumberFormatException
if the associated value were passed.  This
 method is intended for use in conjunction with
putInt(java.lang.String, int)
.
If the implementation supports
stored defaults
and such a
 default exists, is accessible, and could be converted to an int
 with
Integer.parseInt
, this int is returned in preference to
 the specified default.
Parameters:
key
- key whose associated value is to be returned as an int.
def
- the value to be returned in the event that this
        preference node has no value associated with
key
or the associated value cannot be interpreted as an int,
        or the backing store is inaccessible.
Returns:
the int value represented by the string associated with
key
in this preference node, or
def
if the
         associated value does not exist or cannot be interpreted as
         an int.
Throws:
IllegalStateException
- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
         removed with the
removeNode()
method.
NullPointerException
- if
key
is

 character
('/')
) are interpreted relative to this preference
 node.
If this node (or an ancestor) has already been removed with the

is
legal to invoke this method,
 but only with the path name

 removed, attempting any method other than
name()

isUserNode()
,
flush()

The removal is not guaranteed to be persistent until the
flush
method is called on this node (or an ancestor).
If this implementation supports
stored defaults
, removing a
 node exposes any stored defaults at or below this node.  Thus, a
 subsequent call to

BackingStoreException
Forces any changes in the contents of this preference node and its
 descendants to the persistent store.  Once this method returns
 successfully, it is safe to assume that all changes made in the
 subtree rooted at this node prior to the method invocation have become
 permanent.
Implementations are free to flush changes into the persistent store
 at any time.  They do not need to wait for this method to be called.
When a flush occurs on a newly created node, it is made persistent,
 as are any ancestors (and descendants) that have yet to be made
 persistent.  Note however that any preference value changes in
 ancestors are
not
guaranteed to be made persistent.
If this method is invoked on a node that has been removed with
 the
removeNode()
method, flushSpi() is invoked on this node,
 but not on others.
Throws:
BackingStoreException

addPreferenceChangeListener
public abstract
void
addPreferenceChangeListener
(
PreferenceChangeListener
pcl)
Registers the specified listener to receive
preference change
 events
for this preference node.  A preference change event is
 generated when a preference is added to this node, removed from this
 node, or when the value associated with a preference is changed.
 (Preference change events are
not
generated by the
removeNode()
method, which generates a
node change event
.
 Preference change events
are
generated by the
clear
method.)
Events are only guaranteed for changes made within the same JVM
 as the registered listener, though some implementations may generate
 events for changes made outside this JVM.  Events may be generated
 before the changes have been made persistent.  Events are not generated
 when preferences are modified in descendants of this node; a caller
 desiring such events must register with each descendant.
Parameters:
pcl
- The preference change listener to add.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
pcl
is null.
IllegalStateException
- if this node (or an ancestor) has been

addNodeChangeListener
public abstract
void
addNodeChangeListener
(
NodeChangeListener
ncl)
Registers the specified listener to receive
node change events
for this node.  A node change event is generated when a child node is
 added to or removed from this node.  (A single
removeNode()
invocation results in multiple
node change events
, one for every
 node in the subtree rooted at the removed node.)
Events are only guaranteed for changes made within the same JVM
 as the registered listener, though some implementations may generate
 events for changes made outside this JVM.  Events may be generated
 before the changes have become permanent.  Events are not generated
 when indirect descendants of this node are added or removed; a
 caller desiring such events must register with each descendant.
Few guarantees can be made regarding node creation.  Because nodes
 are created implicitly upon access, it may not be feasible for an
 implementation to determine whether a child node existed in the backing
 store prior to access (for example, because the backing store is
 unreachable or cached information is out of date).  Under these
 circumstances, implementations are neither required to generate node
 change events nor prohibited from doing so.
Parameters:
ncl
- The
NodeChangeListener
to add.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
ncl
is null.
IllegalStateException
- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
         removed with the
removeNode()
method.

ncl)
Removes the specified
NodeChangeListener
, so it no longer
 receives change events.
Parameters:
ncl
- The
NodeChangeListener
to remove.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
ncl
was not a registered
NodeChangeListener
on this node.
IllegalStateException
- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
         removed with the
removeNode()
method.

BackingStoreException
Emits on the specified output stream an XML document representing all
 of the preferences contained in this node (but not its descendants).
 This XML document is, in effect, an offline backup of the node.
The XML document will have the following DOCTYPE declaration:
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
The UTF-8 character encoding will be used.
This method is an exception to the general rule that the results of
 concurrently executing multiple methods in this class yields
 results equivalent to some serial execution.  If the preferences
 at this node are modified concurrently with an invocation of this
 method, the exported preferences comprise a "fuzzy snapshot" of the
 preferences contained in the node; some of the concurrent modifications
 may be reflected in the exported data while others may not.
Parameters:
os
- the output stream on which to emit the XML document.
Throws:
IOException
- if writing to the specified output stream
         results in an
IOException
.
BackingStoreException
- if preference data cannot be read from
         backing store.
IllegalStateException
- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
         removed with the
removeNode()
method.

BackingStoreException
Emits an XML document representing all of the preferences contained
 in this node and all of its descendants.  This XML document is, in
 effect, an offline backup of the subtree rooted at the node.
The XML document will have the following DOCTYPE declaration:
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
The UTF-8 character encoding will be used.
This method is an exception to the general rule that the results of
 concurrently executing multiple methods in this class yields
 results equivalent to some serial execution.  If the preferences
 or nodes in the subtree rooted at this node are modified concurrently
 with an invocation of this method, the exported preferences comprise a
 "fuzzy snapshot" of the subtree; some of the concurrent modifications
 may be reflected in the exported data while others may not.
Parameters:
os
- the output stream on which to emit the XML document.
Throws:
IOException
- if writing to the specified output stream
         results in an
IOException
.
BackingStoreException
- if preference data cannot be read from
         backing store.
IllegalStateException
- if this node (or an ancestor) has been
         removed with the
removeNode()
method.

InvalidPreferencesFormatException
Imports all of the preferences represented by the XML document on the
 specified input stream.  The document may represent user preferences or
 system preferences.  If it represents user preferences, the preferences
 will be imported into the calling user's preference tree (even if they
 originally came from a different user's preference tree).  If any of
 the preferences described by the document inhabit preference nodes that
 do not exist, the nodes will be created.
The XML document must have the following DOCTYPE declaration:
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
(This method is designed for use in conjunction with
exportNode(OutputStream)
and
exportSubtree(OutputStream)
.
This method is an exception to the general rule that the results of
 concurrently executing multiple methods in this class yields
 results equivalent to some serial execution.  The method behaves
 as if implemented on top of the other public methods in this class,
 notably
node(String)
and
put(String, String)
.
Parameters:
is
- the input stream from which to read the XML document.
Throws:
IOException
- if reading from the specified input stream
         results in an
IOException
.
InvalidPreferencesFormatException
- Data on input stream does not
         constitute a valid XML document with the mandated document type.
SecurityException
- If a security manager is present and
         it denies
RuntimePermission("preferences")
.
