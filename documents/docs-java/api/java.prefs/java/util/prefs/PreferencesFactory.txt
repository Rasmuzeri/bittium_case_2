PreferencesFactory
A factory object that generates Preferences objects.  Providers of
 new
Preferences
implementations should provide corresponding
PreferencesFactory
implementations so that the new
Preferences
implementation can be installed in place of the
 platform-specific default implementation.
This class is for
Preferences
implementers only.
 Normal users of the
Preferences
facility should have no need to
 consult this documentation.
