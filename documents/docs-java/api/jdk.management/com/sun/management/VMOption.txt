Class VMOption
java.lang.Object
com.sun.management.VMOption
public class
VMOption
extends
Object
Information about a VM option including its value and
 where the value came from which is referred as its
origin
.
Each VM option has a default value.  A VM option can
 be set at VM creation time typically as a command line
 argument to the launcher or an argument passed to the
 VM created using the JNI invocation interface.
 In addition, a VM option may be set via an environment
 variable or a configuration file. A VM option can also
 be set dynamically via a management interface after
 the VM was started.

 A
VMOption
contains the value of a VM option
 and the origin of that value at the time this
VMOption
object was constructed.  The value of the VM option
 may be changed after the
VMOption
object was constructed,
