Class AbstractNotificationHandler<T>
java.lang.Object
com.sun.nio.sctp.AbstractNotificationHandler<T>
All Implemented Interfaces:
NotificationHandler
<T>
public class
AbstractNotificationHandler<T>
extends
Object
implements
NotificationHandler
<T>
A skeletal handler that consumes notifications and continues.
This class trivially implements the
handleNotification
methods to
 return
CONTINUE
so that all notifications are
 consumed and the channel continues to try and receive a message.
It also provides overloaded versions of the
handleNotification
methods, one for each of the required supported notification types,
AssociationChangeNotification
,
PeerAddressChangeNotification
,
SendFailedNotification
, and
ShutdownNotification
. The
 appropriate method will be invoked when the notification is received.
Since:
1.7
