Class Association

com.sun.nio.sctp.Association
public class
Association
extends
Object
A class that represents an SCTP association.
An association exists between two SCTP endpoints. Each endpoint is
 represented by a list of transport addresses through which that endpoint can
 be reached and from which it will originate SCTP messages. The association
 spans over all of the possible source/destination combinations which may be
 generated from each endpoint's lists of addresses.
Associations are identified by their Association ID.
 Association ID's are guaranteed to be unique for the lifetime of the
 association. An association ID may be reused after the association has been
 shutdown. An association ID is not unique across multiple SCTP channels.
 An Association's local and remote addresses may change if the SCTP
 implementation supports
Dynamic Address Reconfiguration
as defined by
RFC5061
, see the
bindAddress
and
unbindAddress
methods of
SctpChannel
,
SctpServerChannel
, and
SctpMultiChannel
.
An
Association
is returned from an
SctpChannel
or an
SctpMultiChannel
, as well
 as being given as a parameter to
NotificationHandler
methods.
