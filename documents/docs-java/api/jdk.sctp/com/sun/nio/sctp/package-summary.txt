A Java API for Stream Control Transport Protocol.
The Stream Control Transport Protocol (SCTP) is a reliable,
 message-oriented, transport protocol existing at an equivalent level with UDP
 (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). SCTP is
 session oriented and an association between the endpoints must be established
 before any data can be transmitted.
SCTP has direct support for multi-homing, meaning than an endpoint may be
 represented by more than one address and each address may be used for sending
 and receiving data, thus providing network redundancy. The connection between
 two endpoints is referred to as an association between those endpoints.
 Endpoints can exchange a list of addresses during association setup. One
 address is designated as the primary address, this is the default address that
 the peer will use for sending data. A single port number is used across the
 entire address list at an endpoint for a specific session.
SCTP is message based. I/O operations operate upon messages and message
 boundaries are preserved. Each association may support multiple independent
 logical streams. Each stream represents a sequence of messages within a single
 association and streams are independent of one another, meaning that stream
 identifiers and sequence numbers are included in the data packet to allow
 sequencing of messages on a per-stream basis.
This package provides two programming model styles. The one-to-one style
 supported by
SctpChannel
and
SctpServerChannel
, and the one-to-many
 style supported by
SctpMultiChannel
.
 The semantics of the one-to-one style interface are very similar to TCP.
 An
SctpChannel
can only control one SCTP association. The
 semantics of the one-to-many style interface are very similar to UDP. An
SctpMutliChannel
can control multiple SCTP associations.
Applications can send and receive per-message ancillary information through
MessageInfo
. For example, the stream number that
 the message it is to be sent or received from. The SCTP stack is event driven
 and applications can receive notifications of certain SCTP events by invoking
 the
receive
method of the SCTP channel with an appropriate
notification handler
.
The SCTP protocol is defined by
RFC4960
, and the optional
 extension for
Dynamic Address Reconfiguration
is defined by
RFC5061
.

Description
AbstractNotificationHandler
<T>
A skeletal handler that consumes notifications and continues.
Association
A class that represents an SCTP association.
AssociationChangeNotification
Notification emitted when an association has either opened or closed.
AssociationChangeNotification.AssocChangeEvent
Defines the type of change event that happened to the association.
HandlerResult
Defines notification handler results.
IllegalReceiveException
Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to invoke the
receive
method of
SctpChannel
or
SctpMultiChannel
from a notification handler.
IllegalUnbindException
Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to remove an
 address that is not bound to the channel, or remove an address from a
 channel that has only one address bound to it.
InvalidStreamException
Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to send a
 message to an invalid stream.
MessageInfo
The
MessageInfo
class provides additional ancillary information about
 messages.
Notification
A notification from the SCTP stack.
NotificationHandler
<T>
A handler for consuming notifications from the SCTP stack.
PeerAddressChangeNotification
Notification emitted when a destination address on a multi-homed peer
 encounters a change.
PeerAddressChangeNotification.AddressChangeEvent
Defines the type of address change event that occurred to the destination
 address on a multi-homed peer when it encounters a change of interface
 details.
SctpChannel
A selectable channel for message-oriented connected SCTP sockets.
SctpMultiChannel
A selectable channel for message-oriented SCTP sockets.
SctpServerChannel
A selectable channel for message-oriented listening SCTP sockets.
SctpSocketOption
<T>
A socket option associated with an SCTP channel.
SctpStandardSocketOptions
SCTP channels supports the socket options defined by this class
 (as well as those listed in the particular channel class) and may support
 additional Implementation specific socket options.
SctpStandardSocketOptions.InitMaxStreams
This class is used to set the maximum number of inbound/outbound streams
 used by the local endpoint during association initialization.
SendFailedNotification
Notification emitted when a send failed notification has been received.
ShutdownNotification
Notification emitted when a peer shuts down an association.
