Interface NotificationHandler<T>
Type Parameters:
T
- The type of the object attached to the receive operation
All Known Implementing Classes:
AbstractNotificationHandler
public interface
NotificationHandler<T>
A handler for consuming notifications from the SCTP stack.
The SCTP channels defined in this package allow a notification handler to
 be specified to consume notifications from the SCTP stack. When a
 notification is received the
handleNotification
method of the handler is invoked to handle that
 notification.
Additionally, an attachment object can be attached to the
receive
operation to provide context when consuming the notification. The
 attachment is important for cases where a
state-less
NotificationHandler
is used to consume the result of many
receive
operations.
Handler implementations are encouraged to extend the
AbstractNotificationHandler
class which implements this interface and
 provide notification specific methods. However, an API should generally use
 this handler interface as the type for parameters, return type, etc. rather
 than the abstract class.
