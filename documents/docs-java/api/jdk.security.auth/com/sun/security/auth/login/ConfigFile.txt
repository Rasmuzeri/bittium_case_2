com.sun.security.auth.login
Class ConfigFile
java.lang.Object
javax.security.auth.login.Configuration
com.sun.security.auth.login.ConfigFile
public class
ConfigFile
extends
Configuration
This class represents a default implementation for
javax.security.auth.login.Configuration
.
This object stores the runtime login configuration representation,
 and is the amalgamation of multiple static login
 configurations that resides in files.
 The algorithm for locating the login configuration file(s) and reading their
 information into this
Configuration
object is:
Loop through the security properties,
login.config.url.1
,
login.config.url.2
, ...,
login.config.url.X
.
   Each property value specifies a
URL
pointing to a
   login configuration file to be loaded.  Read in and load
   each configuration.
The system property
java.security.auth.login.config
may also be set to a
URL
pointing to another
   login configuration file
   (which is the case when a user uses the -D switch at runtime).
   If this property is defined, and its use is allowed by the
   security property file (the Security property,
policy.allowSystemProperty
is set to
true
),
   also load that login configuration.
If the
java.security.auth.login.config
property is defined using
   "==" (rather than "="), then ignore all other specified
   login configurations and only load this configuration.
If no system or security properties were set, try to read from the file,
   ${user.home}/.java.login.config, where ${user.home} is the value
   represented by the "user.home" System property.
The configuration syntax supported by this implementation
 is exactly that syntax specified in the
javax.security.auth.login.Configuration
class. In addition, the
 security property
policy.expandProperties
can be used to control
 whether system properties in the configuration file are expanded. If not
 set, the default value is
true
which means that properties will
 be expanded.
