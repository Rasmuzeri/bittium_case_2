Class KeyStoreLoginModule
java.lang.Object
com.sun.security.auth.module.KeyStoreLoginModule
All Implemented Interfaces:
LoginModule
public class
KeyStoreLoginModule
extends
Object
implements
LoginModule
Provides a JAAS login module that prompts for a key store alias and
 populates the subject with the alias's principal and credentials. Stores
 an
X500Principal
for the subject distinguished name of the
 first certificate in the alias's credentials in the subject's principals,
 the alias's certificate path in the subject's public credentials, and a
X500PrivateCredential
whose certificate is the first
 certificate in the alias's certificate path and whose private key is the
 alias's private key in the subject's private credentials.
Recognizes the following options in the configuration file:
keyStoreURL
A URL that specifies the location of the key store.  Defaults to
      a URL pointing to the .keystore file in the directory specified by the
user.home
system property.  The input stream from this
      URL is passed to the
KeyStore.load
method.
      "NONE" may be specified if a
null
stream must be
      passed to the
KeyStore.load
method.
      "NONE" should be specified if the KeyStore resides
      on a hardware token device, for example.
keyStoreType
The key store type.  If not specified, defaults to the result of
      calling
KeyStore.getDefaultType()
.
      If the type is "PKCS11", then keyStoreURL must be "NONE"
      and privateKeyPasswordURL must not be specified.
keyStoreProvider
The key store provider.  If not specified, uses the standard search
      order to find the provider.
keyStoreAlias
The alias in the key store to login as.  Required when no callback
      handler is provided.  No default value.
keyStorePasswordURL
A URL that specifies the location of the key store password.  Required
      when no callback handler is provided and
protected
is false.
      No default value.
privateKeyPasswordURL
A URL that specifies the location of the specific private key password
      needed to access the private key for this alias.
      The keystore password
      is used if this value is needed and not specified.
protected
This value should be set to "true" if the KeyStore
      has a separate, protected authentication path
      (for example, a dedicated PIN-pad attached to a smart card).
      Defaults to "false". If "true" keyStorePasswordURL and
      privateKeyPasswordURL must not be specified.

CallbackHandler
for communicating
                  with the end user (prompting for usernames and

boolean
login
()
              throws
LoginException
Authenticate the user.
Get the Keystore alias and relevant passwords.
 Retrieve the alias's principal and credentials from the Keystore.
Specified by:
login
in interface
LoginModule
Returns:
true in all cases (this
LoginModule
should not be ignored).
Throws:
FailedLoginException
- if the authentication fails.
LoginException
- if the authentication fails
commit
public
boolean
commit
()
               throws
LoginException
Abstract method to commit the authentication process (phase 2).
This method is called if the LoginContext's
 overall authentication succeeded
 (the relevant REQUIRED, REQUISITE, SUFFICIENT and OPTIONAL LoginModules
 succeeded).
If this LoginModule's own authentication attempt
 succeeded (checked by retrieving the private state saved by the
login
method), then this method associates a
X500Principal
for the subject distinguished name of the
 first certificate in the alias's credentials in the subject's
 principals, the alias's certificate path in the subject's public
 credentials, and a
X500PrivateCredential
whose certificate
 is the first  certificate in the alias's certificate path and whose
 private key is the alias's private key in the subject's private
 credentials.  If this LoginModule's own
 authentication attempted failed, then this method removes
 any state that was originally saved.
Specified by:
commit
in interface
LoginModule
Returns:
true if this LoginModule's own login and commit
          attempts succeeded, or false otherwise.
Throws:
LoginException
- if the commit fails
abort
public
boolean
abort
()
              throws
LoginException
This method is called if the LoginContext's
 overall authentication failed.
 (the relevant REQUIRED, REQUISITE, SUFFICIENT and OPTIONAL LoginModules
 did not succeed).
If this LoginModule's own authentication attempt
 succeeded (checked by retrieving the private state saved by the
login
and
commit
methods),
 then this method cleans up any state that was originally saved.
If the loaded KeyStore's provider extends
java.security.AuthProvider
,
 then the provider's
logout
method is invoked.
Specified by:
abort
in interface
LoginModule
Returns:
false if this LoginModule's own login and/or commit attempts
          failed, and true otherwise.
Throws:
LoginException
- if the abort fails.
logout
public
boolean
logout
()
               throws
LoginException
Logout a user.
This method removes the Principals, public credentials and the
 private credentials that were added by the
commit
method.
If the loaded KeyStore's provider extends
java.security.AuthProvider
,
 then the provider's
logout
method is invoked.
Specified by:
logout
in interface
LoginModule
Returns:
true in all cases since this
LoginModule
should not be ignored.
Throws:
LoginException
- if the logout fails.
