Package

Class NTSidDomainPrincipal
java.lang.Object
com.sun.security.auth.NTSid
com.sun.security.auth.NTSidDomainPrincipal
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
,
Principal
public class
NTSidDomainPrincipal
extends
NTSid
This class extends
NTSid
and represents a Windows NT user's domain SID.
An NT user only has a domain SID if in fact they are logged
 into an NT domain.  If the user is logged into a workgroup or
 just a standalone configuration, they will NOT have a domain SID.
Principals such as this
NTSidDomainPrincipal
may be associated with a particular
Subject
to augment that
Subject
with an additional
 identity.  Refer to the
Subject
class for more information
 on how to achieve this.  Authorization decisions can then be based upon
 the Principals associated with a
Subject
.
