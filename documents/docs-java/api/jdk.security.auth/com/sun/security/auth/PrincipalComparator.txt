Interface PrincipalComparator
public interface
PrincipalComparator
An object that implements the
java.security.Principal
interface typically also implements this interface to provide
 a means for comparing that object to a specified
Subject
.
The comparison is achieved via the
implies
method.
 The implementation of the
implies
method determines
 whether this object "implies" the specified
Subject
.
 One example application of this method may be for
 a "group" object to imply a particular
Subject
if that
Subject
belongs to the group.
 Another example application of this method would be for
 "role" object to imply a particular
Subject
if that
Subject
is currently acting in that role.
Although classes that implement this interface typically
 also implement the
java.security.Principal
interface,
 it is not required.  In other words, classes may implement the
java.security.Principal
interface by itself,
 the
PrincipalComparator
interface by itself,
 or both at the same time.
