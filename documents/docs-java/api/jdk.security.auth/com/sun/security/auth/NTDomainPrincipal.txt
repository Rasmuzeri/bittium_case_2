public class
NTDomainPrincipal
extends

This class implements the
Principal
interface
 and represents the name of the Windows NT domain into which the
 user authenticated.  This will be a domain name if the user logged
 into a Windows NT domain, a workgroup name if the user logged into
 a workgroup, or a machine name if the user logged into a standalone
 configuration.
Principals such as this
NTDomainPrincipal
may be associated with a particular
Subject
to augment that
Subject
with an additional
 identity.  Refer to the
Subject
class for more information
 on how to achieve this.  Authorization decisions can then be based upon
 the Principals associated with a
Subject
.
