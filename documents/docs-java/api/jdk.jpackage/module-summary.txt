jdk.jpackage
Defines the Java Packaging tool, jpackage.
jpackage is a tool for generating self-contained application bundles.
This module provides the equivalent of command-line access to
jpackage
via the
ToolProvider
SPI.
 Instances of the tool can be obtained by calling
ToolProvider.findFirst
or the
service loader
with the name
"jpackage"
.
Implementation Note:
The
jpackage
tool is not thread-safe. An application
 should not call either of the
ToolProvider
run
methods
 concurrently, even with separate
"jpackage"
ToolProvider
instances, or undefined behavior may result.
