public interface
RMIServer
extends
Remote
RMI object used to establish connections to an RMI connector.
 There is one Remote object implementing this interface for each RMI
 connector.
User code does not usually refer to this interface.  It is
 specified as part of the public API so that different
 implementations of that API will interoperate.

String
getVersion
()
           throws
RemoteException
The version of the RMI Connector Protocol understood by this
 connector server.  This is a string with the following format:
protocol-version
implementation-name
The
protocol-version
is a series of
 two or more non-negative integers separated by periods
 (
.
).  An implementation of the version described
 by this documentation must use the string
1.0
here.
After the protocol version there must be a space, followed
 by the implementation name.  The format of the implementation
 name is unspecified.  It is recommended that it include an
 implementation version number.  An implementation can use an
 empty string as its implementation name, for example for
 security reasons.
Returns:
a string with the format described here.
Throws:
RemoteException
- if there is a communication
 exception during the remote method call.
newClient
RMIConnection
newClient
(
Object
credentials)
throws
IOException
Makes a new connection through this RMI connector.  Each
 remote client calls this method to obtain a new RMI object
 representing its connection.
Parameters:
credentials
- this object specifies the user-defined credentials
 to be passed in to the server in order to authenticate the user before
 creating the
RMIConnection
.  Can be null.
Returns:
the newly-created connection object.
Throws:
IOException
- if the new client object cannot be
 created or exported, or if there is a communication exception
 during the remote method call.
SecurityException
- if the given credentials do not
 allow the server to authenticate the caller successfully.
