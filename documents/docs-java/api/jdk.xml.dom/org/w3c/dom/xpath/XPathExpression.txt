Evaluates this XPath expression and returns a result.
Parameters:
contextNode
- The
context
is context node for the
   evaluation of this XPath expression.If the XPathEvaluator was
   obtained by casting the
Document
then this must be
   owned by the same document and must be a

,

,

, or
XPathNamespace
node.If the context node is a
Text
or a
CDATASection
, then the context is interpreted as the
   whole logical text node as seen by XPath, unless the node is empty
   in which case it may not serve as the XPath context.
type
- If a specific
type
is specified, then the
   result will be coerced to return the specified type relying on
   XPath conversions and fail if the desired coercion is not possible.
   This must be one of the type codes of
XPathResult
.
result
- The
result
specifies a specific result
   object which may be reused and returned by this method. If this is
   specified as
null
or the implementation does not reuse
   the specified result, a new result object will be constructed and
   returned.For XPath 1.0 results, this object will be of type
XPathResult
.
Returns:
The result of the evaluation of the XPath expression.For XPath
   1.0 results, this object will be of type
XPathResult
.
Throws:
XPathException
- TYPE_ERR: Raised if the result cannot be converted to return the
   specified type.
DOMException
- WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: The Node is from a document that is not supported
   by the XPathEvaluator that created this
XPathExpression
.
NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: The Node is not a type permitted as an XPath
   context node or the request type is not permitted by this
XPathExpression
