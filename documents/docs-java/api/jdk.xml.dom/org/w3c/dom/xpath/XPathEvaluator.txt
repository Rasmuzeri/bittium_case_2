Interface XPathEvaluator
public interface
XPathEvaluator
The evaluation of XPath expressions is provided by
XPathEvaluator
. In a DOM implementation which supports the
 XPath 3.0 feature, as described above, the
XPathEvaluator
interface will be implemented on the same object which implements the
Document
interface permitting it to be obtained by the usual
 binding-specific method such as casting or by using the DOM Level 3
 getInterface method. In this case the implementation obtained from the
 Document supports the XPath DOM module and is compatible with the XPath
 1.0 specification.
Evaluation of expressions with specialized extension functions or
 variables may not work in all implementations and is, therefore, not
 portable.
XPathEvaluator
implementations may be available
 from other sources that could provide specific support for specialized
 extension functions or variables as would be defined by other
 specifications.

Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 XPath Specification

XPathException
,
DOMException
Creates a parsed XPath expression with resolved namespaces. This is
 useful when an expression will be reused in an application since it
 makes it possible to compile the expression string into a more
 efficient internal form and preresolve all namespace prefixes which
 occur within the expression.
Parameters:
expression
- The XPath expression string to be parsed.
resolver
- The
resolver
permits translation of
   prefixes within the XPath expression into appropriate namespace URIs
   . If this is specified as
null
, any namespace prefix
   within the expression will result in
DOMException
being thrown with the code
NAMESPACE_ERR
.
Returns:
The compiled form of the XPath expression.
Throws:
XPathException
- INVALID_EXPRESSION_ERR: Raised if the expression is not legal
   according to the rules of the
XPathEvaluator
i
DOMException
- NAMESPACE_ERR: Raised if the expression contains namespace prefixes
   which cannot be resolved by the specified
XPathNSResolver
.

(
Node
nodeResolver)
Adapts any DOM node to resolve namespaces so that an XPath expression
 can be easily evaluated relative to the context of the node where it
 appeared within the document. This adapter works like the DOM Level 3
 method
lookupNamespaceURI
on nodes in resolving the
 namespaceURI from a given prefix using the current information
 available in the node's hierarchy at the time lookupNamespaceURI is
 called. also correctly resolving the implicit xml prefix.
Parameters:
nodeResolver
- The node to be used as a context for namespace
   resolution.
Returns:
XPathNSResolver
which resolves namespaces with
   respect to the definitions in scope for a specified node.

XPathException
,
DOMException
Evaluates an XPath expression string and returns a result of the
 specified type if possible.
Parameters:
expression
- The XPath expression string to be parsed and
   evaluated.
contextNode
- The
context
is context node for the
   evaluation of this XPath expression. If the XPathEvaluator was
   obtained by casting the
Document
then this must be
   owned by the same document and must be a

,

, or
XPathNamespace
node. If the context node is a
Text
or a
CDATASection
, then the context is interpreted as the
   whole logical text node as seen by XPath, unless the node is empty
   in which case it may not serve as the XPath context.
resolver
- The
resolver
permits translation of
   prefixes within the XPath expression into appropriate namespace URIs
   . If this is specified as
null
, any namespace prefix
   within the expression will result in
DOMException
being thrown with the code
NAMESPACE_ERR
.
type
- If a specific
type
is specified, then the
   result will be returned as the corresponding type.For XPath 1.0
   results, this must be one of the codes of the
XPathResult
interface.
result
- The
result
specifies a specific result
   object which may be reused and returned by this method. If this is
   specified as
null
or the implementation does not reuse
   the specified result, a new result object will be constructed and
   returned.For XPath 1.0 results, this object will be of type
XPathResult
.
Returns:
The result of the evaluation of the XPath expression.For XPath
   1.0 results, this object will be of type
XPathResult
.
Throws:
XPathException
- INVALID_EXPRESSION_ERR: Raised if the expression is not legal
   according to the rules of the
XPathEvaluator
i
TYPE_ERR: Raised if the result cannot be converted to return the
   specified type.
DOMException
- NAMESPACE_ERR: Raised if the expression contains namespace prefixes
   which cannot be resolved by the specified
XPathNSResolver
.
WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: The Node is from a document that is not
   supported by this
XPathEvaluator
.
NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: The Node is not a type permitted as an XPath
   context node or the request type is not permitted by this
XPathEvaluator
.
