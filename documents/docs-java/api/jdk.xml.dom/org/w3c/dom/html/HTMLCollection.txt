HTMLCollection
An
HTMLCollection
is a list of nodes. An individual node may
 be accessed by either ordinal index or the node's
name
or
id
attributes.  Note: Collections in the HTML DOM are assumed
 to be  live meaning that they are automatically updated when the
 underlying document is changed.

Node
item
(int index)
This method retrieves a node specified by ordinal index. Nodes are
 numbered in tree order (depth-first traversal order).
Parameters:
index
- The index of the node to be fetched. The index origin is
   0.
Returns:
The
Node
at the corresponding position upon
   success. A value of
null
is returned if the index is
   out of range.
namedItem

using a name. It first
 searches for a
Node
with a matching
id
attribute. If it doesn't find one, it then searches for a
Node
with a matching
name
attribute, but
 only on those elements that are allowed a name attribute.
Parameters:
name
- The name of the
Node
to be fetched.
Returns:
The
Node
with a
name
or
id
attribute whose value corresponds to the specified
   string. Upon failure (e.g., no node with this name exists), returns
null
.
