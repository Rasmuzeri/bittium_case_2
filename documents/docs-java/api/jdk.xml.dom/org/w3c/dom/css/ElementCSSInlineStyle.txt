Interface ElementCSSInlineStyle
public interface
ElementCSSInlineStyle
Inline style information attached to elements is exposed through the
style
attribute. This represents the contents of the STYLE
 attribute for HTML elements (or elements in other schemas or DTDs which
 use the STYLE attribute in the same way). The expectation is that an
 instance of the ElementCSSInlineStyle interface can be obtained by using
 binding-specific casting methods on an instance of the Element interface
 when the element supports inline CSS style information.
