Interface DocumentCSS
All Superinterfaces:
DocumentStyle
public interface
DocumentCSS
extends
DocumentStyle
This interface represents a document with a CSS view.
The
getOverrideStyle
method provides a mechanism through
 which a DOM author could effect immediate change to the style of an
 element without modifying the explicitly linked style sheets of a
 document or the inline style of elements in the style sheets. This style
 sheet comes after the author style sheet in the cascade algorithm and is
 called override style sheet. The override style sheet takes precedence
 over author style sheets. An "!important" declaration still takes
 precedence over a normal declaration. Override, author, and user style
 sheets all may contain "!important" declarations. User "!important" rules
 take precedence over both override and author "!important" rules, and
 override "!important" rules take precedence over author "!important"
 rules.
The expectation is that an instance of the
DocumentCSS
interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on an
 instance of the
Document
interface.
