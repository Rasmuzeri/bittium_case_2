Interface RGBColor
public interface
RGBColor
The
RGBColor
interface is used to represent any RGB color
 value. This interface reflects the values in the underlying style
 property. Hence, modifications made to the
CSSPrimitiveValue
objects modify the style property.
A specified RGB color is not clipped (even if the number is outside the
 range 0-255 or 0%-100%). A computed RGB color is clipped depending on the
 device.
Even if a style sheet can only contain an integer for a color value,
 the internal storage of this integer is a float, and this can be used as
 a float in the specified or the computed style.
A color percentage value can always be converted to a number and vice
 versa.

Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Style Specification

1.4, DOM Level 2
