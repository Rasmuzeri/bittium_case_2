CSSRule
The
CSSRule
interface is the abstract base interface for any
 type of CSS statement. This includes both rule sets and at-rules. An
 implementation is expected to preserve all rules specified in a CSS style
 sheet, even if the rule is not recognized by the parser. Unrecognized
 rules are represented using the
CSSUnknownRule
interface.
