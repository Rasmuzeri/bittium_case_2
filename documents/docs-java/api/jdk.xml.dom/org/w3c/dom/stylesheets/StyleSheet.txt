StyleSheet
The
StyleSheet
interface is the abstract base interface for
 any type of style sheet. It represents a single style sheet associated
 with a structured document. In HTML, the StyleSheet interface represents
 either an external style sheet, included via the HTML  LINK element, or
 an inline  STYLE element. In XML, this interface represents an external
 style sheet, included via a style sheet processing instruction.

Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Style Specification

if the style sheet is applied to the document.
String

getMedia
()
The intended destination media for style information.
Node
getOwnerNode
()
The node that associates this style sheet with the document.
StyleSheet
getParentStyleSheet
()
For style sheet languages that support the concept of style sheet
 inclusion, this attribute represents the including style sheet, if
 one exists.
String
getTitle
()
The advisory title.
String
getType
()
This specifies the style sheet language for this style sheet.
void

(boolean disabled)
false
if the style sheet is applied to the document.
Method Details
getType
String
getType
()
This specifies the style sheet language for this style sheet. The
 style sheet language is specified as a content type (e.g.
 "text/css"). The content type is often specified in the
ownerNode
. Also see the type attribute definition for
 the
LINK
element in HTML 4.0, and the type
 pseudo-attribute for the XML style sheet processing instruction.
getDisabled
boolean
getDisabled
()
false
if the style sheet is applied to the document.
true
if it is not. Modifying this attribute may cause a
 new resolution of style for the document. A stylesheet only applies
 if both an appropriate medium definition is present and the disabled
 attribute is false. So, if the media doesn't apply to the current
 user agent, the
disabled
attribute is ignored.
setDisabled
void
setDisabled
(boolean disabled)
false
if the style sheet is applied to the document.
true
if it is not. Modifying this attribute may cause a
 new resolution of style for the document. A stylesheet only applies
 if both an appropriate medium definition is present and the disabled
 attribute is false. So, if the media doesn't apply to the current
 user agent, the
disabled
attribute is ignored.
getOwnerNode
Node
getOwnerNode
()
The node that associates this style sheet with the document. For HTML,
 this may be the corresponding
LINK
or
STYLE
element. For XML, it may be the linking processing instruction. For
 style sheets that are included by other style sheets, the value of
 this attribute is
null
.
getParentStyleSheet
StyleSheet
getParentStyleSheet
()
For style sheet languages that support the concept of style sheet
 inclusion, this attribute represents the including style sheet, if
 one exists. If the style sheet is a top-level style sheet, or the
 style sheet language does not support inclusion, the value of this
 attribute is
null
.
getHref
String
getHref
()
If the style sheet is a linked style sheet, the value of its attribute
 is its location. For inline style sheets, the value of this attribute
 is
null
. See the href attribute definition for the
LINK
element in HTML 4.0, and the href pseudo-attribute
 for the XML style sheet processing instruction.
getTitle
String
getTitle
()
The advisory title. The title is often specified in the
ownerNode
. See the title attribute definition for the
LINK
element in HTML 4.0, and the title pseudo-attribute
 for the XML style sheet processing instruction.
getMedia
MediaList
getMedia
()
The intended destination media for style information. The media is
 often specified in the
ownerNode
. If no media has been
 specified, the
MediaList
will be empty. See the media
 attribute definition for the
LINK
element in HTML 4.0,
 and the media pseudo-attribute for the XML style sheet processing
 instruction . Modifying the media list may cause a change to the
 attribute
disabled
.
