Interface MediaList
public interface
MediaList
The
MediaList
interface provides the abstraction of an
 ordered collection of media, without defining or constraining how this
 collection is implemented. An empty list is the same as a list that
 contains the medium
"all"
.
The items in the
MediaList
are accessible via an integral
 index, starting from 0.
See also the
Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Style Specification
.
Since:
1.4, DOM Level 2
