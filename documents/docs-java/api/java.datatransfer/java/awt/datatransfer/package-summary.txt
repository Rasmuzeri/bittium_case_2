java.awt.datatransfer
Provides interfaces and classes for transferring data between and within
 applications. It defines the notion of a "transferable" object, which is an
 object capable of being transferred between or within applications. An object
 identifies itself as being transferable by implementing the Transferable
 interface.
It also provides a clipboard mechanism, which is an object that temporarily
 holds a transferable object that can be transferred between or within an
 application. The clipboard is typically used for copy and paste operations.
 Although it is possible to create a clipboard to use within an application,
 most applications will use the system clipboard to ensure the data can be
 transferred across applications running on the platform.
