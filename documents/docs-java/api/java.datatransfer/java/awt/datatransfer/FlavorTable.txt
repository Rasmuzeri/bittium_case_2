Interface FlavorTable
All Superinterfaces:
FlavorMap
All Known Implementing Classes:
SystemFlavorMap
public interface
FlavorTable
extends
FlavorMap
A FlavorMap which relaxes the traditional 1-to-1 restriction of a Map. A
 flavor is permitted to map to any number of natives, and likewise a native is
 permitted to map to any number of flavors. FlavorTables need not be
 symmetric, but typically are.

Method Details
getNativesForFlavor
List
<
String
>
getNativesForFlavor
(
DataFlavor
flav)
Returns a
List
of
String
natives to which the specified
DataFlavor
corresponds. The
List
will be sorted from best
 native to worst. That is, the first native will best reflect data in the
 specified flavor to the underlying native platform. The returned
List
is a modifiable copy of this
FlavorTable
's internal
 data. Client code is free to modify the
List
without affecting
 this object.
Parameters:
flav
- the
DataFlavor
whose corresponding natives should be
         returned. If
null
is specified, all natives currently
         known to this
FlavorTable
are returned in a
         non-deterministic order.
Returns:
a
java.util.List
of
java.lang.String
objects
         which are platform-specific representations of platform-specific
         data formats
getFlavorsForNative
List
<
DataFlavor
>
getFlavorsForNative
(
String
nat)
Returns a
List
of
DataFlavor
s to which the specified
String
corresponds. The
List
will be sorted from best
DataFlavor
to worst. That is, the first
DataFlavor
will
 best reflect data in the specified native to a Java application. The
 returned
List
is a modifiable copy of this
FlavorTable
's
 internal data. Client code is free to modify the
List
without
 affecting this object.
Parameters:
nat
- the native whose corresponding
DataFlavor
s should be
         returned. If
null
is specified, all
DataFlavor
s
         currently known to this
FlavorTable
are returned in a
         non-deterministic order.
Returns:
a
java.util.List
of
DataFlavor
objects into which
         platform-specific data in the specified, platform-specific native
         can be translated
