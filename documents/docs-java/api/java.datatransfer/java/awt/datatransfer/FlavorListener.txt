Method Details
flavorsChanged
void
flavorsChanged
(
FlavorEvent
e)
Invoked when the target
Clipboard
of the listener has changed its
 available
DataFlavor
s.
Some notifications may be redundant — they are not caused by a
 change of the set of DataFlavors available on the clipboard. For example,
 if the clipboard subsystem supposes that the system clipboard's contents
 has been changed but it can't ascertain whether its DataFlavors have been
 changed because of some exceptional condition when accessing the
 clipboard, the notification is sent to ensure from omitting a significant
 notification. Ordinarily, those redundant notifications should be
 occasional.
Parameters:
e
- a
FlavorEvent
object
