setContents
public
void
setContents
(
Transferable
contents,
ClipboardOwner
owner)
Sets the current contents of the clipboard to the specified transferable
 object and registers the specified clipboard owner as the owner of the
 new contents.
If there is an existing owner different from the argument
owner
,
 that owner is notified that it no longer holds ownership of the clipboard
 contents via an invocation of
ClipboardOwner.lostOwnership()
on
 that owner. An implementation of
setContents()
is free not to
 invoke
lostOwnership()
directly from this method. For example,
lostOwnership()
may be invoked later on a different thread. The
 same applies to
FlavorListener
s registered on this clipboard.
The method throws
IllegalStateException
if the clipboard is
 currently unavailable. For example, on some platforms, the system
 clipboard is unavailable while it is accessed by another application.
Parameters:
contents
- the transferable object representing the clipboard
         content
owner
- the object which owns the clipboard content
Throws:
IllegalStateException
- if the clipboard is currently unavailable
See Also:
Toolkit.getSystemClipboard()

getContents
(
Object
requestor)
Returns a transferable object representing the current contents of the
 clipboard. If the clipboard currently has no contents, it returns
null
. The parameter Object requestor is not currently used. The
 method throws
IllegalStateException
if the clipboard is currently
 unavailable. For example, on some platforms, the system clipboard is
 unavailable while it is accessed by another application.
Parameters:
requestor
- the object requesting the clip data (not used)
Returns:
the current transferable object on the clipboard
Throws:
IllegalStateException
- if the clipboard is currently unavailable
