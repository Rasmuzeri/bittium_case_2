Interface HasControls
All Known Subinterfaces:
UnsolicitedNotification
public interface
HasControls
This interface is for returning controls with objects returned
 in NamingEnumerations.
 For example, suppose a server sends back controls with the results
 of a search operation, the service provider would return a NamingEnumeration of
 objects that are both SearchResult and implement HasControls.
NamingEnumeration elts = ectx.search((Name)name, filter, sctls);
   while (elts.hasMore()) {
     Object entry = elts.next();

     // Get search result
     SearchResult res = (SearchResult)entry;
     // do something with it

     // Get entry controls
     if (entry instanceof HasControls) {
         Control[] entryCtls = ((HasControls)entry).getControls();
         // do something with controls
     }
   }
