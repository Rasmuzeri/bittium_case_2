Interface ExtendedResponse

public interface
ExtendedResponse
extends
Serializable
This interface represents an LDAP extended operation response as defined in
RFC 2251
.
ExtendedResponse ::= [APPLICATION 24] SEQUENCE {
          COMPONENTS OF LDAPResult,
          responseName     [10] LDAPOID OPTIONAL,
          response         [11] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL }
It comprises an optional object identifier and an optional ASN.1 BER
 encoded value.
The methods in this class can be used by the application to get low
 level information about the extended operation response. However, typically,
 the application will be using methods specific to the class that
 implements this interface. Such a class should have decoded the BER buffer
 in the response and should provide methods that allow the user to
 access that data in the response in a type-safe and friendly manner.
For example, suppose the LDAP server supported a 'get time' extended operation.
 It would supply GetTimeRequest and GetTimeResponse classes.
 The GetTimeResponse class might look like:
public class GetTimeResponse implements ExtendedResponse {
     public java.util.Date getDate() {...};
     public long getTime() {...};
     ....
 }
A program would use then these classes as follows:
GetTimeResponse resp =
     (GetTimeResponse) ectx.extendedOperation(new GetTimeRequest());
 java.util.Date now = resp.getDate();
Since:
1.3

Retrieves the object identifier of the response.
Method Details
getID
String
getID
()
Retrieves the object identifier of the response.
 The LDAP protocol specifies that the response object identifier is optional.
 If the server does not send it, the response will contain no ID (i.e. null).
Returns:
A possibly null object identifier string representing the LDAP
ExtendedResponse.responseName
component.
getEncodedValue
byte[]
getEncodedValue
()
Retrieves the ASN.1 BER encoded value of the LDAP extended operation
 response. Null is returned if the value is absent from the response
 sent by the LDAP server.
 The result is the raw BER bytes including the tag and length of
 the response value. It does not include the response OID.
Returns:
A possibly null byte array representing the ASN.1 BER encoded
         contents of the LDAP
ExtendedResponse.response
component.
