Class LdapDnsProvider
java.lang.Object
javax.naming.ldap.spi.LdapDnsProvider
public abstract class
LdapDnsProvider
extends
Object
Service-provider class for DNS lookups when performing LDAP operations.
An LDAP DNS provider is a concrete subclass of this class that
 has a zero-argument constructor. LDAP DNS providers are located using the
 ServiceLoader facility, as specified by
InitialDirectContext
.

 The
ServiceLoader
is used to create and register
 implementations of
LdapDnsProvider
.
An LDAP DNS provider can be used in environments where the default
 DNS resolution mechanism is not sufficient to accurately pinpoint the
 correct LDAP servers needed to perform LDAP operations. For example, in an
 environment containing a mix of
ldap
and
ldaps
servers
 you may want the
LdapContext
to query
ldaps
servers only.

 points to an LDAP server to be used for LDAP operations. The syntax of
 an LDAP URL is defined by
RFC 2255: The LDAP URL Format
.
Parameters:
url
- The
Context
provider URL
env
- The
Context
environment.
Returns:
an
LdapDnsProviderResult
or empty
Optional
if the lookup fails.
Throws:
NamingException
- if the
url
is not valid or an error
                              occurred while performing the lookup.

- if either
url
or
env
are
null
