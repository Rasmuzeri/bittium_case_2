public interface
Control
extends
Serializable
This interface represents an LDAPv3 control as defined in
RFC 2251
.
The LDAPv3 protocol uses controls to send and receive additional data
 to affect the behavior of predefined operations.
 Controls can be sent along with any LDAP operation to the server.
 These are referred to as
request controls
. For example, a
 "sort" control can be sent with an LDAP search operation to
 request that the results be returned in a particular order.
 Solicited and unsolicited controls can also be returned with
 responses from the server. Such controls are referred to as
response controls
. For example, an LDAP server might
 define a special control to return change notifications.
This interface is used to represent both request and response controls.

Method Details
getID
String
getID
()
Retrieves the object identifier assigned for the LDAP control.
Returns:
The non-null object identifier string.
isCritical
boolean
isCritical
()
Determines the criticality of the LDAP control.
 A critical control must not be ignored by the server.
 In other words, if the server receives a critical control
 that it does not support, regardless of whether the control
 makes sense for the operation, the operation will not be performed
 and an
OperationNotSupportedException
will be thrown.
Returns:
true if this control is critical; false otherwise.
getEncodedValue
byte[]
getEncodedValue
()
Retrieves the ASN.1 BER encoded value of the LDAP control.
 The result is the raw BER bytes including the tag and length of
 the control's value. It does not include the controls OID or criticality.

 Null is returned if the value is absent.
Returns:
A possibly null byte array representing the ASN.1 BER encoded
         value of the LDAP control.
