Class StartTlsRequest
java.lang.Object
javax.naming.ldap.StartTlsRequest
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
,
ExtendedRequest
public class
StartTlsRequest
extends
Object
implements
ExtendedRequest
This class implements the LDAPv3 Extended Request for StartTLS as
 defined in
Lightweight Directory
 Access Protocol (v3): Extension for Transport Layer Security
The object identifier for StartTLS is 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.20037
 and no extended request value is defined.
StartTlsRequest
/
StartTlsResponse
are used to establish
 a TLS connection over the existing LDAP connection associated with
 the JNDI context on which
extendedOperation()
is invoked.
 Typically, a JNDI program uses these classes as follows.
import javax.naming.ldap.*;

 // Open an LDAP association
 LdapContext ctx = new InitialLdapContext();

 // Perform a StartTLS extended operation
 StartTlsResponse tls =
     (StartTlsResponse) ctx.extendedOperation(new StartTlsRequest());

 // Open a TLS connection (over the existing LDAP association) and get details
 // of the negotiated TLS session: cipher suite, peer certificate, etc.
 SSLSession session = tls.negotiate();

 // ... use ctx to perform protected LDAP operations

 // Close the TLS connection (revert back to the underlying LDAP association)
 tls.close();

 // ... use ctx to perform unprotected LDAP operations

 // Close the LDAP association
 ctx.close;

1.4

getID
()
Retrieves the StartTLS request's object identifier string.
Specified by:

ExtendedRequest
Returns:
The object identifier string, "1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.20037".
getEncodedValue

getEncodedValue
()
Retrieves the StartTLS request's ASN.1 BER encoded value.
 Since the request has no defined value, null is always
 returned.

Returns:
The null value.

NamingException
Creates an extended response object that corresponds to the
 LDAP StartTLS extended request.
The result must be a concrete subclass of StartTlsResponse
 and must have a public zero-argument constructor.
This method locates the implementation class by locating
 configuration files that have the name:
META-INF/services/javax.naming.ldap.StartTlsResponse
The configuration files and their corresponding implementation classes must
 be accessible to the calling thread's context class loader.
Each configuration file should contain a list of fully-qualified class
 names, one per line.  Space and tab characters surrounding each name, as
 well as blank lines, are ignored.  The comment character is
'#'
(
0x23
); on each line all characters following the first comment
 character are ignored.  The file must be encoded in UTF-8.
This method will return an instance of the first implementation
 class that it is able to load and instantiate successfully from
 the list of class names collected from the configuration files.
 This method uses the calling thread's context classloader to find the
 configuration files and to load the implementation class.
If no class can be found in this way, this method will use
 an implementation-specific way to locate an implementation.
 If none is found, a NamingException is thrown.
Specified by:
createExtendedResponse
in interface
ExtendedRequest
Parameters:
id
- The object identifier of the extended response.
                   Its value must be "1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.20037" or null.
                   Both values are equivalent.
berValue
- The possibly null ASN.1 BER encoded value of the
                   extended response. This is the raw BER bytes
                   including the tag and length of the response value.
                   It does not include the response OID.
                   Its value is ignored because a Start TLS response
                   is not expected to contain any response value.
offset
- The starting position in berValue of the bytes to use.
                   Its value is ignored because a Start TLS response
                   is not expected to contain any response value.
length
- The number of bytes in berValue to use.
                   Its value is ignored because a Start TLS response
                   is not expected to contain any response value.
Returns:
The StartTLS extended response object.
Throws:
NamingException
- If a naming exception was encountered
                   while creating the StartTLS extended response object.
