LinkException
extends
NamingException
This exception is used to describe problems encountered while resolving links.
 Additional information is added to the base NamingException for pinpointing
 the problem with the link.
Analogously to how NamingException captures name resolution information,
 LinkException captures "link"-name resolution information pinpointing
 the problem encountered while resolving a link. All these fields may
 be null.
Link Resolved Name. Portion of link name that has been resolved.
Link Resolved Object. Object to which resolution of link name proceeded.
Link Remaining Name. Portion of link name that has not been resolved.
Link Explanation. Detail explaining why link resolution failed.
A LinkException instance is not synchronized against concurrent
 multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify
 a single LinkException instance should lock the object.
Since:
1.3

LinkException
public
LinkException
(
String

Constructs a new instance of LinkException with an explanation.
 All the other fields are initialized to null.
Parameters:
explanation
- A possibly null string containing additional
                         detail about this exception.
See Also:
Throwable.getMessage()
LinkException
public
LinkException
()
Constructs a new instance of LinkException.
 All the non-link-related and link-related fields are initialized to null.
Method Details
getLinkResolvedName
public
Name
getLinkResolvedName
()
Retrieves the leading portion of the link name that was resolved
 successfully.
Returns:
The part of the link name that was resolved successfully.
          It is a composite name. It can be null, which means
          the link resolved name field has not been set.
See Also:
getLinkResolvedObj()
setLinkResolvedName(javax.naming.Name)
getLinkRemainingName
public
Name
getLinkRemainingName
()
Retrieves the remaining unresolved portion of the link name.
Returns:
The part of the link name that has not been resolved.
          It is a composite name. It can be null, which means
          the link remaining name field has not been set.
See Also:
setLinkRemainingName(javax.naming.Name)
getLinkResolvedObj
public
Object
getLinkResolvedObj
()
Retrieves the object to which resolution was successful.
 This is the object to which the resolved link name is bound.
Returns:
The possibly null object that was resolved so far.
 If null, it means the link resolved object field has not been set.
See Also:
getLinkResolvedName()
setLinkResolvedObj(java.lang.Object)
getLinkExplanation
public
String
getLinkExplanation
()
Retrieves the explanation associated with the problem encountered
 when resolving a link.
Returns:
The possibly null detail string explaining more about the problem
 with resolving a link.
         If null, it means there is no
         link detail message for this exception.
See Also:
setLinkExplanation(java.lang.String)
setLinkExplanation
public
void
setLinkExplanation
(
String
msg)
Sets the explanation associated with the problem encountered
 when resolving a link.
Parameters:
msg
- The possibly null detail string explaining more about the problem
 with resolving a link. If null, it means no detail will be recorded.
See Also:
getLinkExplanation()
setLinkResolvedName
public
void
setLinkResolvedName
(
Name
name)
Sets the resolved link name field of this exception.
name
is a composite name. If the intent is to set
 this field using a compound name or string, you must
 "stringify" the compound name, and create a composite
 name with a single component using the string. You can then
 invoke this method using the resulting composite name.
A copy of
name
is made and stored.
 Subsequent changes to
name
do not
 affect the copy in this NamingException and vice versa.
Parameters:
name
- The name to set resolved link name to. This can be null.
          If null, it sets the link resolved name field to null.
See Also:
getLinkResolvedName()
setLinkRemainingName
public
void
setLinkRemainingName
(
Name
name)
Sets the remaining link name field of this exception.
name
is a composite name. If the intent is to set
 this field using a compound name or string, you must
 "stringify" the compound name, and create a composite
 name with a single component using the string. You can then
 invoke this method using the resulting composite name.
A copy of
name
is made and stored.
 Subsequent changes to
name
do not
 affect the copy in this NamingException and vice versa.
Parameters:
name
- The name to set remaining link name to. This can be null.
  If null, it sets the remaining name field to null.
See Also:
getLinkRemainingName()
setLinkResolvedObj
public
void
setLinkResolvedObj
(
Object
obj)
Sets the link resolved object field of this exception.
 This indicates the last successfully resolved object of link name.
Parameters:
obj
- The object to set link resolved object to. This can be null.
            If null, the link resolved object field is set to null.
See Also:
getLinkResolvedObj()
toString
public
String
toString
()
Generates the string representation of this exception.
 This string consists of the NamingException information plus
 the link's remaining name.
 This string is used for debugging and not meant to be interpreted
 programmatically.
Overrides:
toString
in class
NamingException
Returns:
The non-null string representation of this link exception.
toString
public
String
toString
(boolean detail)
Generates the string representation of this exception.
 This string consists of the NamingException information plus
 the additional information of resolving the link.
 If 'detail' is true, the string also contains information on
 the link resolved object. If false, this method is the same
 as the form of toString() that accepts no parameters.
 This string is used for debugging and not meant to be interpreted
 programmatically.
Overrides:
toString
in class
NamingException
Parameters:
detail
- If true, add information about the link resolved
                  object.
Returns:
The non-null string representation of this link exception.
