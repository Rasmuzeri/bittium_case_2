Interface InitialContextFactory
public interface
InitialContextFactory
This interface represents a factory that creates an initial context.
The JNDI framework allows for different initial context implementations
 to be specified at runtime.  The initial context is created using
 an
initial context factory
.
 An initial context factory must implement the InitialContextFactory
 interface, which provides a method for creating instances of initial
 context that implement the Context interface.
 In addition, the factory class must be public and must have a public
 constructor that accepts no arguments.
Since:
1.3

             of the initial context.

             interface.
