Interface NamingListener
All Superinterfaces:
EventListener
All Known Subinterfaces:
NamespaceChangeListener
,
ObjectChangeListener
,
UnsolicitedNotificationListener
public interface
NamingListener
extends
EventListener
This interface is the root of listener interfaces that
 handle
NamingEvent
s.
 It does not make sense for a listener to implement just this interface.
 A listener typically implements a subinterface of
NamingListener
,
 such as
ObjectChangeListener
or
NamespaceChangeListener
.
This interface contains a single method,
namingExceptionThrown()
,
 that must be implemented so that the listener can be notified of
 exceptions that are thrown (by the service provider) while gathering
 information about the events that they're interested in.
 When this method is invoked, the listener has been automatically deregistered
 from the
EventContext
with which it has registered.
For example, suppose a listener implements
ObjectChangeListener
and
 registers with an
EventContext
.
 Then, if the connection to the server is subsequently broken,
 the listener will receive a
NamingExceptionEvent
and may
 take some corrective action, such as notifying the user of the application.
