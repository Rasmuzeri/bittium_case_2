Interface NamespaceChangeListener
All Superinterfaces:
EventListener
,
NamingListener
public interface
NamespaceChangeListener
extends
NamingListener
Specifies the methods that a listener interested in namespace changes
 must implement.
 Specifically, the listener is interested in
NamingEvent
s
 with event types of
OBJECT_ADDED, OBJECT_RENAMED
, or
OBJECT_REMOVED
.
Such a listener must:
Implement this interface and its methods.
Implement
NamingListener.namingExceptionThrown()
so that
 it will be notified of exceptions thrown while attempting to
 collect information about the events.
Register with the source using the source's
addNamingListener()
method.
A listener that wants to be notified of
OBJECT_CHANGED
event types
 should also implement the
ObjectChangeListener
interface.
Since:
1.3
