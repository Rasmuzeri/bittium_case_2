Class StringRefAddr
java.lang.Object
javax.naming.RefAddr
javax.naming.StringRefAddr
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
StringRefAddr
extends
RefAddr
This class represents the string form of the address of
 a communications end-point.
 It consists of a type that describes the communication mechanism
 and a string contents specific to that communication mechanism.
 The format and interpretation of
 the address type and the contents of the address are based on
 the agreement of three parties: the client that uses the address,
 the object/server that can be reached using the address, and the
 administrator or program that creates the address.
An example of a string reference address is a host name.
 Another example of a string reference address is a URL.
A string reference address is immutable:
 once created, it cannot be changed.  Multithreaded access to
 a single StringRefAddr need not be synchronized.
