CompoundName
extends
Object
implements
Name
This class represents a compound name -- a name from
 a hierarchical name space.
 Each component in a compound name is an atomic name.
The components of a compound name are numbered.  The indexes of a
 compound name with N components range from 0 up to, but not including, N.
 This range may be written as [0,N).
 The most significant component is at index 0.
 An empty compound name has no components.
Compound Name Syntax
The syntax of a compound name is specified using a set of properties:
jndi.syntax.direction
Direction for parsing ("right_to_left", "left_to_right", "flat").
      If unspecified, defaults to "flat", which means the namespace is flat
      with no hierarchical structure.
jndi.syntax.separator
Separator between atomic name components.
      Required unless direction is "flat".
jndi.syntax.ignorecase
If present, "true" means ignore the case when comparing name
      components. If its value is not "true", or if the property is not
      present, case is considered when comparing name components.
jndi.syntax.escape
If present, specifies the escape string for overriding separator,
      escapes and quotes.
jndi.syntax.beginquote
If present, specifies the string delimiting start of a quoted string.
jndi.syntax.endquote
String delimiting end of quoted string.
      If present, specifies the string delimiting the end of a quoted string.
      If not present, use syntax.beginquote as end quote.
jndi.syntax.beginquote2
Alternative set of begin/end quotes.
jndi.syntax.endquote2
Alternative set of begin/end quotes.
jndi.syntax.trimblanks
If present, "true" means trim any leading and trailing whitespaces
      in a name component for comparison purposes. If its value is not
      "true", or if the property is not present, blanks are significant.
jndi.syntax.separator.ava
If present, specifies the string that separates
      attribute-value-assertions when specifying multiple attribute/value
      pairs. (e.g. ","  in age=65,gender=male).
jndi.syntax.separator.typeval
If present, specifies the string that separates attribute
              from value (e.g. "=" in "age=65")
These properties are interpreted according to the following rules:
In a string without quotes or escapes, any instance of the
 separator delimits two atomic names. Each atomic name is referred
 to as a
component
.
A separator, quote or escape is escaped if preceded immediately
 (on the left) by the escape.
If there are two sets of quotes, a specific begin-quote must be matched
 by its corresponding end-quote.
A non-escaped begin-quote which precedes a component must be
 matched by a non-escaped end-quote at the end of the component.
 A component thus quoted is referred to as a
quoted component
. It is parsed by
 removing the being- and end- quotes, and by treating the intervening
 characters as ordinary characters unless one of the rules involving
 quoted components listed below applies.
Quotes embedded in non-quoted components are treated as ordinary strings
 and need not be matched.
A separator that is escaped or appears between non-escaped
 quotes is treated as an ordinary string and not a separator.
An escape string within a quoted component acts as an escape only when
 followed by the corresponding end-quote string.
 This can be used to embed an escaped quote within a quoted component.
An escaped escape string is not treated as an escape string.
An escape string that does not precede a meta string (quotes or separator)
 and is not at the end of a component is treated as an ordinary string.
A leading separator (the compound name string begins with
 a separator) denotes a leading empty atomic component (consisting
 of an empty string).
 A trailing separator (the compound name string ends with
 a separator) denotes a trailing empty atomic component.
 Adjacent separators denote an empty atomic component.
The string form of the compound name follows the syntax described above.
 When the components of the compound name are turned into their
 string representation, the reserved syntax rules described above are
 applied (e.g. embedded separators are escaped or quoted)
 so that when the same string is parsed, it will yield the same components
 of the original compound name.
Multithreaded Access
A
CompoundName
instance is not synchronized against concurrent
 multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify a
CompoundName
should lock the object.

 Any necessary changes to mySyntax should be made within constructors
 and not after the compound name has been instantiated.
Constructor Details
CompoundName
protected
CompoundName
(
Enumeration
<
String
> comps,
Properties
syntax)
Constructs a new compound name instance using the components
 specified in comps and syntax. This protected method is intended
 to be used by subclasses of CompoundName when they override
 methods such as clone(), getPrefix(), getSuffix().
Parameters:
comps
- A non-null enumeration of the components to add.
   Each element of the enumeration is of class String.
               The enumeration will be consumed to extract its
               elements.
syntax
- A non-null properties that specify the syntax of
                 this compound name. See class description for
                 contents of properties.

- The non-null string to parse.
syntax
- A non-null list of properties that specify the syntax of
                 this compound name.  See class description for
                 contents of properties.
Throws:
InvalidNameException
- If 'n' violates the syntax specified
                 by
syntax
.
Method Details
toString
public
String
toString
()
Generates the string representation of this compound name, using
 the syntax rules of the compound name. The syntax rules
 are described in the class description.
 An empty component is represented by an empty string.

 The string representation thus generated can be passed to
 the CompoundName constructor with the same syntax properties
 to create a new equivalent compound name.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
A non-null string representation of this compound name.
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Determines whether obj is syntactically equal to this compound name.
 If obj is null or not a CompoundName, false is returned.
 Two compound names are equal if each component in one is "equal"
 to the corresponding component in the other.
Equality is also defined in terms of the syntax of this compound name.
 The default implementation of CompoundName uses the syntax properties
 jndi.syntax.ignorecase and jndi.syntax.trimblanks when comparing
 two components for equality.  If case is ignored, two strings
 with the same sequence of characters but with different cases
 are considered equal. If blanks are being trimmed, leading and trailing
 blanks are ignored for the purpose of the comparison.
Both compound names must have the same number of components.
Implementation note: Currently the syntax properties of the two compound
 names are not compared for equality. They might be in the future.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- The possibly null object to compare against.
Returns:
true if obj is equal to this compound name, false otherwise.
See Also:
compareTo(java.lang.Object obj)
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Computes the hash code of this compound name.
 The hash code is the sum of the hash codes of the "canonicalized"
 forms of individual components of this compound name.
 Each component is "canonicalized" according to the
 compound name's syntax before its hash code is computed.
 For a case-insensitive name, for example, the uppercased form of
 a name has the same hash code as its lowercased equivalent.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
An int representing the hash code of this name.
See Also:
Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)
clone
public
Object
clone
()
Creates a copy of this compound name.
 Changes to the components of this compound name won't
 affect the new copy and vice versa.
 The clone and this compound name share the same syntax.
Specified by:
clone
in interface
Name
Overrides:
clone
in class
Object
Returns:
A non-null copy of this compound name.
See Also:
Cloneable
compareTo
public
int
compareTo
(
Object
obj)
Compares this CompoundName with the specified Object for order.
 Returns a
 negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this Name is less
 than, equal to, or greater than the given Object.
If obj is null or not an instance of CompoundName, ClassCastException
 is thrown.
See equals() for what it means for two compound names to be equal.
 If two compound names are equal, 0 is returned.
Ordering of compound names depend on the syntax of the compound name.
 By default, they follow lexicographical rules for string comparison
 with the extension that this applies to all the components in the
 compound name and that comparison of individual components is
 affected by the jndi.syntax.ignorecase and jndi.syntax.trimblanks
 properties, identical to how they affect equals().
 If this compound name is "lexicographically" lesser than obj,
 a negative number is returned.
 If this compound name is "lexicographically" greater than obj,
 a positive number is returned.
Implementation note: Currently the syntax properties of the two compound
 names are not compared when checking order. They might be in the future.
