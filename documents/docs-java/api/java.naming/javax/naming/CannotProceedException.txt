Class CannotProceedException
java.lang.Object
java.lang.Throwable
java.lang.Exception
javax.naming.NamingException
javax.naming.CannotProceedException
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
CannotProceedException
extends
NamingException
This exception is thrown to indicate that the operation reached
 a point in the name where the operation cannot proceed any further.
 When performing an operation on a composite name, a naming service
 provider may reach a part of the name that does not belong to its
 namespace.  At that point, it can construct a
 CannotProceedException and then invoke methods provided by
 javax.naming.spi.NamingManager (such as getContinuationContext())
 to locate another provider to continue the operation.  If this is
 not possible, this exception is raised to the caller of the
 context operation.
If the program wants to handle this exception in particular, it
 should catch CannotProceedException explicitly before attempting to
 catch NamingException.
A CannotProceedException instance is not synchronized against concurrent
 multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify
 CannotProceedException should lock the object.

Constructor Details
CannotProceedException
public
CannotProceedException
(
String
explanation)
Constructs a new instance of CannotProceedException using an
 explanation. All unspecified fields default to null.
Parameters:
explanation
- A possibly null string containing additional
                          detail about this exception.
   If null, this exception has no detail message.
See Also:
Throwable.getMessage()
CannotProceedException
public
CannotProceedException
()
Constructs a new instance of CannotProceedException.
 All fields default to null.
Method Details
getEnvironment
public
Hashtable
<?,
?>
getEnvironment
()
Retrieves the environment that was in effect when this exception
 was created.
Returns:
Possibly null environment property set.
          null means no environment was recorded for this exception.
See Also:
setEnvironment(java.util.Hashtable<?, ?>)
setEnvironment
public
void
setEnvironment
(
Hashtable
<?,
?> environment)
Sets the environment that will be returned when getEnvironment()
 is called.
Parameters:
environment
- A possibly null environment property set.
          null means no environment is being recorded for
          this exception.
See Also:
getEnvironment()
getRemainingNewName
public
Name
getRemainingNewName
()
Retrieves the "remaining new name" field of this exception, which is
 used when this exception is thrown during a rename() operation.
Returns:
The possibly null part of the new name that has not been resolved.
          It is a composite name. It can be null, which means
          the remaining new name field has not been set.
See Also:
setRemainingNewName(javax.naming.Name)
setRemainingNewName
public
void
setRemainingNewName
(
Name
newName)
Sets the "remaining new name" field of this exception.
 This is the value returned by
getRemainingNewName()
.
newName
is a composite name. If the intent is to set
 this field using a compound name or string, you must
 "stringify" the compound name, and create a composite
 name with a single component using the string. You can then
 invoke this method using the resulting composite name.
A copy of
newName
is made and stored.
 Subsequent changes to
name
does not
 affect the copy in this NamingException and vice versa.
Parameters:
newName
- The possibly null name to set the "remaining new name" to.
          If null, it sets the remaining name field to null.
See Also:
getRemainingNewName()

field of this exception.
 This is the name of the resolved object, relative to the context
altNameCtx
. It will be used during a subsequent call to the
javax.naming.spi.ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance
method.
Returns:
The name of the resolved object, relative to
altNameCtx
.
          It is a composite name.  If null, then no name is specified.
