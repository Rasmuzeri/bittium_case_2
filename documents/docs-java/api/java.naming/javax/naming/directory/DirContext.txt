public interface
DirContext
extends
Context
The directory service interface, containing
 methods for examining and updating attributes
 associated with objects, and for searching the directory.
Names
Each name passed as an argument to a
DirContext
method is relative
 to that context.  The empty name is used to name the context itself.
 The name parameter may never be null.
Most of the methods have overloaded versions with one taking a
Name
parameter and one taking a
String
.
 These overloaded versions are equivalent in that if
 the
Name
and
String
parameters are just
 different representations of the same name, then the overloaded
 versions of the same methods behave the same.
 In the method descriptions below, only one version is documented.
 The second version instead has a link to the first:  the same
 documentation applies to both.
See
Context
for a discussion on the interpretation of the
 name argument to the
Context
methods. These same rules
 apply to the name argument to the
DirContext
methods.
Attribute Models
There are two basic models of what attributes should be
 associated with.  First, attributes may be directly associated with a
 DirContext object.
 In this model, an attribute operation on the named object is
 roughly equivalent
 to a lookup on the name (which returns the DirContext object),
 followed by the attribute operation invoked on the DirContext object
 in which the caller supplies an empty name. The attributes can be viewed
 as being stored along with the object (note that this does not imply that
 the implementation must do so).
The second model is that attributes are associated with a
 name (typically an atomic name) in a DirContext.
 In this model, an attribute operation on the named object is
 roughly equivalent to a lookup on the name of the parent DirContext of the
 named object, followed by the attribute operation invoked on the parent
 in which the caller supplies the terminal atomic name.
 The attributes can be viewed as being stored in the parent DirContext
 (again, this does not imply that the implementation must do so).
 Objects that are not DirContexts can have attributes, as long as
 their parents are DirContexts.
JNDI support both of these models.
 It is up to the individual service providers to decide where to
 "store" attributes.
 JNDI clients are safest when they do not make assumptions about
 whether an object's attributes are stored as part of the object, or stored
 within the parent object and associated with the object's name.
Attribute Type Names
In the
getAttributes()
and
search()
methods,
 you can supply the attributes to return by supplying a list of
 attribute names (strings).
 The attributes that you get back might not have the same names as the
 attribute names you have specified. This is because some directories
 support features that cause them to return other attributes.  Such
 features include attribute subclassing, attribute name synonyms, and
 attribute language codes.
In attribute subclassing, attributes are defined in a class hierarchy.
 In some directories, for example, the "name" attribute might be the
 superclass of all name-related attributes, including "commonName" and
 "surName".  Asking for the "name" attribute might return both the
 "commonName" and "surName" attributes.
With attribute type synonyms, a directory can assign multiple names to
 the same attribute. For example, "cn" and "commonName" might both
 refer to the same attribute. Asking for "cn" might return the
 "commonName" attribute.
Some directories support the language codes for attributes.
 Asking such a directory for the "description" attribute, for example,
 might return all of the following attributes:
description
description;lang-en
description;lang-de
description;lang-fr
Operational Attributes
Some directories have the notion of "operational attributes" which are
 attributes associated with a directory object for administrative
 purposes. An example of operational attributes is the access control
 list for an object.
In the
getAttributes()
and
search()
methods,
 you can specify that all attributes associated with the requested objects
 be returned by supply
null
as the list of attributes to return.
 The attributes returned do
not
include operational attributes.
 In order to retrieve operational attributes, you must name them explicitly.
Named Context
There are certain methods in which the name must resolve to a context
 (for example, when searching a single level context). The documentation
 of such methods
 use the term
named context
to describe their name parameter.
 For these methods, if the named object is not a DirContext,
NotContextException
is thrown.
 Aside from these methods, there is no requirement that the
named object
be a DirContext.
Parameters
An
Attributes
,
SearchControls
, or array object
 passed as a parameter to any method will not be modified by the
 service provider.  The service provider may keep a reference to it
 for the duration of the operation, including any enumeration of the
 method's results and the processing of any referrals generated.
 The caller should not modify the object during this time.
 An
Attributes
object returned by any method is owned by
 the caller.  The caller may subsequently modify it; the service
 provider will not.
Exceptions
All the methods in this interface can throw a NamingException or
 any of its subclasses. See NamingException and their subclasses
 for details on each exception.

ADD_ATTRIBUTE
static final
int
ADD_ATTRIBUTE
This constant specifies to add an attribute with the specified values.
If attribute does not exist,
 create the attribute.  The resulting attribute has a union of the
 specified value set and the prior value set.
 Adding an attribute with no value will throw
InvalidAttributeValueException
if the attribute must have
 at least  one value.  For a single-valued attribute where that attribute
 already exists, throws
AttributeInUseException
.
 If attempting to add more than one value to a single-valued attribute,
 throws
InvalidAttributeValueException
.
The value of this constant is

REPLACE_ATTRIBUTE
static final
int
REPLACE_ATTRIBUTE
This constant specifies to replace an attribute with specified values.
If attribute already exists,
 replaces all existing values with new specified values.  If the
 attribute does not exist, creates it.  If no value is specified,
 deletes all the values of the attribute.
 Removal of the last value will remove the attribute if the attribute
 is required to have at least one value.  If
 attempting to add more than one value to a single-valued attribute,
 throws
InvalidAttributeValueException
.

REMOVE_ATTRIBUTE
static final
int
REMOVE_ATTRIBUTE
This constant specifies to delete
 the specified attribute values from the attribute.
The resulting attribute has the set difference of its prior value set
 and the specified value set.
 If no values are specified, deletes the entire attribute.
 If the attribute does not exist, or if some or all members of the
 specified value set do not exist, this absence may be ignored
 and the operation succeeds, or a NamingException may be thrown to
 indicate the absence.
 Removal of the last value will remove the attribute if the
 attribute is required to have at least one value.

createSubcontext
(
Name
name,
Attributes
attrs)
throws
NamingException
Creates and binds a new context, along with associated attributes.
 This method creates a new subcontext with the given name, binds it in
 the target context (that named by all but terminal atomic
 component of the name), and associates the supplied attributes
 with the newly created object.
 All intermediate and target contexts must already exist.
 If
attrs

getSchema
DirContext
getSchema
(
Name
name)
throws
NamingException
Retrieves the schema associated with the named object.
 The schema describes rules regarding the structure of the namespace
 and the attributes stored within it.  The schema
 specifies what types of objects can be added to the directory and where
 they can be added; what mandatory and optional attributes an object
 can have. The range of support for schemas is directory-specific.
This method returns the root of the schema information tree
 that is applicable to the named object. Several named objects
 (or even an entire directory) might share the same schema.
Issues such as structure and contents of the schema tree,
 permission to modify to the contents of the schema
 tree, and the effect of such modifications on the directory
 are dependent on the underlying directory.
Parameters:
name
- the name of the object whose schema is to be retrieved
Returns:
the schema associated with the context; never null
Throws:
OperationNotSupportedException
- if schema not supported
NamingException
- if a naming exception is encountered
getSchema
DirContext
getSchema
(
String
name)
throws
NamingException
Retrieves the schema associated with the named object.
 See
getSchema(Name)
for details.
Parameters:
name
- the name of the object whose schema is to be retrieved
Returns:
the schema associated with the context; never null
Throws:
OperationNotSupportedException
- if schema not supported
NamingException
- if a naming exception is encountered
getSchemaClassDefinition
DirContext
getSchemaClassDefinition
(
Name
name)
throws
NamingException
Retrieves a context containing the schema objects of the
 named object's class definitions.
One category of information found in directory schemas is
class definitions
.  An "object class" definition
 specifies the object's
type
and what attributes (mandatory
 and optional) the object must/can have. Note that the term
 "object class" being referred to here is in the directory sense
 rather than in the Java sense.
 For example, if the named object is a directory object of
 "Person" class,
getSchemaClassDefinition()
would return a
DirContext
representing the (directory's) object class
 definition of "Person".
The information that can be retrieved from an object class definition
 is directory-dependent.
Prior to JNDI 1.2, this method

throws
NamingException
Searches in a single context for objects that contain a
 specified set of attributes, and retrieves selected attributes.
 The search is performed using the default
SearchControls
settings.
For an object to be selected, each attribute in
matchingAttributes
must match some attribute of the
 object.  If
matchingAttributes
is empty or
 null, all objects in the target context are returned.
An attribute
A
1
in
matchingAttributes
is considered to match an
 attribute
A
2
of an object if
A
1
and
A
2
have the same
 identifier, and each value of
A
1
is equal
 to some value of
A
2
.  This implies that the
 order of values is not significant, and that
A
2
may contain "extra" values not found in
A
1
without affecting the comparison.  It
 also implies that if
A
1
has no values, then
 testing for a match is equivalent to testing for the presence
 of an attribute
A
2
with the same
 identifier.
The precise definition of "equality" used in comparing attribute values
 is defined by the underlying directory service.  It might use the
Object.equals
method, for example, or might use a schema
 to specify a different equality operation.
 For matching based on operations other than equality (such as
 substring comparison) use the version of the
search
method that takes a filter argument.
When changes are made to this
DirContext
,
 the effect on enumerations returned by prior calls to this method
 is undefined.
If the object does not have the attribute
 specified, the directory will ignore the nonexistent attribute
 and return the requested attributes that the object does have.
A directory might return more attributes than was requested
 (see
Attribute Type Names
in the class description),
 but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.

Parameters:
name
- the name of the context to search
matchingAttributes
- the attributes to search for.  If empty or null,
          all objects in the target context are returned.
attributesToReturn
- the attributes to return.  null indicates that
          all attributes are to be returned;
          an empty array indicates that none are to be returned.
Returns:
a non-null enumeration of
SearchResult
objects.
          Each
SearchResult
contains the attributes
          identified by
attributesToReturn
and the name of the corresponding object, named relative
          to the context named by

filter,

throws
NamingException
Searches in the named context or object for entries that satisfy the
 given search filter.  Performs the search as specified by
 the search controls.
The format and interpretation of
filter
follows RFC 2254
 with the
 following interpretations for
attr
and
value
mentioned in the RFC.
attr
is the attribute's identifier.
value
is the string representation the attribute's value.
 The translation of this string representation into the attribute's value
 is directory-specific.
For the assertion "someCount=127", for example,
attr
is "someCount" and
value
is "127".
 The provider determines, based on the attribute ID ("someCount")
 (and possibly its schema), that the attribute's value is an integer.
 It then parses the string "127" appropriately.
Any non-ASCII characters in the filter string should be
 represented by the appropriate Java (Unicode) characters, and
 not encoded as UTF-8 octets.  Alternately, the
 "backslash-hexcode" notation described in RFC 2254 may be used.
If the directory does not support a string representation of
 some or all of its attributes, the form of
search
that
 accepts filter arguments in the form of Objects can be used instead.
 The service provider for such a directory would then translate
 the filter arguments to its service-specific representation
 for filter evaluation.
 See
search(Name, String, Object[], SearchControls)
.
RFC 2254 defines certain operators for the filter, including substring
 matches, equality, approximate match, greater than, less than.  These
 operators are mapped to operators with corresponding semantics in the
 underlying directory. For example, for the equals operator, suppose
 the directory has a matching rule defining "equality" of the
 attributes in the filter. This rule would be used for checking
 equality of the attributes specified in the filter with the attributes
 of objects in the directory. Similarly, if the directory has a
 matching rule for ordering, this rule would be used for
 making "greater than" and "less than" comparisons.
Not all of the operators defined in RFC 2254 are applicable to all
 attributes.  When an operator is not applicable, the exception
InvalidSearchFilterException
is thrown.
The result is returned in an enumeration of
SearchResult
s.
 Each
SearchResult
contains the name of the object
 and other information about the object (see SearchResult).
 The name is either relative to the target context of the search
 (which is named by the
name
parameter), or
 it is a URL string. If the target context is included in
 the enumeration (as is possible when
cons
specifies a search scope of
SearchControls.OBJECT_SCOPE
or
SearchControls.SUBSTREE_SCOPE
), its name is the empty
 string. The
SearchResult
may also contain attributes of the
 matching object if the
cons
argument specified that attributes
 be returned.
If the object does not have a requested attribute, that
 nonexistent attribute will be ignored.  Those requested
 attributes that the object does have will be returned.
A directory might return more attributes than were requested
 (see
Attribute Type Names
in the class description)
 but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.

name
- the name of the context or object to search

throws
NamingException
Searches in the named context or object for entries that satisfy the
 given search filter.  Performs the search as specified by
 the search controls.
The interpretation of
filterExpr
is based on RFC
 2254.  It may additionally contain variables of the form
{i}
-- where
i
is an integer -- that
 refer to objects in the
filterArgs
array.  The
 interpretation of
filterExpr
is otherwise
 identical to that of the
filter
parameter of the
 method
search(Name, String, SearchControls)
.
When a variable
{i}
appears in a search filter, it
 indicates that the filter argument
filterArgs[i]
is to be used in that place.  Such variables may be used
 wherever an
attr
,
value
, or
matchingrule
production appears in the filter grammar
 of RFC 2254, section 4.  When a string-valued filter argument
 is substituted for a variable, the filter is interpreted as if
 the string were given in place of the variable, with any
 characters having special significance within filters (such as
'*'
) having been escaped according to the rules of
 RFC 2254.
For directories that do not use a string representation for
 some or all of their attributes, the filter argument
 corresponding to an attribute value may be of a type other than
 String.  Directories that support unstructured binary-valued
 attributes, for example, should accept byte arrays as filter
 arguments.  The interpretation (if any) of filter arguments of
 any other type is determined by the service provider for that
 directory, which maps the filter operations onto operations with
 corresponding semantics in the underlying directory.
This method returns an enumeration of the results.
 Each element in the enumeration contains the name of the object
 and other information about the object (see
SearchResult
).
 The name is either relative to the target context of the search
 (which is named by the
name
parameter), or
 it is a URL string. If the target context is included in
 the enumeration (as is possible when
cons
specifies a search scope of
SearchControls.OBJECT_SCOPE
or
SearchControls.SUBSTREE_SCOPE
),
 its name is the empty string.
The
SearchResult
may also contain attributes of the matching
 object if the
cons
argument specifies that attributes be
 returned.
If the object does not have a requested attribute, that
 nonexistent attribute will be ignored.  Those requested
 attributes that the object does have will be returned.
A directory might return more attributes than were requested
 (see
Attribute Type Names
in the class description)
 but is not allowed to return arbitrary, unrelated attributes.
If a search filter with invalid variable substitutions is provided
 to this method, the result is undefined.
 When changes are made to this DirContext,
 the effect on enumerations returned by prior calls to this method
 is undefined.
