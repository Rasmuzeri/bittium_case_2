All Implemented Interfaces:

public class
SearchResult
extends
Binding
This class represents an item in the NamingEnumeration returned as a
 result of the DirContext.search() methods.
A SearchResult instance is not synchronized against concurrent
 multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify
 a single SearchResult instance should lock the object.
Since:
1.3
