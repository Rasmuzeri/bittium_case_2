public class
Binding
extends
NameClassPair
This class represents a name-to-object binding found in a context.
A context consists of name-to-object bindings.
 The Binding class represents such a binding.  It consists
 of a name and an object. The
Context.listBindings()
method returns an enumeration of Binding.
Use subclassing for naming systems that generate contents of
 a binding dynamically.
A Binding instance is not synchronized against concurrent access by multiple
 threads. Threads that need to access a Binding concurrently should
 synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking.

Constructor Details
Binding
public
Binding
(
String
name,
Object
obj)
Constructs an instance of a Binding given its name and object.
getClassName()
will return
 the class name of
obj
(or null if
obj
is null)
 unless the class name has been explicitly set using
setClassName()
Parameters:
name
- The non-null name of the object. It is relative
             to the
target context
(which is
 named by the first parameter of the
listBindings()
method)
obj
- The possibly null object bound to name.
See Also:
NameClassPair.setClassName(java.lang.String)
Binding
public
Binding
(
String
name,
Object
obj,
 boolean isRelative)
Constructs an instance of a Binding given its name, object, and whether
 the name is relative.
getClassName()
will return the class name of
obj
(or null if
obj
is null) unless the class name has been
 explicitly set using
setClassName()
Parameters:
name
- The non-null string name of the object.
obj
- The possibly null object bound to name.
isRelative
- true if
name
is a name relative
         to the target context (which is named by
         the first parameter of the
listBindings()
method);
         false if
name
is a URL string.

Binding
public
Binding
(
String
name,
String
className,
Object
obj)
Constructs an instance of a Binding given its name, class name, and object.
Parameters:
name
- The non-null name of the object. It is relative
             to the
target context
(which is
 named by the first parameter of the
listBindings()
method)
className
- The possibly null class name of the object
         bound to
name
. If null, the class name of
obj
is
         returned by
getClassName()
. If
obj
is also
         null,
getClassName()
will return null.
obj
- The possibly null object bound to name.
See Also:
NameClassPair.setClassName(java.lang.String)
Binding
public
Binding
(
String
name,
String
className,
Object
obj,
 boolean isRelative)
Constructs an instance of a Binding given its
 name, class name, object, and whether the name is relative.
Parameters:
name
- The non-null string name of the object.
className
- The possibly null class name of the object
         bound to
name
. If null, the class name of
obj
is
         returned by
getClassName()
. If
obj
is also
         null,
getClassName()
will return null.
obj
- The possibly null object bound to name.
isRelative
- true if
name
is a name relative
         to the target context (which is named by
         the first parameter of the
listBindings()
method);
         false if
name
is a URL string.

Method Details
getClassName
public
String
getClassName
()
Retrieves the class name of the object bound to the name of this binding.
 If the class name has been set explicitly, return it.
 Otherwise, if this binding contains a non-null object,
 that object's class name is used. Otherwise, null is returned.
Overrides:
getClassName
in class
NameClassPair
Returns:
A possibly null string containing class name of object bound.
See Also:
getObject()
getClassName()
NameClassPair.setClassName(java.lang.String)
getObject
public
Object
getObject
()
Retrieves the object bound to the name of this binding.
Returns:
The object bound; null if this binding does not contain an object.
See Also:
setObject(java.lang.Object)
setObject
public
void
setObject
(
Object
obj)
Sets the object associated with this binding.
Parameters:
obj
- The possibly null object to use.
See Also:
getObject()
toString
public
String
toString
()
Generates the string representation of this binding.
 The string representation consists of the string representation
 of the name/class pair and the string representation of
 this binding's object, separated by ':'.
 The contents of this string is useful
 for debugging and is not meant to be interpreted programmatically.
Overrides:
toString
in class
NameClassPair
Returns:
The non-null string representation of this binding.
