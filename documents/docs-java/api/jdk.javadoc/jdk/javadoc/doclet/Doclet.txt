Interface Doclet
All Known Implementing Classes:
StandardDoclet
public interface
Doclet
The user doclet must implement this interface, as described in the
package description
.
 Each implementation of a Doclet must provide a public no-argument constructor
 to be used by tools to instantiate the doclet. The tool infrastructure will
 interact with classes implementing this interface as follows:
The tool will create an instance of a doclet using the no-arg constructor
  of the doclet class.
Next, the tool calls the
init
method with an appropriate locale
  and reporter.
Afterwards, the tool calls
getSupportedOptions
,
 and
getSupportedSourceVersion
.
 These methods are only called once.
As appropriate, the tool calls the
run
method on the doclet
 object, giving it a DocletEnvironment object, from which the doclet can determine
 the elements to be included in the documentation.
If a doclet object is created and used without the above protocol being followed,
 then the doclet's behavior is not defined by this interface specification.
To start the doclet, pass
-doclet
followed by the fully-qualified
 name of the entry point class (i.e. the implementation of this interface) on
 the javadoc tool command line.
