Interface Taglet
public interface
Taglet
The interface for a custom taglet supported by doclets such as
 the
standard doclet
.
 Custom taglets are used to handle custom tags in documentation
 comments; custom tags can be instantiated individually as either
block tags
, which appear at the end of a comment,
 or
inline tags
, which can appear within the main body of a
 documentation comment.
Each implementation of a taglet must provide a public no-argument constructor
 to be used by doclets to instantiate the taglet. A doclet will interact
 with classes implementing this interface as follows:
The doclet will create an instance of a taglet using the no-arg
      constructor of the taglet class.
Next, the doclet calls the
init
method with an appropriate environment and doclet.
Afterwards, the doclet calls
getName
,
getAllowedLocations
, and
isInlineTag
, to determine the characteristics
      of the tags supported by the taglet.
As appropriate, the doclet calls the
toString
method on the taglet object,
      giving it a list of tags and the element for which the tags are part
      of the element's documentation comment, from which the taglet can
      determine the string to be included in the documentation.
      The doclet will typically specify any requirements on the contents of
      the string that is returned.
If a taglet object is created and used without the above protocol being
 followed, then the taglet's behavior is not defined by this interface
 specification.
API Note:
It is typical for a taglet to be designed to work in conjunction with a
 specific doclet.

Method Details
getAllowedLocations

<
Taglet.Location

getAllowedLocations
()
Returns the set of supported locations for block tags.
Returns:
the set of supported locations for block tags
isInlineTag
boolean
isInlineTag
()
Indicates whether this taglet supports inline tags.
Returns:
true if this taglet supports inline tags
isBlockTag
default
boolean
isBlockTag
()
Indicates whether this taglet supports block tags.
Implementation Requirements:
This implementation returns the inverse
 result to
isInlineTag
.
Returns:
true if this taglet supports block tags
getName
String
getName
()
Returns the name of the tag supported by this taglet.
Returns:
the name of this tag

DocletEnvironment
env,
Doclet
doclet)
Initializes this taglet with the given doclet environment and doclet.
API Note:
The environment may be used to access utility classes for
elements
and
types
if needed.
Implementation Requirements:
This implementation does nothing.
Parameters:
env
- the environment in which the doclet and taglet are running
doclet
- the doclet that instantiated this taglet
toString
String
toString
(
List
<? extends
DocTree
> tags,
Element
element)
Returns the string representation of a series of instances of
 this tag to be included in the generated output.
If this taglet supports
inline
tags, it will
 be called once per instance of the inline tag, each time with a singleton list.
 If this taglet supports
block
tags, it will be called once
 for each comment containing instances of block tags, with a list of all the instances
 of the block tag in that comment.
Parameters:
tags
- the list of instances of this tag
element
- the element to which the enclosing comment belongs
Returns:
the string representation of the tags to be included in
  the generated output
