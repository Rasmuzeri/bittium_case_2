Package javax.xml.crypto.dsig
package
javax.xml.crypto.dsig
Classes for generating and validating XML digital
 signatures. This package includes classes that represent the core elements
 defined in the W3C XML digital signature specification:
XMLSignature
,
SignedInfo
,
CanonicalizationMethod
,
SignatureMethod
,
Reference
,
DigestMethod
,
XMLObject
,
Manifest
,
SignatureProperties
, and
SignatureProperty
.
KeyInfo
types are defined in the
javax.xml.crypto.dsig.keyinfo
subpackage.
XMLSignatureFactory
is an abstract factory that creates
XMLSignature
objects from scratch
 or from a pre-existing XML representation, such as a DOM node.
TransformService
is a service provider
 interface for creating and plugging in implementations of
 transform and canonicalization algorithms.
Of primary significance in this package is the
XMLSignature
class,
 which allows you to sign and validate an XML digital signature.
Service Providers
A service provider is a concrete implementation of the abstract
XMLSignatureFactory
and
KeyInfoFactory
classes
 and is responsible for creating objects and algorithms that parse, generate
 and validate XML Signatures and KeyInfo structures. A concrete implementation
 of
XMLSignatureFactory
MUST provide support for each of the REQUIRED
 algorithms as specified by the W3C recommendation for XML Signatures. It MAY
 support other algorithms as defined by the W3C recommendation or other
 specifications.
The API leverages the JCA provider model (see
the Provider class
) for registering and
 loading
XMLSignatureFactory
and
KeyInfoFactory
implementations.
Each concrete
XMLSignatureFactory
or
KeyInfoFactory
implementation supports a specific XML mechanism type that identifies the XML
 processing mechanism that an implementation uses internally to parse and
 generate XML signature and KeyInfo structures.
A service provider implementation SHOULD use underlying JCA engine
 classes, such as
Signature
and
MessageDigest
to perform cryptographic operations.
In addition to the
XMLSignatureFactory
and
KeyInfoFactory
classes, the API supports a service provider interface for transform and
 canonicalization algorithms. The
TransformService
class allows you to
 develop and plug in an implementation of a specific transform or
 canonicalization algorithm for a particular XML mechanism type. The
TransformService
class uses the standard JCA provider model for registering
 and loading implementations. Each service provider implementation SHOULD use
 the
TransformService
class to find a provider that supports transform
 and canonicalization algorithms in XML Signatures that it is generating or
 validating.
DOM Mechanism Requirements
The following requirements MUST be abided by when implementing a DOM-based
XMLSignatureFactory
,
KeyInfoFactory
or
TransformService
in order to minimize interoperability problems:
The
unmarshalXMLSignature
method of
XMLSignatureFactory
MUST support
DOMValidateContext
types. If the type is
DOMValidateContext
, it SHOULD contain an
Element
of type
 Signature. Additionally, the
unmarshalXMLSignature
method MAY
 populate the Id/Element mappings of the passed-in
DOMValidateContext
.
The
sign
method of
XMLSignature
s produced by
XMLSignatureFactory
MUST support
DOMSignContext
types and the
validate
method MUST support
DOMValidateContext
types. This
 requirement also applies to the
validate
method of
SignatureValue
and the
validate
method of
Reference
.
The implementation MUST support
DOMStructure
s as the mechanism
 for the application to specify extensible content (any elements or mixed
 content).
If the
dereference
method of user-specified
URIDereferencer
s returns
NodeSetData
objects, the
iterator
method MUST return an iteration over objects of type
org.w3c.dom.Node
.
URIReference
objects passed to the
dereference
method of
 user-specified
URIDereferencer
s MUST be of type
DOMURIReference
and
XMLCryptoContext
objects MUST implement
DOMCryptoContext
.
The previous 2 requirements also apply to
URIDereferencer
s
 returned by the
getURIDereferencer
method of
XMLSignatureFactory
and
KeyInfoFactory
.
The
unmarshalKeyInfo
method of
KeyInfoFactory
MUST
 support
DOMStructure
types. If the type is
DOMStructure
, it
 SHOULD contain an
Element
of type
KeyInfo
.
The
transform
method of
Transform
MUST support
DOMCryptoContext
context parameter types.
The
newtransform
and
newCanonicalizationMethod
methods of
XMLSignatureFactory
MUST support
DOMStructure
parameter
 types.
The
init
, and
marshalParams
methods of
TransformService
MUST support
DOMStructure
and
DOMCryptoContext
types.
The
unmarshalXMLSignature
method of
XMLSignatureFactory
MUST support
DOMStructure
types. If the type is
DOMStructure
,
 it SHOULD contain an
Element
of type
Signature
.
The
marshal
method of
KeyInfo
MUST support
DOMStructure
and
DOMCryptoContext
parameter types.
Note that a DOM implementation MAY internally use other XML parsing APIs
 other than DOM as long as it doesn't affect interoperability. For example, a
 DOM implementation of
XMLSignatureFactory
might use a SAX parser
 internally to canonicalize data.
