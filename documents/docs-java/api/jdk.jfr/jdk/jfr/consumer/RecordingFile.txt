readAllEvents
(
Path
path)
throws
IOException
Returns a list of all events in a file.
This method is intended for simple cases where it's convenient to read all
 events in a single operation. It isn't intended for reading large files.
Only recording files from trusted sources should be used.
Parameters:
path
- the path to the file, not
null
Returns:
the events from the file as a
List
object; whether the
List
is modifiable or not is implementation dependent and
         therefore not specified, not
null
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurred, it's not a Flight Recorder
         file or a version of a JFR file that can't be parsed
SecurityException
- if a security manager exists and its
checkRead
method denies read access to the file.
