class.
Copy
try (Recording r = new Recording()) {
    r.enable("jdk.CPULoad")
     .withPeriod(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
    r.enable("jdk.FileWrite")
     .withoutStackTrace()
     .withThreshold(Duration.ofNanos(10));
    r.start();
    Thread.sleep(10_000);
    r.stop();
    r.dump(Files.createTempFile("recording", ".jfr"));
