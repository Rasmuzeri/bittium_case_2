SettingDefinition
Annotation that specifies that a method in an event class should be used to
 filter out events.
For the method to be valid it must return a
SettingControl
and only have one
 parameter, which should be a non-abstract subclass of
SettingControl
The return value of the method specifies whether the event is to be
 written to the Flight Recorder system or not.
The following example shows how to annotate a method in an event class.
class HelloWorld extends Event {

   @Label("Message")
   String message;

   @SettingDefinition
   @Label("Message Filter")
   public boolean filter(RegExpControl regExp) {
     return regExp.matches(message);
   }
 }
For an example of how the setting controls are defined, see
SettingControl
.
