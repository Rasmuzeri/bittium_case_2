Permission Target Name
What the Permission Allows
Risks of Allowing this Permission
accessFlightRecorder
Ability to create a Flight Recorder instance, register callbacks to
 monitor the Flight Recorder life cycle, and control an existing instance
 of Flight Recorder, which can record and dump runtime information, such as
 stack traces, class names, and data in user defined events.
A malicious user may be able to extract sensitive information that is stored in
 events and interrupt Flight Recorder by installing listeners or hooks that
 never finish.
registerEvent
Ability to register events, write data to the Flight Recorder buffers,
 and execute code in a callback function for periodic events.
A malicious user may be able to write sensitive information to Flight
 Recorder buffers.
Typically, programmers do not create
FlightRecorderPermission
objects
 directly. Instead the objects are created by the security policy code that is based on
 reading the security policy file.
