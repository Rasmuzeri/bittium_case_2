Method Details
recorderInitialized
default
void
recorderInitialized
(
FlightRecorder
recorder)
Receives notification when Flight Recorder is initialized.
This method is also be invoked when a listener is added to an already
 initialized Flight Recorder.
This method allows clients to implement their own initialization mechanism
 that is executed before a
FlightRecorder
instance is returned by
FlightRecorder.getFlightRecorder()
.
Implementation Requirements:
The default implementation of this method is empty.
Implementation Note:
This method should return as soon as possible, to avoid blocking
           initialization of Flight Recorder. To avoid deadlocks or unexpected
           behavior, this method should not call
FlightRecorder.getFlightRecorder()
or start new recordings.
Parameters:
recorder
- Flight Recorder instance, not
null

and

Implementation Requirements:
The default implementation of this method is empty.
Implementation Note:
The implementation of this method should return as soon as possible
           to avoid blocking normal operation of Flight Recorder.

null
