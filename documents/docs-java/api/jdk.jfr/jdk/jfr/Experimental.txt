Experimental
Annotation that specifies that an element is experimental and may change
 without notice.
Clients that visualize Flight Recorder events should
not
show the
 events or fields annotated with the
Experimental
annotation by
 default. This annotation allows event producers the freedom to try out new
 events without committing to them.
Clients may provide a check box (for example, in a preference page) where a
 user can opt-in to display experimental data. If the user decide to do so,
 the user interface should mark experimental events or fields so users can
 distinguish them from non-experimental events.
This annotation is inherited.
