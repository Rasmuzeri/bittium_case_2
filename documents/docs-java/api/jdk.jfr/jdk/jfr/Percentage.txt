Percentage
Event field annotation to use on fractions, typically between
0.0
and
1.0
, to specify that the value is a percentage.
For example, a field with the value
0.5
annotated by this annotation,
 should be interpreted as
50%
and rendered in a graphical user
 interface with a percentage sign to avoid confusion with
0.005%
.
