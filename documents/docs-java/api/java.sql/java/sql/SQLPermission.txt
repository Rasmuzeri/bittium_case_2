All Implemented Interfaces:

public final class
SQLPermission
extends
BasicPermission
The permission for which the
SecurityManager
will check
 when code that is running an application with a
SecurityManager
enabled, calls the
DriverManager.deregisterDriver
method,
DriverManager.setLogWriter
method,
DriverManager.setLogStream
(deprecated) method,
SyncFactory.setJNDIContext
method,
SyncFactory.setLogger
method,
Connection.setNetworkTimeout
method,
 or the
Connection.abort
method.
 If there is no
SQLPermission
object, these methods
 throw a
java.lang.SecurityException
as a runtime exception.
A
SQLPermission
object contains
 a name (also referred to as a "target name") but no actions
 list; there is either a named permission or there is not.
 The target name is the name of the permission (see below). The
 naming convention follows the  hierarchical property naming convention.
 In addition, an asterisk
 may appear at the end of the name, following a ".", or by itself, to
 signify a wildcard match. For example:
loadLibrary.*
and
*
signify a wildcard match,
 while
*loadLibrary
and
a*b
do not.
The following table lists all the possible
SQLPermission
target names.
 The table gives a description of what the permission allows
 and a discussion of the risks of granting code the permission.
permission target name, what the permission allows, and associated risks

What the Permission Allows
Risks of Allowing this Permission
setLog
Setting of the logging stream
This is a dangerous permission to grant.
 The contents of the log may contain usernames and passwords,
 SQL statements, and SQL data.

Allows the invocation of the
Connection
method
abort
Permits an application to terminate a physical connection to a
  database.
setSyncFactory
Allows the invocation of the
SyncFactory
methods
setJNDIContext
and
setLogger
Permits an application to specify the JNDI context from which the
SyncProvider
implementations can be retrieved from and the logging
   object to be used by the
SyncProvider
implementation.
setNetworkTimeout
Allows the invocation of the
Connection
method
setNetworkTimeout
Permits an application to specify the maximum period a
Connection
or
 objects created from the
Connection
will wait for the database to reply to any one request.
deregisterDriver
Allows the invocation of the
DriverManager
method
deregisterDriver
Permits an application to remove a JDBC driver from the list of
 registered Drivers and release its resources.
