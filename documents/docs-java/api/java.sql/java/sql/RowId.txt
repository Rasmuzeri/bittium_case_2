Interface RowId
public interface
RowId
The representation (mapping) in the Java programming language of an SQL ROWID
 value. An SQL ROWID is a built-in type, a value of which can be thought of as
 an address  for its identified row in a database table. Whether that address
 is logical or, in any  respects, physical is determined by its originating data
 source.
Methods in the interfaces
ResultSet
,
CallableStatement
,
 and
PreparedStatement
, such as
getRowId
and
setRowId
allow a programmer to access a SQL
ROWID
value. The
RowId
interface provides a method
 for representing the value of the
ROWID
as a byte array or as a
String
.
The method
getRowIdLifetime
in the interface
DatabaseMetaData
,
 can be used
 to determine if a
RowId
object remains valid for the duration of the transaction in
 which  the
RowId
was created, the duration of the session in which
 the
RowId
was created,
 or, effectively, for as long as its identified row is not deleted. In addition
 to specifying the duration of its valid lifetime outside its originating data
 source,
getRowIdLifetime
specifies the duration of a
ROWID
value's valid lifetime
 within its originating data source. In this, it differs from a large object,
 because there is no limit on the valid lifetime of a large  object within its
 originating data source.
All methods on the
RowId
interface must be fully implemented if the
 JDBC driver supports the data type.

Modifier and Type
Method
Description
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Compares this
RowId
to the specified object.
byte[]
getBytes
()
Returns an array of bytes representing the value of the SQL
ROWID
designated by this
java.sql.RowId
object.
int
hashCode
()
Returns a hash code value of this
RowId
object.
String
toString
()
Returns a String representing the value of the SQL ROWID designated by this
java.sql.RowId
object.
Method Details
equals
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Compares this
RowId
to the specified object. The result is
true
if and only if the argument is not null and is a RowId
 object that represents the same ROWID as  this object.
It is important
 to consider both the origin and the valid lifetime of a
RowId
when comparing it to another
RowId
. If both are valid, and
 both are from the same table on the same data source, then if they are equal
 they identify
 the same row; if one or more is no longer guaranteed to be valid, or if
 they originate from different data sources, or different tables on the
 same data source, they  may be equal but still
 not identify the same row.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- the
Object
to compare this
RowId
object
     against.
Returns:
true if the
RowId
s are equal; false otherwise

HashMap
getBytes
byte[]
getBytes
()
Returns an array of bytes representing the value of the SQL
ROWID
designated by this
java.sql.RowId
object.
Returns:
an array of bytes, whose length is determined by the driver supplying
     the connection, representing the value of the ROWID designated by this
     java.sql.RowId object.
toString
String
toString
()
Returns a String representing the value of the SQL ROWID designated by this
java.sql.RowId
object.
Like
java.sql.Date.toString()
returns the contents of its DATE as the
String
"2004-03-17"
 rather than as  DATE literal in SQL (which would have been the
String
DATE "2004-03-17"), toString()
 returns the contents of its ROWID in a form specific to the driver supplying
 the connection, and possibly not as a
ROWID
literal.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
a String whose format is determined by the driver supplying the
     connection, representing the value of the
ROWID
designated
     by this
java.sql.RowId
object.
hashCode
int
hashCode
()
Returns a hash code value of this
RowId
object.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
a hash code for the
RowId
