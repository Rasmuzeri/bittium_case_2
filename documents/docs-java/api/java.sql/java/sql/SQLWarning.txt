public class
SQLWarning
extends
SQLException
An exception that provides information on  database access
 warnings. Warnings are silently chained to the object whose method
 caused it to be reported.
Warnings may be retrieved from
Connection
,
Statement
,
 and
ResultSet
objects.  Trying to retrieve a warning on a
 connection after it has been closed will cause an exception to be thrown.
 Similarly, trying to retrieve a warning on a statement after it has been
 closed or on a result set after it has been closed will cause
 an exception to be thrown. Note that closing a statement also
 closes a result set that it might have produced.
Since:
1.1
