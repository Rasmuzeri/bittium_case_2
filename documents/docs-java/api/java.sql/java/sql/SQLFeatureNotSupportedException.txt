 This indicates that the JDBC driver does not support an optional JDBC feature.
 Optional JDBC features can fall into the following categories:
no support for an optional feature
no support for an optional overloaded method
no support for an optional mode for a method.  The mode for a method is
determined based on constants passed as parameter values to a method
