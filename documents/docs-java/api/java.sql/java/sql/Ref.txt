Interface Ref
All Known Implementing Classes:
SerialRef
public interface
Ref
The mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL
REF
value, which is a reference to an SQL structured type value in the database.
SQL
REF
values are stored in a table that contains
 instances of a referenceable SQL structured type, and each
REF
value is a unique identifier for one instance in that table.
 An SQL
REF
value may be used in place of the
 SQL structured type it references, either as a column value in a
 table or an attribute value in a structured type.
Because an SQL
REF
value is a logical pointer to an
 SQL structured type, a
Ref
object is by default also a logical
 pointer. Thus, retrieving an SQL
REF
value as
 a
Ref
object does not materialize
 the attributes of the structured type on the client.
A
Ref
object can be stored in the database using the
PreparedStatement.setRef
method.
All methods on the
Ref
interface must be fully implemented if the
 JDBC driver supports the data type.

Method
Description
String
getBaseTypeName
()
Retrieves the fully-qualified SQL name of the SQL structured type that
 this
Ref
object references.

()
Retrieves the SQL structured type instance referenced by
 this
Ref
object.

Retrieves the referenced object and maps it to a Java type
 using the given type map.
void

value)
Sets the structured type value that this
Ref
object references to the given instance of
Object
.
Method Details
getBaseTypeName
String
getBaseTypeName
()
                throws
SQLException
Retrieves the fully-qualified SQL name of the SQL structured type that
 this
Ref
object references.
Returns:
the fully-qualified SQL name of the referenced SQL structured type
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
- if the JDBC driver does not support
 this method
Since:
1.2
getObject
Object
getObject
(
Map
<
String
,
Class
<?>> map)
throws
SQLException
Retrieves the referenced object and maps it to a Java type
 using the given type map.
Parameters:
map
- a
java.util.Map
object that contains
        the mapping to use (the fully-qualified name of the SQL
        structured type being referenced and the class object for
SQLData
implementation to which the SQL
        structured type will be mapped)
Returns:
a Java
Object
that is the custom mapping for
          the SQL structured type to which this
Ref
object refers
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
- if the JDBC driver does not support
 this method
Since:
1.4

setObject(java.lang.Object)
getObject
Object
getObject
()
          throws
SQLException
Retrieves the SQL structured type instance referenced by
 this
Ref
object.  If the connection's type map has an entry
 for the structured type, the instance will be custom mapped to
 the Java class indicated in the type map.  Otherwise, the
 structured type instance will be mapped to a
Struct
object.
Returns:
a Java
Object
that is the mapping for
          the SQL structured type to which this
Ref
object refers
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
- if the JDBC driver does not support
 this method
Since:
1.4
See Also:
setObject(java.lang.Object)
setObject
void
setObject
(
Object
value)
throws
SQLException
Sets the structured type value that this
Ref
object references to the given instance of
Object
.
 The driver converts this to an SQL structured type when it
 sends it to the database.
Parameters:
value
- an
Object
representing the SQL
        structured type instance that this
Ref
object will reference
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
- if the JDBC driver does not support
 this method

1.4
