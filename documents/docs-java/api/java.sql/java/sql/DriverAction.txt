Interface DriverAction
public interface
DriverAction
An interface that must be implemented when a
Driver
wants to be
 notified by
DriverManager
.
A
DriverAction
implementation is not intended to be used
 directly by applications. A JDBC Driver  may choose
 to create its
DriverAction
implementation in a private class
 to avoid it being called directly.
The JDBC driver's static initialization block must call
DriverManager.registerDriver(java.sql.Driver, java.sql.DriverAction)
in order
 to inform
DriverManager
which
DriverAction
implementation to
 call when the JDBC driver is de-registered.
Since:
1.8

Method Details
deregister
void
deregister
()
Method called by
DriverManager.deregisterDriver(Driver)
to notify the JDBC driver that it was de-registered.
The
deregister
method is intended only to be used by JDBC Drivers
 and not by applications.  JDBC drivers are recommended to not implement
DriverAction
in a public class.  If there are active
 connections to the database at the time that the
deregister
method is called, it is implementation specific as to whether the
 connections are closed or allowed to continue. Once this method is
 called, it is implementation specific as to whether the driver may
 limit the ability to create new connections to the database, invoke
 other
Driver
methods or throw a
SQLException
.
 Consult your JDBC driver's documentation for additional information
 on its behavior.
Since:
1.8
