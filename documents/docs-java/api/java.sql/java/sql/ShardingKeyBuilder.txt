Interface ShardingKeyBuilder
public interface
ShardingKeyBuilder
A builder created from a
DataSource
or
XADataSource
object,
 used to create a
ShardingKey
with sub-keys of supported data types.
 Implementations must
 support JDBCType.VARCHAR and  may also support additional data types.
The following example illustrates the use of
ShardingKeyBuilder
to
 create a
ShardingKey
:
DataSource ds = new MyDataSource();
     ShardingKey shardingKey = ds.createShardingKeyBuilder()
                           .subkey("abc", JDBCType.VARCHAR)
                           .subkey(94002, JDBCType.INTEGER)
                           .build();
