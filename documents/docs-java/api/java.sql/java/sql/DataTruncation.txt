DataTruncation
public
DataTruncation
(int index,
 boolean parameter,
 boolean read,
 int dataSize,
 int transferSize)
Creates a
DataTruncation
object
 with the SQLState initialized
 to 01004 when
read
is set to
true
and 22001
 when
read
is set to
false
,
 the reason set to "Data truncation", the
 vendor code set to 0, and
 the other fields set to the given values.
 The
cause
is not initialized, and may subsequently be
 initialized by a call to the
Throwable.initCause(java.lang.Throwable)
method.
Parameters:
index
- The index of the parameter or column value
parameter
- true if a parameter value was truncated
read
- true if a read was truncated
dataSize
- the original size of the data
transferSize
- the size after truncation
DataTruncation
public
DataTruncation
(int index,
 boolean parameter,
 boolean read,
 int dataSize,
 int transferSize,
Throwable
cause)
Creates a
DataTruncation
object

 to 01004 when
read
is set to
true
and 22001
 when
read
is set to
false
,
 the reason set to "Data truncation", the
 vendor code set to 0, and
 the other fields set to the given values.
Parameters:
index
- The index of the parameter or column value
parameter
- true if a parameter value was truncated
read
- true if a read was truncated
dataSize
- the original size of the data
transferSize
- the size after truncation
cause
- the underlying reason for this
DataTruncation
(which is saved for later retrieval by the
getCause()
method);
 may be null indicating the cause is non-existent or unknown.

Method Details
getIndex
public
int
getIndex
()
Retrieves the index of the column or parameter that was truncated.
This may be -1 if the column or parameter index is unknown, in
 which case the
parameter
and
read
fields should be ignored.
Returns:
the index of the truncated parameter or column value
getParameter
public
boolean
getParameter
()
Indicates whether the value truncated was a parameter value or
 a column value.
Returns:
true
if the value truncated was a parameter;
false
if it was a column value
getRead
public
boolean
getRead
()
Indicates whether or not the value was truncated on a read.
Returns:
true
if the value was truncated when read from
         the database;
false
if the data was truncated on a write
getDataSize
public
int
getDataSize
()
Gets the number of bytes of data that should have been transferred.
 This number may be approximate if data conversions were being
 performed.  The value may be
-1
if the size is unknown.
Returns:
the number of bytes of data that should have been transferred
getTransferSize
public
int
getTransferSize
()
Gets the number of bytes of data actually transferred.
 The value may be
-1
if the size is unknown.
Returns:
the number of bytes of data actually transferred
