Interface ConnectionBuilder

ConnectionBuilder
A builder created from a
DataSource
object,
 used to establish a connection to the database that the
data source
object represents.  The connection
 properties that were specified for the
data source
are used as the
 default values by the
ConnectionBuilder
.
The following example illustrates the use of
ConnectionBuilder
to create a
Connection
:
DataSource ds = new MyDataSource();
     ShardingKey superShardingKey = ds.createShardingKeyBuilder()
                           .subkey("EASTERN_REGION", JDBCType.VARCHAR)
                           .build();
     ShardingKey shardingKey = ds.createShardingKeyBuilder()
                           .subkey("PITTSBURGH_BRANCH", JDBCType.VARCHAR)
                           .build();
     Connection con = ds.createConnectionBuilder()
                       .user("rafa")
                       .password("tennis")
                       .shardingKey(shardingKey)
                       .superShardingKey(superShardingKey)
                       .build();
