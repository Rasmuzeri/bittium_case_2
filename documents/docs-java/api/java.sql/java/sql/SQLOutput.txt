Interface SQLOutput
All Known Implementing Classes:
SQLOutputImpl
public interface
SQLOutput
The output stream for writing the attributes of a user-defined
 type back to the database.  This interface, used
 only for custom mapping, is used by the driver, and its
 methods are never directly invoked by a programmer.
When an object of a class implementing the interface
SQLData
is passed as an argument to an SQL statement, the
 JDBC driver calls the method
SQLData.getSQLType
to
 determine the  kind of SQL
 datum being passed to the database.
 The driver then creates an instance of
SQLOutput
and
 passes it to the method
SQLData.writeSQL
.
 The method
writeSQL
in turn calls the
 appropriate
SQLOutput
writer
methods
writeBoolean
,
writeCharacterStream
, and so on)
 to write data from the
SQLData
object to
 the
SQLOutput
output stream as the
 representation of an SQL user-defined type.

x)
throws
SQLException
Writes to the stream the data contained in the given
SQLData
object.
 When the
SQLData
object is
null
, this
 method writes an SQL

SQLData.writeSQL
calls the appropriate
SQLOutput
writer method(s)
 for writing each of the object's attributes in order.
 The attributes must be read from an
SQLInput
input stream and written to an
SQLOutput
output stream in the same order in which they were
 listed in the SQL definition of the user-defined type.

 this method
Since:
1.6
writeObject
default
void
writeObject
(
Object
x,
SQLType
targetSqlType)
throws
SQLException
Writes to the stream the data contained in the given object. The
 object will be converted to the specified targetSqlType
 before being sent to the stream.
When the
object
is
null
, this
 method writes an SQL
NULL
to the stream.
If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing the
 interface
SQLData
),
 the JDBC driver should call the method
SQLData.writeSQL
to
 write it to the SQL data stream.
 If, on the other hand, the object is of a class implementing
Ref
,
Blob
,
Clob
,
NClob
,
Struct
,
java.net.URL
,
 or
Array
, the driver should pass it to the database as a
 value of the corresponding SQL type.
The default implementation will throw
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
Parameters:
x
- the object containing the input parameter value
targetSqlType
- the SQL type to be sent to the database.
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs  or
         if the Java Object specified by x is an InputStream
         or Reader object and the value of the scale parameter is less
         than zero
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
- if
 the JDBC driver does not support this data type
