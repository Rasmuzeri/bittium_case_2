Interface NClob
All Superinterfaces:
Clob
public interface
NClob
extends
Clob
The mapping in the Java programming language
 for the SQL
NCLOB
type.
 An SQL
NCLOB
is a built-in type
 that stores a Character Large Object using the National Character Set
  as a column value in a row of  a database table.
The
NClob
interface extends the
Clob
interface
 which provides methods for getting the
 length of an SQL
NCLOB
value,
 for materializing a
NCLOB
value on the client, and for
 searching for a substring or
NCLOB
object within a
NCLOB
value. A
NClob
object, just like a
Clob
object, is valid for the duration
 of the transaction in which it was created.
 Methods in the interfaces
ResultSet
,
CallableStatement
, and
PreparedStatement
, such as
getNClob
and
setNClob
allow a programmer to
 access an SQL
NCLOB
value.  In addition, this interface
 has methods for updating a
NCLOB
value.
All methods on the
NClob
interface must be fully implemented if the
 JDBC driver supports the data type.
