Interface XADataSource
All Superinterfaces:
CommonDataSource
public interface
XADataSource
extends
CommonDataSource
A factory for
XAConnection
objects that is used internally.
 An object that implements the
XADataSource
interface is
 typically registered with a naming service that uses the
 Java Naming and Directory Interface
 (JNDI).
An implementation of
XADataSource
must include a public no-arg
 constructor.
Since:
1.4

Method Details
getXAConnection
XAConnection
getXAConnection
()
                      throws
SQLException
Attempts to establish a physical database connection that can be
 used in a distributed transaction.
Returns:
an
XAConnection
object, which represents a
          physical connection to a data source, that can be used in
          a distributed transaction
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
- if the JDBC driver does not support
 this method
SQLTimeoutException
- when the driver has determined that the
 timeout value specified by the
setLoginTimeout
method
 has been exceeded and has at least tried to cancel the
 current database connection attempt

getXAConnection
XAConnection
getXAConnection
(
String
user,

password)
throws
SQLException
Attempts to establish a physical database connection, using the given
 user name and password. The connection that is returned is one that
 can be used in a distributed transaction.
Parameters:
user
- the database user on whose behalf the connection is being made
password
- the user's password

an
XAConnection
object, which represents a
          physical connection to a data source, that can be used in
          a distributed transaction
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
- if the JDBC driver does not support
 this method
SQLTimeoutException

getLogWriter
PrintWriter
getLogWriter
()
                  throws
SQLException
Retrieves the log writer for this
DataSource
object.
The log writer is a character output stream to which all logging
 and tracing messages for this data source will be
 printed.  This includes messages printed by the methods of this
 object, messages printed by methods of other objects manufactured
 by this object, and so on.  Messages printed to a data source
 specific log writer are not printed to the log writer associated
 with the
java.sql.DriverManager
class.  When a
DataSource
object is
 created, the log writer is initially null; in other words, the
 default is for logging to be disabled.
Specified by:
getLogWriter
in interface
CommonDataSource
Returns:
the log writer for this data source or null if
        logging is disabled
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs
Since:
1.4

void
setLogWriter
(
PrintWriter
out)
throws
SQLException
Sets the log writer for this
DataSource
object to the given
java.io.PrintWriter
object.
The log writer is a character output stream to which all logging
 and tracing messages for this data source will be
 printed.  This includes messages printed by the methods of this
 object, messages printed by methods of other objects manufactured
 by this object, and so on.  Messages printed to a data source-
 specific log writer are not printed to the log writer associated
 with the
java.sql.DriverManager
class. When a
DataSource
object is created the log writer is
 initially null; in other words, the default is for logging to be
 disabled.
Specified by:
setLogWriter
in interface
CommonDataSource
Parameters:
out
- the new log writer; to disable logging, set to null
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs
Since:
1.4

CommonDataSource.getLogWriter()
setLoginTimeout
void
setLoginTimeout
(int seconds)
throws
SQLException
Sets the maximum time in seconds that this data source will wait
 while attempting to connect to a database.  A value of zero
 specifies that the timeout is the default system timeout
 if there is one; otherwise, it specifies that there is no timeout.
 When a
DataSource
object is created, the login timeout is
 initially zero.
Specified by:
setLoginTimeout
in interface
CommonDataSource
Parameters:
seconds
- the data source login time limit
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs.
Since:
1.4

int
getLoginTimeout
()
             throws

 while attempting to connect to a database.  A value of zero
 means that the timeout is the default system timeout
 if there is one; otherwise, it means that there is no timeout.
 When a
DataSource
object is created, the login timeout is
 initially zero.
Specified by:
getLoginTimeout
in interface

The default implementation will throw a
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
.
Returns:
The XAConnectionBuilder instance that was created
Throws:
