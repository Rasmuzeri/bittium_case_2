Interface RowSetReader
All Known Subinterfaces:
XmlReader
public interface
RowSetReader
The facility that a disconnected
RowSet
object calls on
 to populate itself with rows of data. A reader (an object implementing the
RowSetReader
interface) may be registered with
 a
RowSet
object that supports the reader/writer paradigm.
 When the
RowSet
object's
execute
method is
 called, it in turn calls the reader's
readData
method.
Since:
1.4

Modifier and Type
Method
Description
void
readData
(
RowSetInternal
caller)
Reads the new contents of the calling
RowSet
object.
Method Details
readData
void
readData
(
RowSetInternal
caller)
throws
SQLException
Reads the new contents of the calling
RowSet
object.
 In order to call this method, a
RowSet
object must have implemented the
RowSetInternal
interface
 and registered this
RowSetReader
object as its reader.
 The
readData
method is invoked internally
 by the
RowSet.execute
method for rowsets that support the
 reader/writer paradigm.
The
readData
method adds rows to the caller.
 It can be implemented in a wide variety of ways and can even
 populate the caller with rows from a nonrelational data source.
 In general, a reader may invoke any of the rowset's methods,
 with one exception. Calling the method
execute
will
 cause an
SQLException
to be thrown
 because
execute
may not be called recursively.  Also,
 when a reader invokes
RowSet
methods, no listeners
 are notified; that is, no
RowSetEvent
objects are
 generated and no
RowSetListener
methods are invoked.
 This is true because listeners are already being notified by the method
execute
.
Parameters:
caller
- the
RowSet
object (1) that has implemented the
RowSetInternal
interface, (2) with which this reader is
        registered, and (3) whose
execute
method called this reader
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs or this method
         invokes the
RowSet.execute
method
