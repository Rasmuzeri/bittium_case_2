ShardingKeyBuilder
createShardingKeyBuilder
()
Creates a new
ShardingKeyBuilder
instance
int
getLoginTimeout
()
Gets the maximum time in seconds that this data source can wait
 while attempting to connect to a database.
PrintWriter
getLogWriter
()
Retrieves the log writer for this
DataSource
object.
Logger
getParentLogger
()
Return the parent Logger of all the Loggers used by this data source.
void
setLoginTimeout
(int seconds)
Sets the maximum time in seconds that this data source will wait
 while attempting to connect to a database.
void
setLogWriter
(
PrintWriter
out)
Sets the log writer for this
DataSource
object to the given
java.io.PrintWriter
object.
Method Details
getLogWriter
PrintWriter
getLogWriter
()
                  throws
SQLException
Retrieves the log writer for this
DataSource
object.
The log writer is a character output stream to which all logging
 and tracing messages for this data source will be
 printed.  This includes messages printed by the methods of this
 object, messages printed by methods of other objects manufactured
 by this object, and so on.  Messages printed to a data source
 specific log writer are not printed to the log writer associated
 with the
java.sql.DriverManager
class.  When a
DataSource
object is
 created, the log writer is initially null; in other words, the
 default is for logging to be disabled.
Returns:
the log writer for this data source or null if
        logging is disabled
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs

void
setLogWriter
(
PrintWriter

throws
SQLException
Sets the log writer for this
DataSource
object to the given
java.io.PrintWriter
object.
The log writer is a character output stream to which all logging
 and tracing messages for this data source will be
 printed.  This includes messages printed by the methods of this
 object, messages printed by methods of other objects manufactured
 by this object, and so on.  Messages printed to a data source-
 specific log writer are not printed to the log writer associated
 with the
java.sql.DriverManager
class. When a
DataSource
object is created the log writer is
 initially null; in other words, the default is for logging to be
 disabled.
Parameters:
out
- the new log writer; to disable logging, set to null
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs

getLogWriter()
setLoginTimeout
void
setLoginTimeout
(int seconds)
throws
SQLException
Sets the maximum time in seconds that this data source will wait
 while attempting to connect to a database.  A value of zero
 specifies that the timeout is the default system timeout
 if there is one; otherwise, it specifies that there is no timeout.
 When a
DataSource
object is created, the login timeout is
 initially zero.
Parameters:
seconds
- the data source login time limit
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs.

getLoginTimeout()
getLoginTimeout
int
getLoginTimeout
()
             throws
SQLException
Gets the maximum time in seconds that this data source can wait
 while attempting to connect to a database.  A value of zero
 means that the timeout is the default system timeout
 if there is one; otherwise, it means that there is no timeout.
 When a
DataSource
object is created, the login timeout is
 initially zero.
Returns:
the data source login time limit
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs.
See Also:
setLoginTimeout(int)
getParentLogger
Logger
getParentLogger
()
                throws
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
Return the parent Logger of all the Loggers used by this data source. This
 should be the Logger farthest from the root Logger that is
 still an ancestor of all of the Loggers used by this data source. Configuring
 this Logger will affect all of the log messages generated by the data source.
 In the worst case, this may be the root Logger.
Returns:
the parent Logger for this data source
Throws:
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
- if the data source does not use
java.util.logging

instance
Implementation Requirements:
The default implementation will throw a
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
.
Returns:
The ShardingKeyBuilder instance that was created
Throws:
