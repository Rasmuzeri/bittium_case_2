Interface ConnectionEventListener
All Superinterfaces:
EventListener
public interface
ConnectionEventListener
extends
EventListener
An object that registers to be notified of events generated by a
PooledConnection
object.
The
ConnectionEventListener
interface is implemented by a
 connection pooling component.  A connection pooling component will
 usually be provided by a JDBC driver vendor or another system software
 vendor.  A JDBC driver notifies a
ConnectionEventListener
object when an application is finished using a pooled connection with
 which the listener has registered.  The notification
 occurs after the application calls the method
close
on
 its representation of a
PooledConnection
object.  A
ConnectionEventListener
is also notified when a
 connection error occurs due to the fact that the
PooledConnection
is unfit for future use---the server has crashed, for example.
 The listener is notified by the JDBC driver just before the driver throws an
SQLException
to the application using the
PooledConnection
object.

close
on its
 representation of a pooled connection.

Method Details
connectionClosed
void
connectionClosed
(
ConnectionEvent
event)
Notifies this
ConnectionEventListener
that
 the application has called the method
close
on its
 representation of a pooled connection.
Parameters:
event
- an event object describing the source of
 the event
connectionErrorOccurred
void
connectionErrorOccurred
(
ConnectionEvent
event)
Notifies this
ConnectionEventListener
that
 a fatal error has occurred and the pooled connection can
 no longer be used.  The driver makes this notification just
 before it throws the application the
SQLException
contained in the given
ConnectionEvent
object.
Parameters:
event
- an event object describing the source of
 the event and containing the
SQLException
that the
 driver is about to throw
