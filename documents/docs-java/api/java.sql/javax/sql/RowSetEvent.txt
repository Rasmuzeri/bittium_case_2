Class RowSetEvent
java.lang.Object
java.util.EventObject
javax.sql.RowSetEvent
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
RowSetEvent
extends
EventObject
An
Event
object generated when an event occurs to a
RowSet
object.  A
RowSetEvent
object is
 generated when a single row in a rowset is changed, the whole rowset
 is changed, or the rowset cursor moves.
When an event occurs on a
RowSet
object, one of the
RowSetListener
methods will be sent to all registered
 listeners to notify them of the event.  An
Event
object
 is supplied to the
RowSetListener
method so that the
 listener can use it to find out which
RowSet
object is
 the source of the event.

1.4
