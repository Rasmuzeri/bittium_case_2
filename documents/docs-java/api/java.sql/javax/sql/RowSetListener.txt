Interface RowSetListener
All Superinterfaces:
EventListener
public interface
RowSetListener
extends
EventListener
An interface that must be implemented by a
 component that wants to be notified when a significant
 event happens in the life of a
RowSet
object.
 A component becomes a listener by being registered with a
RowSet
object via the method
RowSet.addRowSetListener
.
 How a registered component implements this interface determines what it does
 when it is notified of an event.
