Interface XAConnection
All Superinterfaces:
PooledConnection
public interface
XAConnection
extends
PooledConnection
An object that provides support for distributed transactions. An
XAConnection
object may be enlisted in a distributed transaction
 by means of an
XAResource
object. A transaction manager, usually
 part of a middle tier server, manages an
XAConnection
object
 through the
XAResource
object.
An application programmer does not use this interface directly; rather, it is
 used by a transaction manager working in the middle tier server.
Since:
1.4
