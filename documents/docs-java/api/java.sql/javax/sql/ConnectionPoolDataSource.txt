Interface ConnectionPoolDataSource
All Superinterfaces:
CommonDataSource
public interface
ConnectionPoolDataSource
extends
CommonDataSource
A factory for
PooledConnection
objects.  An object that implements this interface will typically be
 registered with a naming service that is based on the
 Java Naming and Directory Interface
 (JNDI).
Since:
1.4

Method Details
getPooledConnection
PooledConnection
getPooledConnection
()
                              throws
SQLException
Attempts to establish a physical database connection that can
 be used as a pooled connection.
Returns:
a
PooledConnection
object that is a physical
         connection to the database that this
ConnectionPoolDataSource
object represents
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
- if the JDBC driver does not support
 this method
Since:
1.4
getPooledConnection
PooledConnection
getPooledConnection
(
String
user,
String
password)
throws
SQLException
Attempts to establish a physical database connection that can
 be used as a pooled connection.
Parameters:
user
- the database user on whose behalf the connection is being made
password
- the user's password
Returns:
a
PooledConnection
object that is a physical
         connection to the database that this
ConnectionPoolDataSource
object represents
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException

getLogWriter
PrintWriter
getLogWriter
()
                  throws
SQLException
Retrieves the log writer for this
DataSource
object.
The log writer is a character output stream to which all logging
 and tracing messages for this data source will be
 printed.  This includes messages printed by the methods of this
 object, messages printed by methods of other objects manufactured
 by this object, and so on.  Messages printed to a data source
 specific log writer are not printed to the log writer associated
 with the
java.sql.DriverManager
class.  When a
DataSource
object is
 created, the log writer is initially null; in other words, the
 default is for logging to be disabled.
Specified by:
getLogWriter
in interface
CommonDataSource
Returns:
the log writer for this data source or null if
        logging is disabled
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs
Since:
1.4

out)
throws
SQLException
Sets the log writer for this
DataSource
object to the given
java.io.PrintWriter
object.
The log writer is a character output stream to which all logging
 and tracing messages for this data source will be
 printed.  This includes messages printed by the methods of this
 object, messages printed by methods of other objects manufactured
 by this object, and so on.  Messages printed to a data source-
 specific log writer are not printed to the log writer associated
 with the
java.sql.DriverManager
class. When a
DataSource
object is created the log writer is
 initially null; in other words, the default is for logging to be
 disabled.
Specified by:
setLogWriter
in interface
CommonDataSource
Parameters:
out
- the new log writer; to disable logging, set to null
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs

CommonDataSource.getLogWriter()
setLoginTimeout
void
setLoginTimeout
(int seconds)
throws
SQLException
Sets the maximum time in seconds that this data source will wait
 while attempting to connect to a database.  A value of zero
 specifies that the timeout is the default system timeout
 if there is one; otherwise, it specifies that there is no timeout.
 When a
DataSource
object is created, the login timeout is
 initially zero.
Specified by:
setLoginTimeout
in interface
CommonDataSource
Parameters:
seconds
- the data source login time limit
Throws:
SQLException
- if a database access error occurs.
Since:
1.4
