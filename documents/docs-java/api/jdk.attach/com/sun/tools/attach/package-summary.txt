Package com.sun.tools.attach
package
com.sun.tools.attach
Provides the API to attach to a Java virtual machine.
A tool, written in the Java Language, uses this API to attach to a target
 virtual machine (VM) and load its tool agent into the target VM. For
 example, a management console might have a management agent which it uses
 to  obtain management information from instrumented objects in a Java
 virtual machine. If the management console is required to manage
 an application that is running in a virtual machine that does not include
 the management agent, then this API can be used to attach to the target
 VM and load the agent.
