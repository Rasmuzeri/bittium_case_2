Class AttachPermission
java.lang.Object
java.security.Permission
java.security.BasicPermission
com.sun.tools.attach.AttachPermission
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
,

public final class
AttachPermission
extends
BasicPermission
When a
SecurityManager
set, this
 is the permission which will be checked when code invokes
VirtualMachine.attach
to attach to a target virtual
 machine.
 This permission is also checked when an
AttachProvider
is created.
An
AttachPermission
object contains a name (also referred
 to as a "target name") but no actions list; you either have the
 named permission or you don't.
 The following table provides a summary description of what the
 permission allows, and discusses the risks of granting code the
 permission.
Table shows permission
 target name, what the permission allows, and associated risks
Permission Target Name
What the Permission Allows
Risks of Allowing this Permission
attachVirtualMachine
Ability to attach to another Java virtual machine and load agents
       into that VM.
This allows an attacker to control the target VM which can potentially
       cause it to misbehave.
createAttachProvider
Ability to create an
AttachProvider
instance.
This allows an attacker to create an AttachProvider which can
       potentially be used to attach to other Java virtual machines.
Programmers do not normally create AttachPermission objects directly.
 Instead they are created by the security policy code based on reading
 the security policy file.
