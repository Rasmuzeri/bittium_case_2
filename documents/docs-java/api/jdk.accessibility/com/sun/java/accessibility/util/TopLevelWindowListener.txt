Interface TopLevelWindowListener
All Superinterfaces:

 or destroyed in the Java Virtual Machine.  Classes wishing to express
 an interest in top level window events should implement this interface
 and register themselves with the
EventQueueMonitor
by calling the
EventQueueMonitor.addTopLevelWindowListener
