Interface GUIInitializedListener
All Superinterfaces:
EventListener
public interface
GUIInitializedListener
extends
EventListener
The
GUIInitializedListener
interface is used by the
EventQueueMonitor
class to notify an interested party when the GUI subsystem has been
 initialized.  This is necessary because assistive technologies can
 be loaded before the GUI subsystem is initialized.  As a result,
 assistive technologies should check the
isGUIInitialized
method
 of
EventQueueMonitor
before creating any GUI components.  If the
 return value is true, assistive technologies can create GUI components
 following the same thread restrictions as any other application.  If
 the return value is false, the assistive technology should register
 a
GUIInitializedListener
with the
EventQueueMonitor
to be notified
 when the GUI subsystem is initialized.
