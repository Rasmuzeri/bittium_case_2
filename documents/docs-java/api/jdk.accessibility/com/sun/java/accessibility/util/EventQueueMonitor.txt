Class EventQueueMonitor
java.lang.Object
com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor
All Implemented Interfaces:
AWTEventListener
,
EventListener
public class
EventQueueMonitor
extends
Object
implements
AWTEventListener
The
EventQueueMonitor
class provides key core functionality for Assistive
 Technologies (and other system-level technologies that need some of the same
 things that Assistive Technology needs).

Constructor Details
EventQueueMonitor
public
EventQueueMonitor
()
Create a new
EventQueueMonitor
instance.  Normally, this will
 be called only by the AWT Toolkit during initialization time.
 Assistive technologies should not create instances of
 EventQueueMonitor by themselves.  Instead, they should either
 refer to it directly via the static methods in this class, e.g.,
getCurrentMousePosition()
or obtain the instance by asking the
 Toolkit, e.g.,
Toolkit.getSystemEventQueue()
.
Method Details
maybeInitialize
public static
void
maybeInitialize
()
Tell the
EventQueueMonitor
to start listening for events.
eventDispatched
public
void
eventDispatched
(
AWTEvent
theEvent)
Handle events as a result of registering a listener
 on the
EventQueue
in
maybeInitialize()
.
Specified by:
eventDispatched
in interface
AWTEventListener
Parameters:
theEvent
- the event to be processed
getAccessibleAt
public static
Accessible
getAccessibleAt
(
Point
p)
Obtain the
Accessible
object at the given point on the Screen.
 The return value may be null if an
Accessible
object cannot be
 found at the particular point.
Parameters:
p
- the point to be accessed
Returns:
the
Accessible
at the specified point
isGUIInitialized
public static
boolean
isGUIInitialized
()
Says whether the GUI subsystem has been initialized or not.
 If this returns true, the assistive technology can freely
 create GUI component instances.  If the return value is false,
 the assistive technology should register a
GUIInitializedListener
and wait to create GUI component instances until the listener is
 called.
Returns:
true if the GUI subsystem has been initialized

addGUIInitializedListener(com.sun.java.accessibility.util.GUIInitializedListener)
addGUIInitializedListener
public static
void
addGUIInitializedListener
(
GUIInitializedListener
l)
Adds the specified listener to be notified when the GUI subsystem
 is initialized.  Assistive technologies should get the results of
isGUIInitialized()
before calling this method.
Parameters:
l
- the listener to add
