Class AccessibilityEventMonitor
java.lang.Object
com.sun.java.accessibility.util.AccessibilityEventMonitor
public class
AccessibilityEventMonitor
extends
Object
AccessibilityEventMonitor
implements a PropertyChange listener
 on every UI object that implements interface
Accessible
in the Java
 Virtual Machine.  The events captured by these listeners are made available
 through listeners supported by
AccessibilityEventMonitor
.
 With this, all the individual events on each of the UI object
 instances are funneled into one set of PropertyChange listeners.
This class depends upon
EventQueueMonitor
, which provides the base
 level support for capturing the top-level containers as they are created.
