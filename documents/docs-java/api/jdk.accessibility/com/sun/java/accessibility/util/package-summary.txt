Package com.sun.java.accessibility.util
package
com.sun.java.accessibility.util
Provides a collection of interfaces and classes that compose the Java Accessibility
 Utilities.  The classes are used by Assistive Technologies, such as the screen
 readers which are used by those who are blind, and help provide access to GUI
 toolkits that implement the Java Accessibility API.  An overview of the important
 classes follows.
The class
AccessibilityEventMonitor
implements a PropertyChange
 listener on every UI object that implements interface
Accessible
in the Java
 Virtual Machine.
The class
AWTEventMonitor
implements a suite of listeners that are
 conditionally installed on every AWT component instance in the Java Virtual Machine.
The class
EventQueueMonitor
provides key core functionality for
 Assistive Technologies (and other system-level technologies that need some of
 the same things that Assistive Technology needs).
The class
GUIInitializedMulticaster
is used to maintain a list of
GUIInitializedListener
classes which are used by the
EventQueueMonitor
class to notify an interested party when the GUI subsystem has been initialized.
 Note that this class is intended to be used primarily for internal support in
 the
EventQueueMonitor
class, and is not intended to be used by classes
 outside the Java Accessibility Utility package.
The class
SwingEventMonitor
extends
AWTEventMonitor
by adding
 a suite of listeners conditionally installed on every Swing component instance
 in the Java Virtual Machine.
The class
TopLevelWindowMulticaster
is used to maintain a list of
TopLevelWindowListener
classes which are used by the
EventQueueMonitor
class to notify an interested party when a top level window is created or destroyed
 in the Java Virtual Machine  Note that this class is intended to be used primarily
 for internal support in the
EventQueueMonitor
class, and is not intended
 to be used by classes outside the Java Accessibility Utility package.
The class
Translator
provides a translation to interface
Accessible
for objects that do not implement interface
Accessible
.

AccessibilityEventMonitor
AccessibilityEventMonitor
implements a PropertyChange listener
 on every UI object that implements interface
Accessible
in the Java
 Virtual Machine.
AccessibilityListenerList
The
AccessibilityListenerList
is a copy of the Swing
EventListerList
class.
AWTEventMonitor
The
AWTEventMonitor
implements a suite of listeners that are
 conditionally installed on every AWT component instance in the Java
 Virtual Machine.
EventID
EventID contains integer constants that map to event support in
 AWT and Swing.
EventQueueMonitor
The
EventQueueMonitor
class provides key core functionality for Assistive
 Technologies (and other system-level technologies that need some of the same
 things that Assistive Technology needs).
GUIInitializedListener
The
GUIInitializedListener
interface is used by the
EventQueueMonitor
class to notify an interested party when the GUI subsystem has been
 initialized.
SwingEventMonitor
SwingEventMonitor
extends
AWTEventMonitor
by adding a suite of
 listeners conditionally installed on every Swing component instance
 in the Java Virtual Machine.
TopLevelWindowListener
The
TopLevelWindowListener
interface is used by the
EventQueueMonitor
class to notify an interested party when a top level window is created
 or destroyed in the Java Virtual Machine.
Translator
The
Translator
class provides a translation to interface
Accessible
for objects that do not implement interface
Accessible
