Package jdk.incubator.vector

Incubating Feature.
Will be removed in a future release.
This package provides
 classes to express vector computations that, given suitable hardware
 and runtime ability, are accelerated using vector hardware instructions.
A
vector
is a
sequence of a fixed number of
lanes
,
 all of some fixed
element type
such as
byte
,
long
, or
float
.
 Each lane contains an independent value of the element type.
 Operations on vectors are typically
lane-wise
,
 distributing some scalar operator (such as
addition
)
 across the lanes of the participating vectors,
 usually generating a vector result whose lanes contain the various
 scalar results.  When run on a supporting platform, lane-wise
 operations can be executed in parallel by the hardware.  This style
 of parallelism is called
Single Instruction Multiple Data
(SIMD) parallelism.
In the SIMD style of programming, most of the operations within
 a vector lane are unconditional, but the effect of conditional
 execution may be achieved using
masked operations
such as
blend()
,
 under the control of an associated
VectorMask
.
 Data motion other than strictly lane-wise flow is achieved using
cross-lane
operations, often under the control of an associated
VectorShuffle
.
 Lane data and/or whole vectors can be reformatted using various
 kinds of lane-wise
conversions
,
 and byte-wise reformatting
reinterpretations
,
 often under the control of a reflective
VectorSpecies
object which selects an alternative vector format different
 from that of the input vector.
Vector<E>
declares a set of vector operations (methods)
 that are common to all element types.  These common operations
 include generic access to lane values, data selection and movement,
 reformatting, and certain arithmetic and logical operations (such as addition
 or comparison) that are common to all primitive types.
Public subtypes of
Vector
correspond to specific
 element types.  These declare further operations that are specific
 to that element type, including unboxed access to lane values,
 bitwise operations on values of integral element types, or
 transcendental operations on values of floating point element
 types.
Some lane-wise operations, such as the
add
operator, are defined as
 a full-service named operation, where a corresponding method on
Vector
comes in masked and unmasked overloadings, and (in subclasses) also comes in
 covariant overrides (returning the subclass) and additional scalar-broadcast
 overloadings (both masked and unmasked).

 Other lane-wise operations, such as the
min
operator, are defined as a
 partially serviced (not a full-service) named operation, where a corresponding
 method on
Vector
and/or a subclass provide some but all possible
 overloadings and overrides (commonly the unmasked variant with scalar-broadcast
 overloadings).

 Finally, all lane-wise operations (those named as previously described,
 or otherwise unnamed method-wise) have a corresponding
operator token
declared as a static constant on
VectorOperators
.
 Each operator token defines a symbolic Java expression for the operation,
 such as
a + b
for the
ADD
operator token.
 General lane-wise operation-token accepting methods, such as for a
unary lane-wise
operation, are provided on
Vector
and come in the same variants as
 a full-service named operation.
This package contains a public subtype of
Vector
corresponding to each supported element type:
ByteVector
,
ShortVector
,
IntVector
,
LongVector
,
FloatVector
, and
DoubleVector
.
Here is an example of multiplying elements of two float arrays
a
and
b
using vector computation
 and storing result in array
c
.
static final VectorSpecies<Float> SPECIES = FloatVector.SPECIES_PREFERRED;

 void vectorMultiply(float[] a, float[] b, float[] c) {
   // It is assumed array arguments are of the same size
   for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i += SPECIES.length()) {
         VectorMask<Float> m = SPECIES.indexInRange(i, a.length);
         FloatVector va = FloatVector.fromArray(SPECIES, a, i, m);
         FloatVector vb = FloatVector.fromArray(SPECIES, b, i, m);
         FloatVector vc = va.mul(vb)
         vc.intoArray(c, i, m);
   }
 }
In the above example, we use masks, generated by
indexInRange()
,
 to prevent reading/writing past the array length.
 The first
a.length / SPECIES.length()
iterations will have a mask
 with all lanes set. Only the final iteration (if
a.length
is not a multiple of
SPECIES.length()
will have a mask with
 the first
a.length % SPECIES.length()
lanes set.

 Since a mask is used in all iterations, the above implementation
 may not achieve optimal performance (for large array lengths). The
 same computation can be implemented without masks as follows:
static final VectorSpecies<Float> SPECIES = FloatVector.SPECIES_PREFERRED;

 void vectorMultiply(float[] a, float[] b, float[] c) {
   int i = 0;
   // It is assumed array arguments are of the same size
   for (; i < SPECIES.loopBound(a.length); i += SPECIES.length()) {
         FloatVector va = FloatVector.fromArray(SPECIES, a, i);
         FloatVector vb = FloatVector.fromArray(SPECIES, b, i);
         FloatVector vc = va.mul(vb)
         vc.intoArray(c, i);
   }

   for (; i < a.length; i++) {
     c[i] = a[i] * b[i];
   }
 }
The scalar computation after the vector computation is required to
 process a
tail
of
TLENGTH
array elements, where
TLENGTH < SPECIES.length()
for the vector species.

 The examples above use the preferred species (
FloatVector.SPECIES_PREFERRED
),
 ensuring code dynamically adapts to optimal shape for the platform
 on which it runs.
The helper method
loopBound()
is used in the above code to find the end of the vector loop.
 A primitive masking expression such as
(a.length & ~(SPECIES.length() - 1))
might also be used
 here, since
SPECIES.length()
is known to be 8, which
 is a power of two.  But this is not always a correct assumption.
 For example, if the
FloatVector.SPECIES_PREFERRED
turns
 out to have the platform-dependent shape
S_Max_BIT
,
 and that shape has some odd hypothetical size such as 384 (which is
 a valid vector size according to some architectures), then the
 hand-tweaked primitive masking expression may produce surprising
 results.
Performance notes
This package depends on the runtime's ability to dynamically
 compile vector operations into optimal vector hardware
 instructions. There is a default scalar implementation for each
 operation which is used if the operation cannot be compiled to
 vector instructions.
There are certain things users need to pay attention to for
 generating optimal vector machine code:
The shape of vectors used should be supported by the underlying
 platform. For example, code written using
IntVector
of
VectorShape
S_512_BIT
will not be
 compiled to vector instructions on a platform which supports only
 256 bit vectors. Instead, the default scalar implementation will be
 used.  For this reason, it is recommended to use the preferred
 species as shown above to write generically sized vector
 computations.
Most classes defined in this package should be treated as
value-based
classes.
 This classification applies to
Vector
and its subtypes,
VectorMask
,
VectorShuffle
, and
VectorSpecies
.

 With these types,
identity-sensitive operations such as
==
may yield
 unpredictable results, or reduced performance.  Oddly enough,
v.equals(w)
is likely to be faster
 than
v==w
, since
equals
is
not
an identity
 sensitive method.

 Also, these objects can be stored in locals and parameters and as
static final
constants, but storing them in other Java
 fields or in array elements, while semantically valid, will may
 incur performance risks.
For every class in this package,
 unless specified otherwise, any method arguments of reference
 type must not be null, and any null argument will elicit a
NullPointerException
.  This fact is not individually
 documented for methods of this API.
