A
VectorShape
selects a particular implementation of
Vector
s.

 A shape in combination with the element type determines
 a particular
vector species
object.
API Note:
Because not all shapes are supported by all platforms,
 shape-agnostic code is more portable.
 User code that selects particular shapes may
 fail to run, or run slowly, on some platforms.
 Use
VectorShape.preferredShape()
and
VectorSpecies.ofPreferred()
to select the shape that is usually preferable for
 most uses.

()
Returns an array containing the constants of this enum class, in
the order they are declared.
Returns:
an array containing the constants of this enum class, in the order they are declared
valueOf
public static
VectorShape
valueOf
(
String
name)
Returns the enum constant of this class with the specified name.
The string must match
exactly
an identifier used to declare an
enum constant in this class.  (Extraneous whitespace characters are 
not permitted.)
Parameters:
name
- the name of the enum constant to be returned.
Returns:
the enum constant with the specified name
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if this enum class has no constant with the specified name
NullPointerException
- if the argument is null
vectorBitSize
public
int
vectorBitSize
()
Returns the size, in bits, of vectors of this shape.
Returns:
the size, in bits, of vectors of this shape.
withLanes
public
<E>
VectorSpecies
<E>
withLanes
(
Class
<E> elementType)
Finds a vector species with the given element type
 and the current shape.
 Returns the same value as
VectorSpecies.of(elementType, this)
.
Type Parameters:
E
- the boxed element type
Parameters:
elementType
- the required element type
Returns:
a species for the given element type and this shape
See Also:
VectorSpecies.of(Class, VectorShape)
forBitSize
public static
VectorShape
forBitSize
(int bitSize)
Finds an appropriate shape depending on the
 proposed bit-size of a vector.
Parameters:
bitSize
- the proposed vector size in bits
Returns:
a shape corresponding to the vector bit-size
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if no such vector shape exists
See Also:
vectorBitSize()
forIndexBitSize
public static
VectorShape
forIndexBitSize
(int indexBitSize,
 int elementSize)
Finds an appropriate index shape depending on the
 proposed index-bit-size and element-size of a vector.
Parameters:
indexBitSize
- the proposed index vector size in bits
elementSize
- the proposed element size in bits
Returns:
a shape corresponding to the index vector bit-size
 and element size.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if no such vector shape exists
See Also:
vectorBitSize()
preferredShape
public static
VectorShape
preferredShape
()
Finds the vector shape preferred by the current platform
 for all vector element types.
The preferred shape by the platform has the largest possible
 bit-size, under the constraint that all lane sizes are
 supported, from
byte
to
double
.  Thus, all the
preferred vector species
for various lane types will have a common underlying shape.
Returns:
a preferred shape for all element types
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException
- if no such shape exists
See Also:
VectorSpecies.ofPreferred(Class)
