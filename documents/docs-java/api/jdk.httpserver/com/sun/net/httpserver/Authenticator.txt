Class Authenticator
java.lang.Object
com.sun.net.httpserver.Authenticator
Direct Known Subclasses:
BasicAuthenticator
public abstract class
Authenticator
extends
Object
Authenticator represents an implementation of an HTTP authentication
 mechanism. Sub-classes provide implementations of specific mechanisms
 such as Digest or Basic auth. Instances are invoked to provide verification
 of the authentication information provided in all incoming requests.
 Note. This implies that any caching of credentials or other authentication
 information must be done outside of this class.

public abstract
Authenticator.Result
authenticate
(
HttpExchange
exch)
Called to authenticate each incoming request. The implementation
 must return a
Authenticator.Failure
,
Authenticator.Success
or
Authenticator.Retry
object as appropriate:
Failure
means the authentication has completed, but has
     failed due to invalid credentials.
Success
means that the authentication has succeeded,
     and a
Principal
object representing the user can be retrieved
     by calling
Authenticator.Success.getPrincipal()
.
Retry
means that another HTTP
exchange
is required. Any response headers needing to be sent back to the client are set
     in the given
HttpExchange
. The response code to be returned must be
     provided in the
Retry
object.
Retry
may occur multiple times.
Parameters:
exch
- the
HttpExchange
upon which authenticate is called
Returns:
