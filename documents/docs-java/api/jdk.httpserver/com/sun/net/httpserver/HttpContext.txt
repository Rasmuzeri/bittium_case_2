Class HttpContext
java.lang.Object
com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpContext
public abstract class
HttpContext
extends
Object
HttpContext
represents a mapping between the root
URI
path of an application to a
HttpHandler
which is invoked to handle
 requests destined for that path on the associated
HttpServer
or
HttpsServer
.
HttpContext
instances are created by the create methods in
HttpServer
and
HttpsServer
.
A chain of
Filter
objects can be added to a
HttpContext
.
 All exchanges processed by the context can be pre- and post-processed by each
Filter
in the chain.
Since:

HttpExchange
processed by this context.
Returns:

containing the attributes of this context
getFilters
public abstract
List
<

>
getFilters
()
Returns this context's

Authenticator
to set. If
null
then any previously
             set
