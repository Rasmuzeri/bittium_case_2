getRequestHeaders
Headers
getRequestHeaders
()
Returns an immutable
Headers
containing the HTTP headers that
 were included with this request.
The keys in this
Headers
are the header names, while the
 values are a
List
of
Strings
containing each value that was
 included in the request, in the order they were included. Header fields
 appearing multiple times are represented as multiple string values.
The keys in
Headers
are case-insensitive.
Returns:
a read-only
Headers
which can be used to access request
         headers.
with
default
Request
with
(
String
headerName,
List
<
String
> headerValues)
Returns an identical
Request
with an additional header.
The returned
Request
has the same set of
headers
as
this
request, but with
 the addition of the given header. All other request state remains
 unchanged.
If
this
request already contains a header with the same name
 as the given
headerName
, then its value is not replaced.
Implementation Requirements:
The default implementation first creates a new
Headers
,
h
,
 then adds all the request headers from
this
request to
h
,
 then adds the given name-values mapping if
headerName
is
 not present in
h
. Then an unmodifiable view,
h'
, of
h
and a new
Request
,
r
, are created.
 The
getRequestMethod
and
getRequestURI
methods of
r
simply invoke the equivalently named method of
this
request. The
getRequestHeaders
method returns
h'
. Lastly,
r
is returned.
Parameters:
headerName
- the header name
headerValues
- the list of header values
Returns:
a request
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if any argument is null, or if any element
                              of headerValues is null.
