com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpsServer
public abstract class
HttpsServer
extends
HttpServer
This class is an extension of
HttpServer
which provides support for
 HTTPS.
A
HttpsServer
must have an associated

Method Details
create
public static
HttpsServer
create
()
                          throws
IOException
Creates a
HttpsServer
instance which is initially not bound to any
 local address/port. The
HttpsServer
is acquired from the currently
 installed
HttpServerProvider
. The server must be bound using
HttpServer.bind(InetSocketAddress,int)
before it can be used. The server
 must also have a
HttpsConfigurator
established with
setHttpsConfigurator(HttpsConfigurator)
.
Returns:
an instance of
HttpsServer
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs
create
public static
HttpsServer
create
(
InetSocketAddress
addr,
 int backlog)
throws
IOException
Create a
HttpsServer
instance which will bind to the specified
InetSocketAddress
(IP address and port number).

 A maximum backlog can also be specified. This is the maximum number of
 queued incoming connections to allow on the listening socket. Queued TCP
 connections exceeding this limit may be rejected by the TCP implementation.
 The
HttpsServer
is acquired from the currently installed
HttpServerProvider
. The server must have a
HttpsConfigurator
established with
setHttpsConfigurator(HttpsConfigurator)
.
Parameters:
addr
- the address to listen on, if
null
then
HttpServer.bind(InetSocketAddress,int)
must be called to set
             the address
backlog
- the socket backlog. If this value is less than or equal to
               zero, then a system default value is used.
Returns:
an instance of
HttpsServer
Throws:
BindException
- if the server cannot bind to the requested address,
          or if the server is already bound
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs

public static
HttpsServer
create
(
InetSocketAddress
addr,
 int backlog,
String
path,
HttpHandler
handler,
Filter
... filters)
throws
IOException
Creates an
HttpsServer
instance with an initial context.
The server is created with an
initial context
that maps the
 URI
path
to the exchange
handler
. The initial context is
 created as if by an invocation of
createContext(path)
. The
filters
, if any, are added to the initial context, in the order
 they are given. The returned server is not started so can be configured
 further if required.
The server instance will bind to the given
InetSocketAddress
.
A maximum backlog can also be specified. This is the maximum number
 of queued incoming connections to allow on the listening socket.
 Queued TCP connections exceeding this limit may be rejected by
 the TCP implementation. The HttpsServer is acquired from the currently
 installed
HttpServerProvider
.
The server must have an HttpsConfigurator established with
setHttpsConfigurator(HttpsConfigurator)
.
Parameters:
addr
- the address to listen on, if
null
then
bind
must be called to set the address
backlog
- the socket backlog. If this value is less than or
                equal to zero, then a system default value is used
path
- the root URI path of the context, must be absolute
handler
- the HttpHandler for the context
filters
- the Filters for the context, optional
Returns:
the HttpsServer
Throws:
BindException
- if the server cannot bind to the address
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs
IllegalArgumentException
- if path is invalid
NullPointerException
- if any of:
path
,
handler
,
filters
, or any element of
filters
, are
null
