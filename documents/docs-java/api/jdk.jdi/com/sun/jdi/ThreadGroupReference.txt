 A ThreadGroupReference is an
ObjectReference
with additional
 access to threadgroup-specific information from the target VM.

Method Details
name
String
name
()
Returns the name of this thread group.
Returns:
the string containing the thread group name.
parent
ThreadGroupReference
parent
()
Returns the parent of this thread group.
Returns:
a
ThreadGroupReference
mirroring the parent of this
 thread group in the target VM, or null if this is a top-level
 thread group.
suspend
void
suspend
()
Suspends all threads in this thread group. Each thread
 in this group and in all of its subgroups will be
 suspended as described in
ThreadReference.suspend()
.
 This is not guaranteed to be an atomic
 operation; if the target VM is not interrupted at the time
 this method is
 called, it is possible that new threads will be created
 between the time that threads are enumerated and all of them
 have been suspended.
Throws:
VMCannotBeModifiedException
- if the VirtualMachine is read-only - see
VirtualMachine.canBeModified()
.
resume
void
resume
()
Resumes all threads in this thread group. Each thread
 in this group and in all of its subgroups will be
 resumed as described in
ThreadReference.resume()
.
Throws:
VMCannotBeModifiedException
- if the VirtualMachine is read-only - see
VirtualMachine.canBeModified()
.
threads
List
<
ThreadReference
>
threads
()
Returns a List containing a
ThreadReference
for each live platform
 thread in this thread group. Virtual threads are not included. Only the live
 platform threads in this immediate thread group (and not its subgroups) are
 returned. A thread is alive if it has been started and has not terminated.
Returns:
a List of
ThreadReference
objects mirroring the
 live platform threads from this thread group in the target VM.
threadGroups
List
<
ThreadGroupReference
>
threadGroups
()
Returns a List containing a
ThreadGroupReference
for each
 subgroup. Only the thread groups in this immediate thread group (and
 not its subgroups) are returned.
Returns:
a List of
ThreadGroupReference
objects mirroring the
 thread groups from this thread group in the target VM.
