TypeComponent
extends
Mirror
,
Accessible
An entity declared within a user defined
 type (class or interface).
 This interface is the root of the type
 component hierarchy which
 includes
Field
and
Method
.
 Type components of the same name declared in different classes
 (including those related by inheritance) have different
 TypeComponent objects.
 TypeComponents can be used alone to retrieve static information
 about their declaration, or can be used in conjunction with a
ReferenceType
or
ObjectReference
to access values
 or invoke, as applicable.

Method Details
name
String
name
()
Gets the name of this type component.
Note: for fields, this is the field name; for methods,
 this is the method name; for constructors, this is <init>;
 for static initializers, this is <clinit>.
Returns:
a string containing the name.
signature
String
signature
()
Gets the
type signature
for this type component. The
 signature is encoded type information as defined
 in the JNI documentation. It is a convenient, compact format for
 for manipulating type information internally, not necessarily
 for display to an end user. See
Field.typeName()
and
Method.returnTypeName()
for ways to help get a more readable
 representation of the type.
Returns:
a string containing the signature
genericSignature
String
genericSignature
()
Gets the generic signature for this TypeComponent if there is one.
 Generic signatures are described in the
The Java Virtual Machine Specification
.
Returns:
a string containing the generic signature, or
null
if there is no generic signature.
Since:
1.5
declaringType
ReferenceType
declaringType
()
Returns the type in which this component was declared. The
 returned
ReferenceType
mirrors either a class or an
 interface in the target VM.
Returns:
a
ReferenceType
for the type that declared
 this type component.
isStatic
boolean
isStatic
()
Determines if this TypeComponent is static.
 Return value is undefined for constructors and static initializers.
Returns:
true
if this type component was declared
 static; false otherwise.
isFinal
boolean
isFinal
()
Determines if this TypeComponent is final.
 Return value is undefined for constructors and static initializers.
Returns:
true
if this type component was declared
 final; false otherwise.
isSynthetic
boolean
isSynthetic
()
Determines if this TypeComponent is synthetic. Synthetic members
 are generated by the compiler and are not present in the source
 code for the containing class.
Not all target VMs support this query. See
VirtualMachine.canGetSyntheticAttribute()
to determine if the
 operation is supported.
Returns:
true
if this type component is synthetic;
false
otherwise.
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException
- if the target
 VM cannot provide information on synthetic attributes.
