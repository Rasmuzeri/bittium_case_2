Class JDIPermission

java.security.BasicPermission

All Implemented Interfaces:

,

public final class
JDIPermission
extends
BasicPermission
The
JDIPermission
class represents access rights to
 the
VirtualMachineManager
.  This is the permission
 which the SecurityManager will check when code that is running with
 a SecurityManager requests access to the VirtualMachineManager, as
 defined in the Java Debug Interface (JDI) for the Java platform.
A
JDIPermission
object contains a name (also referred
 to as a "target name") but no actions list; you either have the
 named permission or you don't.
The following table provides a summary description of what the
 permission allows, and discusses the risks of granting code the
 permission.
Table shows permission target name, what the
 permission allows, and associated risks

What the Permission Allows
Risks of Allowing this Permission
virtualMachineManager
Ability to inspect and modify the JDI objects in the
VirtualMachineManager
This allows an attacker to control the
VirtualMachineManager
and cause the system to
   misbehave.
Programmers do not normally create JDIPermission objects directly.
 Instead they are created by the security policy code based on reading
 the security policy file.
