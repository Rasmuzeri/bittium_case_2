Class TransportService.ListenKey
java.lang.Object
com.sun.jdi.connect.spi.TransportService.ListenKey
Enclosing class:
TransportService
public abstract static class
TransportService.ListenKey
extends
Object
A
listen key
.
A
TransportService
may listen on multiple, yet
 different, addresses at the same time. To uniquely identify
 each
listener
a listen key is created each time that
startListening
is called. The listen
 key is used in calls to the
accept
method
 to accept inbound connections to that listener. A listen
 key is valid until it is used as an argument to
stopListening
to stop the transport
 service from listening on an address.
