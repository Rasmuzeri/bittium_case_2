Connector
A method of connection between a debugger and a target VM.
 A connector encapsulates exactly one
Transport
. used
 to establish the connection. Each connector has a set of arguments
 which controls its operation. The arguments are stored as a
 map, keyed by a string. Each implementation defines the string
 argument keys it accepts.
Since:
