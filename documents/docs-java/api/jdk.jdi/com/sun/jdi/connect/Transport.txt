Transport
A method of communication between a debugger and a target VM.
A Transport represents the transport mechanism used by a
Connector

 target VM. It consists of a name which is obtained by invoking
 the
name()
method. Furthermore, a Transport encapsulates a
TransportService
which is the underlying
 service used to establish connections and exchange
 Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) packets with a target VM.
