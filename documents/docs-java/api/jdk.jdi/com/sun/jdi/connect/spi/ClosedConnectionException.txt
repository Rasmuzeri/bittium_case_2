Class ClosedConnectionException
java.lang.Object
java.lang.Throwable
java.lang.Exception
java.io.IOException
com.sun.jdi.connect.spi.ClosedConnectionException
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
ClosedConnectionException
extends
IOException
This exception may be thrown as a result of an asynchronous
 close of a
Connection
while an I/O operation is
 in progress.
When a thread is blocked in
readPacket
waiting for packet from a target VM the
Connection
may be closed asynchronous by another
 thread invoking the
close
method.
 When this arises the thread in readPacket will throw this
 exception. Similarly when a thread is blocked in
Connection.writePacket(byte[])
the Connection may be closed.
 When this occurs the thread in writePacket will throw
 this exception.
Since:
1.5
