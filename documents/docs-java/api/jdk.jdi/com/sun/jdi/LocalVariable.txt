A local variable in the target VM. Each variable declared within a
Method
has its own LocalVariable object. Variables of the same
 name declared in different scopes have different LocalVariable objects.
 LocalVariables can be used alone to retrieve static information
 about their declaration, or can be used in conjunction with a
StackFrame
to set and get values.

1.3

Description
boolean
equals

Compares the specified Object with this LocalVariable for equality.
String
genericSignature
()
Gets the generic signature for this variable if there is one.
int
hashCode
()
Returns the hash code value for this LocalVariable.
boolean
isArgument
()
Determines if this variable is an argument to its method.
boolean
isVisible

frame)
Determines whether this variable can be accessed from the given
StackFrame
.
String
name

()
Gets the
type signature
of the local variable.

Method Details
name
String
name
()
Gets the name of the local variable.
Returns:
a string containing the name.
typeName
String
typeName
()
Returns a text representation of the type
 of this variable.
 Where the type is the type specified in the declaration
 of this local variable.
This type name is always available even if
 the type has not yet been created or loaded.
Returns:
a String representing the
 type of this local variable.
type
Type
type
()
   throws
ClassNotLoadedException
Returns the type of this variable.
 Where the type is the type specified in the declaration
 of this local variable.
Note: if the type of this variable is a reference type (class,
 interface, or array) and it has not been created or loaded
 by the class loader of the enclosing class,
 then ClassNotLoadedException will be thrown.
 Also, a reference type may have been loaded but not yet prepared,
 in which case the type will be returned
 but attempts to perform some operations on the returned type
 (e.g.
fields()
) will throw
 a
ClassNotPreparedException
.
 Use
ReferenceType.isPrepared()
to determine if
 a reference type is prepared.
Returns:
the
Type
of this local variable.
Throws:
ClassNotLoadedException
- if the type has not yet been loaded
 through the appropriate class loader.

Type
Field.type() - for usage examples
signature
String
signature
()
Gets the
type signature
of the local variable.
Returns:
a string containing the signature.
genericSignature
String
genericSignature
()
Gets the generic signature for this variable if there is one.
 Generic signatures are described in the
The Java Virtual Machine Specification
.
Returns:
a string containing the generic signature, or
null
if there is no generic signature.
Since:
1.5
isVisible
boolean
isVisible
(
StackFrame
frame)
Determines whether this variable can be accessed from the given
StackFrame
.

 See
StackFrame.visibleVariables()
for a complete description
 variable visibility in this interface.
Parameters:
frame
- the StackFrame querying visibility
Returns:
true
if this variable is visible;
false
otherwise.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the stack frame's method
 does not match this variable's method.
isArgument
boolean
isArgument
()
Determines if this variable is an argument to its method.
Returns:
true
if this variable is an argument;
false
otherwise.
equals
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Compares the specified Object with this LocalVariable for equality.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- the reference object with which to compare.
Returns:
true if the Object is a LocalVariable, if both LocalVariables
 are contained in the same method (as determined by
Method.equals(java.lang.Object)
), and if both LocalVariables mirror
 the same declaration within that method

Object.hashCode()
HashMap
hashCode
int
hashCode
()
Returns the hash code value for this LocalVariable.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
the integer hash code
