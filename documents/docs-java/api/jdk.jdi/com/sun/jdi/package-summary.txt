Package com.sun.jdi
package
com.sun.jdi
This is the core package of the Java Debug
 Interface (JDI), it defines mirrors for values, types, and the target
 VirtualMachine itself - as well bootstrapping facilities.
VirtualMachine
mirrors the target virtual machine and
 is the origin of all information provided by the JDI.  A VirtualMachine
 is typically created by using the
VirtualMachineManager
to create
 a connection to the target virtual machine (see the
com.sun.jdi.connect
package).  In turn the
VirtualMachineManager
is typically created by calling
Bootstrap.virtualMachineManager()
.
Most of the methods within this package can throw the unchecked exception
VMDisconnectedException
.
Methods may be added to the interfaces in the JDI packages in future
 releases. Existing packages may be renamed if the JDI becomes a standard
 extension.
