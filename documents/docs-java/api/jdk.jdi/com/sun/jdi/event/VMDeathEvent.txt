Interface VMDeathEvent
All Superinterfaces:
Event
,
Mirror
public interface
VMDeathEvent
extends
Event
Notification of target VM termination.
 This event occurs if the target VM terminates before the
 VM disconnects (
VMDisconnectEvent
).
 Thus, this event will NOT occur if external forces terminate
 the connection (e.g. a crash) or if the connection is intentionally
 terminated with
VirtualMachine.dispose()
On VM termination, a single unsolicited VMDeathEvent will always be sent with a
suspend policy
of
SUSPEND_NONE
.
 Additional VMDeathEvents will be sent in the same event set if they are
 requested with a
VMDeathRequest
.
The VM is still intact and can be queried at the point this
 event was initiated but immediately thereafter it is not
 considered intact and cannot be queried.
 Note: If the enclosing
EventSet
has a
suspend policy
other than
SUSPEND_ALL
the initiating point may be long past.
All VMDeathEvents will be in a single
EventSet
,
 no other events will be in the event set. A resume
 must occur to continue execution after any event set which
 performs suspensions - in this case to allow proper shutdown.
