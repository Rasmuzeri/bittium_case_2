Event
Notification of a class prepare in the target VM. See the JVM
 specification for a definition of class preparation. Class prepare
 events are not generated for primitive classes (for example,
 java.lang.Integer.TYPE).

Method Details
thread
ThreadReference
thread
()
Returns the thread in which this event has occurred.
In rare cases, this event may occur in a debugger system
 thread within the target VM. Debugger threads take precautions
 to prevent these events, but they cannot be avoided under some
 conditions, especially for some subclasses of
Error
.
 If the event was generated by a debugger system thread, the
 value returned by this method is null, and if the requested
 suspend policy for the event was
EventRequest.SUSPEND_EVENT_THREAD
,
 all threads will be suspended instead, and the
EventSet.suspendPolicy()
will reflect this change.
Note that the discussion above does not apply to system threads
 created by the target VM during its normal (non-debug) operation.
Returns:
a
ThreadReference
which mirrors the event's thread in
 the target VM, or null in the rare cases described above.
referenceType
ReferenceType
referenceType
()
Returns the reference type for which this event was generated.
Returns:
a
ReferenceType
which mirrors the class, interface, or
 array which has been linked.
