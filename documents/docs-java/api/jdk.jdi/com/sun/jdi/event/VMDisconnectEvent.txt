Event
Notification of disconnection from target VM.
 May be caused by normal termination of a VM,
 VM termination by uncaught exception or other error,
 debugger action (

or
VirtualMachine.exit(int)
) or by external events
 (for example, target process termination by the
 operating system, transport termination, etc).
If the target VM terminates before the disconnection, this event
 will be preceded by a
VMDeathEvent
.
This event is always sent.
 There is no corresponding
EventRequest
.
 The enclosing singleton
EventSet
always has a
 suspend policy of
EventRequest.SUSPEND_NONE
.

1.3
