Several
Event
objects may be created at a given time by
 the target
VirtualMachine
. For example, there may be
 more than one
BreakpointRequest
for a given
Location
or you might single step to the same location as a
 BreakpointRequest.  These
Event
objects are delivered
 together as an EventSet.  For uniformity, an EventSet is always used
 to deliver
Event
objects.  EventSets are delivered by
 the
EventQueue
.
 EventSets are unmodifiable.
Associated with the issuance of an event set, suspensions may
 have occurred in the target VM.  These suspensions correspond
 with the
suspend policy
.
 To assure matching resumes occur, it is recommended,
 where possible,
 to complete the processing of an event set with
EventSet.resume()
.
The events that are grouped in an EventSet are restricted in the
 following ways:
Always singleton sets:
VMStartEvent
VMDisconnectEvent
Only with other VMDeathEvents:
VMDeathEvent
Only with other ThreadStartEvents for the same thread:
ThreadStartEvent
Only with other ThreadDeathEvents for the same thread:
ThreadDeathEvent
Only with other ClassPrepareEvents for the same class:
ClassPrepareEvent
Only with other ClassUnloadEvents for the same class:
ClassUnloadEvent
Only with other AccessWatchpointEvents for the same field access:
AccessWatchpointEvent
Only with other ModificationWatchpointEvents for the same field
 modification:
ModificationWatchpointEvent
Only with other ExceptionEvents for the same exception occurrence:
ExceptionEvent
Only with other MethodExitEvents for the same method exit:
MethodExitEvent
Only with other Monitor contended enter events for the same monitor object:
Monitor Contended Enter Event
Only with other Monitor contended entered events for the same monitor object:
Monitor Contended Entered Event
Only with other Monitor wait events for the same monitor object:
Monitor Wait Event
Only with other Monitor waited events for the same monitor object:
Monitor Waited Event
Only with other members of this group, at the same location
 and in the same thread:
BreakpointEvent
StepEvent
MethodEntryEvent

Method Details
suspendPolicy
int
suspendPolicy
()
Returns the policy used to suspend threads in the target VM
 for this event set. This policy is selected from the suspend
 policies for each event's request; the target VM chooses the
 policy which suspends the most threads.  The target VM suspends
 threads according to that policy and that policy is returned here.
 See
EventRequest
for the possible policy values.
In rare cases, the suspend policy may differ from the requested
 value if a
ClassPrepareEvent
has occurred in a
 debugger system thread. See
ClassPrepareEvent.thread()
for details.
Returns:
the suspendPolicy which is either
SUSPEND_ALL
,
SUSPEND_EVENT_THREAD
or
SUSPEND_NONE
.
eventIterator
EventIterator
eventIterator
()
Return an iterator specific to
Event
objects.
resume
void
resume
()
Resumes threads suspended by this event set. If the
suspendPolicy()
is
EventRequest.SUSPEND_ALL
, a call to this method is equivalent to
VirtualMachine.resume()
. If the suspend policy is
EventRequest.SUSPEND_EVENT_THREAD
,
 a call to this method is equivalent to
ThreadReference.resume()
for the event thread.
 Otherwise, a call to this method is a no-op.
