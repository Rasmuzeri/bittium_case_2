ThreadDeathEvent
extends
Event
Notification of a completed thread in the target VM. The
 notification is generated by the dying thread before it terminates.
 Because of this timing, it is possible
 for
VirtualMachine.allThreads()
to return this thread
 after this event is received.
Note that this event gives no information
 about the lifetime of the thread object. It may or may not be collected
 soon depending on what references exist in the target VM.
