Interface ThreadStartEvent
All Superinterfaces:

public interface
ThreadStartEvent
extends
Event
Notification of a new running thread in the target VM.
 The new thread can be the result of a call to
Thread.start()
or the result of
 attaching a new thread to the VM though JNI. The
 notification is generated by the new thread some time before
 its execution starts.
 Because of this timing, it is possible to receive other events
 for the thread before this event is received. (Notably,
MethodEntryEvent
s and
MethodExitEvent
s might occur
 during thread initialization.)
 It is also possible for
VirtualMachine.allThreads()
to return
 a new started thread before this event is received.
Note that this event gives no information
 about the creation of the thread object which may have happened
 much earlier, depending on the VM being debugged.
