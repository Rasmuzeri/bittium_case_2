Package com.sun.jdi.event
package
com.sun.jdi.event
This package defines JDI events and event processing.
 An
Event
is always a member of an
EventSet
, which
 is retrieved from the
EventQueue
.
 Examples of Events include
"breakpoints events"
,
"thread creation events"
and
"virtual machine death event"
.
  With the exception
 of termination events, all events received must be requested with an
"EventRequest"
.  The
com.sun.jdi.request
package defines event requests and event
 request management.
Methods may be added to the interfaces in the JDI packages in future
 releases. Existing packages may be renamed if the JDI becomes a standard
 extension.
