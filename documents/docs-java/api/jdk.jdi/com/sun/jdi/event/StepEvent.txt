StepEvent
extends
LocatableEvent
Notification of step completion in the target VM.
 The step event is generated immediately before the code at its location
 is executed. Thus, if the step is entering a new method (as might occur
 with
StepRequest.STEP_INTO
)
 the location of the event is the first instruction of the method.
 When a step leaves a method, the location of the event will be the
 first instruction after the call in the calling method; note that
 this location may not be at a line boundary, even if
StepRequest.STEP_LINE
was used.

1.3
