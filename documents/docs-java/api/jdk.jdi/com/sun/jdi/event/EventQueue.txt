Package
com.sun.jdi.event
Interface EventQueue
All Superinterfaces:
Mirror
public interface
EventQueue
extends
Mirror
Manager of incoming debugger events for a target VM.
 Events are always grouped in
EventSet
s.
 EventSets generated by the debugger back end can be read
 here. There is one instance of EventQueue assigned to a particular
VirtualMachine
.
Some events cause the suspension of the target VM - event requests
 (
com.sun.jdi.request
) with a
suspend policy
of
SUSPEND_ALL
or
SUSPEND_EVENT_THREAD
and sometimes
VMStartEvent
.
 If these suspensions are not resumed the target VM will hang.
 Thus, it is always good policy to
remove()
every EventSet from the event queue until
 an EventSet containing a
VMDisconnectEvent
is read.
 Unless
resume
is
 being handled in another way, each EventSet should invoke
EventSet.resume()
.
