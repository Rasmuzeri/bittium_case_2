MethodEntryEvent
extends
LocatableEvent
Notification of a method invocation in the target VM. This event
 occurs after entry into the invoked method and before any
 code has executed.
 Method entry events are generated for both native and non-native
 methods.
In some VMs method entry events can occur for a particular thread
 before its
ThreadStartEvent
occurs if methods are called
 as part of the thread's initialization.
