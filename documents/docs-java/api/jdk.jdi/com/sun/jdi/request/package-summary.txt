Package com.sun.jdi.request
package
com.sun.jdi.request
This package is used to request that a JDI
 event be sent under specified conditions.
 With the exception of termination events, which are
 always sent, there is one kind of
EventRequest
for each kind of
Event
- for example,
BreakpointRequest
is used to request a
BreakpointEvent
.
 Event requests are created by the
EventRequestManager
.
 Events and event processing are defined in the
com.sun.jdi.event
package.
Methods may be added to the interfaces in the JDI packages in future
 releases. Existing packages may be renamed if the JDI becomes a standard
 extension.
