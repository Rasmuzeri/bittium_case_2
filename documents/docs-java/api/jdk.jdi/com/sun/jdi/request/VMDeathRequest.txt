Interface VMDeathRequest
All Superinterfaces:
EventRequest
,
Mirror
public interface
VMDeathRequest
extends
EventRequest
Request for notification when the target VM terminates.
 When an enabled VMDeathRequest is satisfied, an
event set
containing a
VMDeathEvent
will be placed on the
EventQueue
.
 The collection of existing VMDeathRequests is
 managed by the
EventRequestManager
Even without creating a VMDeathRequest, a single
 unsolicited VMDeathEvent will be sent with a
suspend policy
of
SUSPEND_NONE
.
 This request would typically be created so that a
 VMDeathEvent with a suspend policy of
SUSPEND_ALL
will be sent.  This event can be used to assure
 completion of any processing which requires the VM
 to be alive (e.g. event processing).  Note: the
 unsolicited VMDeathEvent will still be sent.

1.4
