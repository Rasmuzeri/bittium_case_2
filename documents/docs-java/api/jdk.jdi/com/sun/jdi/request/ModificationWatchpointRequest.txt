Interface ModificationWatchpointRequest
All Superinterfaces:

WatchpointRequest
public interface
ModificationWatchpointRequest
extends
WatchpointRequest
Request for notification when a field is set.
 This event will be triggered when a value is assigned to the specified
 field with a Java programming
 language statement (assignment, increment, etc) or by a
 Java Native Interface (JNI) set function (
Set<Type>Field,
 SetStatic<Type>Field
).
 Setting a field to a value which is the same as the previous value
 still triggers this event.
 Modification by JDI does not trigger this event.
 When an enabled ModificationWatchpointRequest is satisfied, an
event set
containing a
ModificationWatchpointEvent
will be placed on the
EventQueue
.
 The collection of existing watchpoints is
 managed by the
EventRequestManager
.

1.3
