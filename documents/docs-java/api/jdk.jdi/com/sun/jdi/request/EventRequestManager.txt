 possible to determine whether it is truly caught. See
ExceptionEvent.catchLocation()
for
 details.

- If non-null, specifies that exceptions which are
                instances of refType will be reported. Note: this
                will include instances of sub-types.  If null,
                all instances will be reported

createStepRequest
StepRequest
createStepRequest
(
ThreadReference
thread,
 int size,
 int depth)
Creates a new disabled
StepRequest
.
 The new event request is added to the list managed by this
 EventRequestManager. Use
EventRequest.enable()
to
 activate this event request.
The returned request will control stepping only in the specified
thread
; all other threads will be unaffected.
 A
size
value of
StepRequest.STEP_MIN
will generate a
 step event each time the code index changes. It represents the
 smallest step size available and often maps to the instruction
 level.
 A
size
value of
StepRequest.STEP_LINE
will generate a
 step event each time the source line changes unless line number information is not available,
 in which case a STEP_MIN will be done instead.  For example, no line number information is
 available during the execution of a method that has been rendered obsolete by
 by a
VirtualMachine.redefineClasses(java.util.Map<? extends com.sun.jdi.ReferenceType, byte[]>)
operation.
 A
depth
value of
StepRequest.STEP_INTO
will generate
 step events in any called methods.  A
depth
value
 of
StepRequest.STEP_OVER
restricts step events to the current frame
 or caller frames. A
depth
value of
StepRequest.STEP_OUT
restricts step events to caller frames only. All depth
 restrictions are relative to the call stack immediately before the
 step takes place.
Only one pending step request is allowed per thread.
Note that a typical debugger will want to cancel stepping
 after the first step is detected.  Thus a next line method
 would do the following:
EventRequestManager mgr = myVM.{@link VirtualMachine#eventRequestManager eventRequestManager}();
     StepRequest request = mgr.createStepRequest(myThread,
                                                 StepRequest.{@link StepRequest#STEP_LINE STEP_LINE},
                                                 StepRequest.{@link StepRequest#STEP_OVER STEP_OVER});
     request.{@link EventRequest#addCountFilter addCountFilter}(1);  // next step only
     request.enable();
     myVM.{@link VirtualMachine#resume resume}();
Parameters:
thread
- the thread in which to step
size
- the step size
depth
- the step depth
Returns:
the created
StepRequest
Throws:
DuplicateRequestException
- if there is already a pending
 step request for the specified thread.
IllegalArgumentException
- if the size or depth arguments
 contain illegal values.
createBreakpointRequest
BreakpointRequest
createBreakpointRequest
(
Location
location)
Creates a new disabled
BreakpointRequest
.
 The given
Location
must have a valid
 (that is, non-negative) code index. The new
 breakpoint is added to the list managed by this
 EventRequestManager. Multiple breakpoints at the
 same location are permitted. Use
EventRequest.enable()
to
 activate this event request.
Parameters:
location
- the location of the new breakpoint.
Returns:
the created
BreakpointRequest
Throws:
NativeMethodException
- if location is within a native method.
createAccessWatchpointRequest
AccessWatchpointRequest
createAccessWatchpointRequest
(
Field
field)
Creates a new disabled watchpoint which watches accesses to the
 specified field. The new
 watchpoint is added to the list managed by this
 EventRequestManager. Multiple watchpoints on the
 same field are permitted.
 Use
EventRequest.enable()
to
 activate this event request.
Not all target virtual machines support this operation.
 Use
VirtualMachine.canWatchFieldAccess()
to determine if the operation is supported.
Parameters:
field
- the field to watch
Returns:
the created watchpoint
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException
- if
 the target virtual machine does not support this
 operation.
createModificationWatchpointRequest
ModificationWatchpointRequest
createModificationWatchpointRequest
(
Field
field)
Creates a new disabled watchpoint which watches accesses to the
 specified field. The new
 watchpoint is added to the list managed by this
 EventRequestManager. Multiple watchpoints on the
 same field are permitted.
 Use
EventRequest.enable()
to
 activate this event request.
Not all target virtual machines support this operation.
 Use
VirtualMachine.canWatchFieldModification()
to determine if the operation is supported.
Parameters:
field
- the field to watch
Returns:
the created watchpoint
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException
- if
 the target virtual machine does not support this
 operation.
createVMDeathRequest
VMDeathRequest
createVMDeathRequest
()
Creates a new disabled
VMDeathRequest
.
 The new request is added to the list managed by this
 EventRequestManager.
 Use
EventRequest.enable()
to
 activate this event request.
This request (if enabled) will cause a
VMDeathEvent
to be sent on termination of the target VM.
A VMDeathRequest with a suspend policy of
SUSPEND_ALL
can be used to assure processing of incoming
SUSPEND_NONE
or
SUSPEND_EVENT_THREAD
events before VM death.  If all event processing is being
 done in the same thread as event sets are being read,
 enabling the request is all that is needed since the VM
 will be suspended until the
EventSet
containing the
VMDeathEvent
is resumed.
Not all target virtual machines support this operation.
 Use
VirtualMachine.canRequestVMDeathEvent()
to determine if the operation is supported.
Returns:
the created request
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException
- if
 the target VM does not support this
 operation.
Since:
1.4
deleteEventRequest
void
deleteEventRequest
(
EventRequest
eventRequest)
Removes an eventRequest. The eventRequest is disabled and
 the removed from the requests managed by this
 EventRequestManager. Once the eventRequest is deleted, no
 operations (for example,
EventRequest.setEnabled(boolean)
)
 are permitted - attempts to do so will generally cause an
InvalidRequestStateException
.
 No other eventRequests are effected.
Because this method changes the underlying lists of event
 requests, attempting to directly delete from a list returned
 by a request accessor (e.g. below):
Iterator iter = requestManager.stepRequests().iterator();
   while (iter.hasNext()) {
      requestManager.deleteEventRequest(iter.next());
  }
may cause a
ConcurrentModificationException
.
 Instead use
deleteEventRequests(List)
or copy the list before iterating.
Parameters:
eventRequest
- the eventRequest to remove
deleteEventRequests
void
deleteEventRequests
(
List
<? extends
EventRequest
> eventRequests)
Removes a list of
EventRequest
s.
Parameters:
eventRequests
- the list of eventRequests to remove
See Also:
