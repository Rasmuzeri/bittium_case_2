ThreadReference
thread)
Restricts the events generated by this request to those in
 the given thread.
Parameters:
thread
- the thread to filter on.

ReferenceType
refType)
Restricts the events generated by this request to those whose
 location is in the given reference type or any of its subtypes.
 An event will be generated for any location in a reference type
 that can be safely cast to the given reference type.
Parameters:
refType
- the reference type to filter on.
Throws:
InvalidRequestStateException
- if this request is currently
 enabled or has been deleted.
 Filters may be added only to disabled requests.
addClassFilter
void
addClassFilter
(
String
classPattern)
Restricts the events generated by this request to those
 whose location is in a class whose name matches a restricted
 regular expression. Regular expressions are limited
 to exact matches and patterns that begin with '*' or end with '*';
 for example, "*.Foo" or "java.*".
Parameters:
classPattern
- the pattern String to filter for.
Throws:
InvalidRequestStateException
- if this request is currently
 enabled or has been deleted.
 Filters may be added only to disabled requests.
