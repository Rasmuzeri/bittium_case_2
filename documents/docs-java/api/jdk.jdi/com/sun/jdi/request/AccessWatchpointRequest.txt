public interface
AccessWatchpointRequest
extends
WatchpointRequest
Request for notification when the contents of a field are accessed
 in the target VM.
 This event will be triggered when the specified field is accessed
 by Java programming language code or by a
 Java Native Interface (JNI) get function (
Get<Type>Field,
 GetStatic<Type>Field
).
 Access by JDI does not trigger this event.
 When an enabled AccessWatchpointRequest is satisfied, an
event set
containing an
AccessWatchpointEvent
will be placed
 on the
EventQueue
.
 The collection of existing ExceptionRequests is
 managed by the
EventRequestManager
The collection of existing watchpoints is
 managed by the
EventRequestManager
.
Note that the modification
 of a Field is not considered an access.
