Interface ClassPrepareRequest
All Superinterfaces:
EventRequest
,
Mirror
public interface
ClassPrepareRequest
extends
EventRequest
Request for notification when a class is prepared in the target VM.
 When an enabled ClassPrepareRequest is satisfied, an
event set
containing a
ClassPrepareEvent
will be placed on the
EventQueue
.
 The collection of existing ClassPrepareRequests is
 managed by the
EventRequestManager
Class preparation is defined in the Java Virtual Machine
 Specification.

Method Details
addClassFilter
void
addClassFilter
(
ReferenceType
refType)
Restricts the events generated by this request to be the
 preparation of the given reference type and any subtypes.
 An event will be generated for any prepared reference type that can
 be safely cast to the given reference type.
Parameters:
refType
- the reference type to filter on.
Throws:
InvalidRequestStateException
- if this request is currently
 enabled or has been deleted.
 Filters may be added only to disabled requests.
addClassFilter
void
addClassFilter
(
String
classPattern)
Restricts the events generated by this request to the
 preparation of reference types whose name matches this restricted
 regular expression. Regular expressions are limited
 to exact matches and patterns that begin with '*' or end with '*';
 for example, "*.Foo" or "java.*".
Parameters:
classPattern
- the pattern String to filter for.
Throws:
InvalidRequestStateException
- if this request is currently
 enabled or has been deleted.
 Filters may be added only to disabled requests.
addClassExclusionFilter
void
addClassExclusionFilter
(
String
classPattern)
Restricts the events generated by this request to the
 preparation of reference types whose name does
not
match
 this restricted regular expression. Regular expressions are limited
 to exact matches and patterns that begin with '*' or end with '*';
 for example, "*.Foo" or "java.*".
Parameters:
classPattern
- the pattern String to filter against.
Throws:
InvalidRequestStateException
- if this request is currently
 enabled or has been deleted.
 Filters may be added only to disabled requests.
addSourceNameFilter
void
addSourceNameFilter
(
String
sourceNamePattern)
Restricts the events generated by this request to the
 preparation of reference types for which the restricted regular
 expression 'sourceNamePattern' matches one of the 'sourceNames' for
 the reference type being prepared.
 That is, if refType is the ReferenceType being prepared,
 then there exists at least one stratum, call it 'someStratum'
 on the list returned by
     refType.availableStrata();

 such that a name on the list returned by
     refType.sourceNames(someStratam)

 matches 'sourceNamePattern'.
 Regular expressions are limited
 to exact matches and patterns that begin with '*' or end with '*';
 for example, "*.Foo" or "java.*".
Not all targets support this operation.
 Use
VirtualMachine.canUseSourceNameFilters()
to determine if the operation is supported.
Parameters:
sourceNamePattern
- the pattern string to filter for.
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException
- if
 the target virtual machine does not support this
 operation.
InvalidRequestStateException
- if this request is currently
 enabled or has been deleted.
 Filters may be added only to disabled requests.
