Method Details
modifiers
int
modifiers
()
Returns the Java programming language modifiers, encoded
 in an integer.
The modifier encodings are defined in
The Java Virtual Machine Specification
in the
access_flag
tables for classes(section 4.1), fields(section 4.5), and methods(section 4.6).
isPrivate
boolean
isPrivate
()
Determines if this object mirrors a private item.
 For
ArrayType
, the return value depends on the
 array component type. For primitive arrays the return value
 is always false. For object arrays, the return value is the
 same as would be returned for the component type.
 For primitive classes, such as
Integer.TYPE
,
 the return value is always false.
Returns:
true
for items with private access;
false
otherwise.
isPackagePrivate
boolean
isPackagePrivate
()
Determines if this object mirrors a package private item.
 A package private item is declared with no access specifier.
 For
ArrayType
, the return value depends on the
 array component type. For primitive arrays the return value
 is always false. For object arrays, the return value is the
 same as would be returned for the component type.
 For primitive classes, such as
Integer.TYPE
,
 the return value is always false.
Returns:
true
for items with package private access;
false
otherwise.
isProtected
boolean
isProtected
()
Determines if this object mirrors a protected item.
 For
ArrayType
, the return value depends on the
 array component type. For primitive arrays the return value
 is always false. For object arrays, the return value is the
 same as would be returned for the component type.
 For primitive classes, such as
Integer.TYPE
,
 the return value is always false.
Returns:
true
for items with private access;
false
otherwise.
