jdk.dynalink.linker
Interface LinkRequest
All Known Implementing Classes:
SimpleLinkRequest
public interface
LinkRequest
Represents a request to link a particular invocation at a particular call
 site. Instances of these requests will be constructed and passed to all
GuardingDynamicLinker
objects managed by the
DynamicLinker
that is trying to link the call site.
Method Summary

Abstract Methods
Modifier and Type
Method
Description
Object
[]
getArguments
()
Returns the arguments for the invocation being linked.
CallSiteDescriptor
getCallSiteDescriptor
()
Returns the call site descriptor for the call site being linked.
Object
getReceiver
()
Returns the first argument for the invocation being linked; this is
 typically the receiver object.
boolean
isCallSiteUnstable
()
Returns true if the call site is considered unstable, that is, it has been relinked more times than was
 specified in
DynamicLinkerFactory.setUnstableRelinkThreshold(int)
.
LinkRequest
replaceArguments
(
CallSiteDescriptor
callSiteDescriptor,
Object
... arguments)
Returns a request identical to this one with call site descriptor and arguments replaced with the ones specified.
Method Details
getCallSiteDescriptor
CallSiteDescriptor
getCallSiteDescriptor
()
Returns the call site descriptor for the call site being linked.
Returns:
the call site descriptor for the call site being linked.
getArguments
Object
[]
getArguments
()
Returns the arguments for the invocation being linked. The returned array
 must be a clone; modifications to it must not affect the arguments in
 this request.
Returns:
the arguments for the invocation being linked.
getReceiver
Object
getReceiver
()
Returns the first argument for the invocation being linked; this is
 typically the receiver object. This is a shorthand for
getArguments()[0]
that also avoids the cloning of the arguments
 array.
Returns:
the receiver object.
isCallSiteUnstable
boolean
isCallSiteUnstable
()
Returns true if the call site is considered unstable, that is, it has been relinked more times than was
 specified in
DynamicLinkerFactory.setUnstableRelinkThreshold(int)
. Linkers should use this as a
 hint to prefer producing linkage that is more stable (its guard fails less frequently), even if that assumption
 causes a less effective version of an operation to be linked. This is just a hint, though, and linkers are
 allowed to ignore this property.
Returns:
true if the call site is considered unstable.
replaceArguments
LinkRequest
replaceArguments
(
CallSiteDescriptor
callSiteDescriptor,
Object
... arguments)
Returns a request identical to this one with call site descriptor and arguments replaced with the ones specified.
Parameters:
callSiteDescriptor
- the new call site descriptor
arguments
- the new arguments
Returns:
a new request identical to this one, except with the call site descriptor and arguments replaced with the
 specified ones.
