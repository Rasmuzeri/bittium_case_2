A class acting as a supplier of guarding dynamic linkers that can be
 automatically loaded by other language runtimes. Language runtimes wishing
 to export their own linkers should subclass this class and implement the
Supplier.get()
method to return a list of exported linkers and declare the
 subclass in
/META-INF/services/jdk.dynalink.linker.GuardingDynamicLinkerExporter
resource of their distribution (typically, JAR file) so that dynamic linker
 factories can discover them using the
ServiceLoader
mechanism. Note
 that instantiating this class is tied to a security check for the
RuntimePermission("dynalink.exportLinkersAutomatically")
when a
 security manager is present, to ensure that only trusted runtimes can
 automatically export their linkers into other runtimes.

Field Details
AUTOLOAD_PERMISSION_NAME
public static final
String
AUTOLOAD_PERMISSION_NAME
The name of the runtime permission for creating instances of this class.
 Granting this permission to a language runtime allows it to export its
 linkers for automatic loading into other language runtimes.

Constructor Details
GuardingDynamicLinkerExporter
protected
GuardingDynamicLinkerExporter
()
Creates a new linker exporter. If there is a security manager installed
 checks for the
RuntimePermission("dynalink.exportLinkersAutomatically")
runtime
 permission. This ensures only language runtimes granted this permission
 will be allowed to export their linkers for automatic loading.
Throws:
SecurityException
- if the necessary runtime permission is not
 granted.
