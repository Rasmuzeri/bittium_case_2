Interface Operation
All Known Implementing Classes:
NamedOperation
,
NamespaceOperation
,
StandardOperation
public interface
Operation
An object that describes a dynamic operation. Dynalink defines a set of
 standard operations with the
StandardOperation
class, as well as a
 way to express the target
namespace(s)
of an operation
 on an object using
NamespaceOperation
and finally a way to attach
 a fixed target name to an operation using
NamedOperation
.
 When presenting examples in this documentation, we will refer to standard
 operations using their name (e.g.
GET
), to namespace operations
 by separating their base operation with a colon from their namespace
 (e.g.
GET:PROPERTY
), or in case of multiple namespaces we will
 further separate those with the vertical line character (e.g.
GET:PROPERTY|ELEMENT
), and finally we will refer to named operations
 by separating the base operation and the name with the colon character (e.g.
GET:PROPERTY|ELEMENT:color
).
