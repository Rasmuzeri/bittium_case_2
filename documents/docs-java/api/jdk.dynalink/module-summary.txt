jdk.dynalink
Defines the API for dynamic linking of high-level operations on objects.
Dynalink is a library for dynamic linking of high-level operations on objects.
 These operations include "read a property",
 "write a property", "invoke a function" and so on. Dynalink is primarily
 useful for implementing programming languages where at least some expressions
 have dynamic types (that is, types that can not be decided statically), and
 the operations on dynamic types are expressed as
call sites
. These call sites will be
 linked to appropriate target
method handles
at run time based on actual types of the values the expressions evaluated to.
 These can change between invocations, necessitating relinking the call site
 multiple times to accommodate new types; Dynalink handles all that and more.
Dynalink supports implementation of programming languages with object models
 that differ (even radically) from the JVM's class-based model and have their
 custom type conversions.
Dynalink is closely related to, and relies on, the
java.lang.invoke
package.
While
java.lang.invoke
provides a low level API for dynamic linking
 of
invokedynamic
call sites, it does not provide a way to express
 higher level operations on objects, nor methods that implement them. These
 operations are the usual ones in object-oriented environments: property
 access, access of elements of collections, invocation of methods and
 constructors (potentially with multiple dispatch, e.g. link- and run-time
 equivalents of Java overloaded method resolution). These are all functions
 that are normally desired in a language on the JVM. If a language is
 statically typed and its type system matches that of the JVM, it can
 accomplish this with use of the usual invocation, field access, etc.
 instructions (e.g.
invokevirtual
,
getfield
). However, if the
 language is dynamic (hence, types of some expressions are not known until
 evaluated at run time), or its object model or type system don't match
 closely that of the JVM, then it should use
invokedynamic
call sites
 instead and let Dynalink manage them.
Example
Dynalink is probably best explained by an example showing its use. Let's
 suppose you have a program in a language where you don't have to declare the
 type of an object and you want to access a property on it:
var color = obj.color;
If you generated a Java class to represent the above one-line program, its
 bytecode would look something like this:
aload 2 // load "obj" on stack
 invokedynamic "GET:PROPERTY:color"(Object)Object // invoke property getter on object of unknown type
 astore 3 // store the return value into local variable "color"
In order to link the
invokedynamic
instruction, we need a bootstrap
 method. A minimalist bootstrap method with Dynalink could look like this:
import java.lang.invoke.*;
 import jdk.dynalink.*;
 import jdk.dynalink.support.*;

 class MyLanguageRuntime {
     private static final DynamicLinker dynamicLinker = new DynamicLinkerFactory().createLinker();

     public static CallSite bootstrap(MethodHandles.Lookup lookup, String name, MethodType type) {
         return dynamicLinker.link(
             new SimpleRelinkableCallSite(
                 new CallSiteDescriptor(lookup, parseOperation(name), type)));
     }

     private static Operation parseOperation(String name) {
         ...
     }
 }
There are several objects of significance in the above code snippet:
DynamicLinker
is the main object in Dynalink, it
 coordinates the linking of call sites to method handles that implement the
 operations named in them. It is configured and created using a
DynamicLinkerFactory
.
When the bootstrap method is invoked, it needs to create a
CallSite
object. In Dynalink, these call sites need
 to additionally implement the
RelinkableCallSite
interface. "Relinkable" here alludes to the fact that if the call site
 encounters objects of different types at run time, its target will be changed
 to a method handle that can perform the operation on the newly encountered
 type.
SimpleRelinkableCallSite
and
ChainedCallSite
(not used in the above example)
 are two implementations already provided by the library.
Dynalink uses
CallSiteDescriptor
objects to
 preserve the parameters to the bootstrap method: the lookup and the method type,
 as it will need them whenever it needs to relink a call site.
Dynalink uses
Operation
objects to express
 dynamic operations. It does not prescribe how would you encode the operations
 in your call site, though. That is why in the above example the
parseOperation
function is left empty, and you would be expected to
 provide the code to parse the string
"GET:PROPERTY:color"
in the call site's name into a named property getter operation object as
StandardOperation.GET.withNamespace(StandardNamespace.PROPERTY).named("color")
.
What can you already do with the above setup?
DynamicLinkerFactory
by default creates a
DynamicLinker
that can link Java objects with the
 usual Java semantics. If you have these three simple classes:
public class A {
     public String color;
     public A(String color) { this.color = color; }
 }

 public class B {
     private String color;
     public B(String color) { this.color = color; }
     public String getColor() { return color; }
 }

 public class C {
     private int color;
     public C(int color) { this.color = color; }
     public int getColor() { return color; }
 }
and you somehow create their instances and pass them to your call site in your
 programming language:
for each(var obj in [new A("red"), new B("green"), new C(0x0000ff)]) {
     print(obj.color);
 }
then on first invocation, Dynalink will link the
.color
getter
 operation to a field getter for
A.color
, on second invocation it will
 relink it to
B.getColor()
returning a
String
, and finally on
 third invocation it will relink it to
C.getColor()
returning an
int
.
 The
SimpleRelinkableCallSite
we used above only remembers the linkage
 for the last encountered type (it implements what is known as a
monomorphic
 inline cache
). Another already provided implementation,
ChainedCallSite
will remember linkages for
 several different types (it is a
polymorphic inline cache
) and is
 probably a better choice in serious applications.
Dynalink and bytecode creation
CallSite
objects are usually created as part of bootstrapping
invokedynamic
instructions in bytecode. Hence, Dynalink is typically
 used as part of language runtimes that compile programs into Java
.class
bytecode format. Dynalink does not address the aspects of
 either creating bytecode classes or loading them into the JVM. That said,
 Dynalink can also be used without bytecode compilation (e.g. in language
 interpreters) by creating
CallSite
objects explicitly and associating
 them with representations of dynamic operations in the interpreted program
 (e.g. a typical representation would be some node objects in a syntax tree).
Available operations
Dynalink defines several standard operations in its
StandardOperation
class. The linker for Java
 objects can link all of these operations, and you are encouraged to at
 minimum support and use these operations in your language too. The
 standard operations
GET
and
SET
need to be combined with
 at least one
Namespace
to be useful, e.g. to express a
 property getter, you'd use
StandardOperation.GET.withNamespace(StandardNamespace.PROPERTY)
.
 Dynalink defines three standard namespaces in the
StandardNamespace
class.
 To associate a fixed name with an operation, you can use
NamedOperation
as in the previous example:
StandardOperation.GET.withNamespace(StandardNamespace.PROPERTY).named("color")
expresses a getter for the property named "color".
Operations on multiple namespaces
Some languages might not have separate namespaces on objects for
 properties, elements, and methods, and a source language construct might
 address several of them at once. Dynalink supports specifying multiple
Namespace
objects with
NamespaceOperation
.
Language-specific linkers
Languages that define their own object model different than the JVM
 class-based model and/or use their own type conversions will need to create
 their own language-specific linkers. See the
jdk.dynalink.linker
package and specifically the
GuardingDynamicLinker
interface to get started.
Dynalink and Java objects
The
DynamicLinker
objects created by
DynamicLinkerFactory
by
 default contain an internal instance of
BeansLinker
, which is a language-specific linker
 that implements the usual Java semantics for all of the above operations and
 can link any Java object that no other language-specific linker has managed
 to link. This way, all language runtimes have built-in interoperability with
 ordinary Java objects. See
BeansLinker
for details
 on how it links the various operations.
Cross-language interoperability
A
DynamicLinkerFactory
can be configured with a
class
 loader
. It will try to instantiate all
GuardingDynamicLinkerExporter
classes visible to
 that class loader and compose the linkers they provide into the
DynamicLinker
it creates. This allows for interoperability between
 languages: if you have two language runtimes A and B deployed in your JVM and
 they export their linkers through the above mechanism, language runtime A
 will have a language-specific linker instance from B and vice versa inside
 their
DynamicLinker
objects. This means that if an object from
 language runtime B gets passed to code from language runtime A, the linker
 from B will get a chance to link the call site in A when it encounters the
 object from B.
