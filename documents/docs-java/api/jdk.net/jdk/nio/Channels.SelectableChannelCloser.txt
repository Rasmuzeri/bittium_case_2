Description
void
implCloseChannel
(
SelectableChannel
sc)
Closes a selectable channel.
void
implReleaseChannel
(
SelectableChannel
sc)
Release the file descriptor and any resources for a selectable
 channel that closed while registered with one or more
Selector
s.
Method Details
implCloseChannel
void
implCloseChannel
(
SelectableChannel
sc)
throws
IOException
Closes a selectable channel.
This method is invoked by the channel's close method in order to
 perform the actual work of closing the channel. This method is only
 invoked if the channel has not yet been closed, and it is never
 invoked more than once by the channel's close implementation.
An implementation of this method must arrange for any other
 thread that is blocked in an I/O operation upon the channel to return
 immediately, either by throwing an exception or by returning normally.
 If the channel is
registered
with one or more
Selector
s then
 the file descriptor should not be released until the
implReleaseChannel
method is invoked.
Parameters:
sc
- The selectable channel
Throws:
IOException
- If an I/O error occurs while closing the file descriptor

AbstractInterruptibleChannel.implCloseChannel()
implReleaseChannel
void
implReleaseChannel
(
SelectableChannel
sc)
throws
IOException
Release the file descriptor and any resources for a selectable
 channel that closed while registered with one or more
Selector
s.
This method is for cases where a channel is closed when
registered
with one or more
Selector
s. A channel may remain registered
 for some time after it is closed. This method is invoked when the
 channel is eventually deregistered from the last
Selector
that it was registered with. It is invoked at most once.
API Note:
This method is invoked while synchronized on the selector
 and its selected-key set. Great care must be taken to avoid deadlocks
 with other threads that also synchronize on these objects.
Parameters:
sc
- The closed selectable channel
Throws:
IOException
- If an I/O error occurs
