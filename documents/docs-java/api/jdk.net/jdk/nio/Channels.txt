Method Details
readWriteSelectableChannel
public static
SelectableChannel
readWriteSelectableChannel
(
FileDescriptor
fd,
Channels.SelectableChannelCloser
closer)
Creates a selectable channel to a file descriptor that supports an
operation-set
of
OP_READ
and
OP_WRITE
. The selectable channel will be
 created by the default
SelectorProvider
.
The given file descriptor is a socket or resource that can be
 multiplexed by a
Selector
for read and write
 readiness. Great care is required to coordinate direct use of the file
 descriptor with the use of the selectable channel. In particular,
 changing the blocking mode or closing the file descriptor without careful
 coordination will result in unspecified and unsafe side effects. The
 given
SelectableChannelCloser
is invoked to
 close the file descriptor and to coordinate the closing when the channel
 is registered with a
Selector
.
If there is a security manager set then its
checkRead
and
checkWrite
methods
 are invoked to check that the caller has permission to both read from and
 write to the file descriptor.
Implementation Note:
This method throws
UnsupportedOperationException
if
 the default
SelectorProvider
is not the JDK built-in implementation.
Parameters:
fd
- The file descriptor
closer
- The object to close the channel
Returns:
The selectable channel
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- If the file descriptor is not
valid
SecurityException
- If denied by the security manager
