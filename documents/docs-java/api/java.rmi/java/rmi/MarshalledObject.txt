Class MarshalledObject<T>
java.lang.Object
java.rmi.MarshalledObject<T>
Type Parameters:
T
- the type of the object contained in this
MarshalledObject
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public final class
MarshalledObject<T>
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
A
MarshalledObject
contains a byte stream with the serialized
 representation of an object given to its constructor.  The
get
method returns a new copy of the original object, as deserialized from
 the contained byte stream.  The contained object is serialized and
 deserialized with the same serialization semantics used for marshaling
 and unmarshaling parameters and return values of RMI calls:  When the
 serialized form is created:
classes are annotated with a codebase URL from where the class
      can be loaded (if available), and
any remote object in the
MarshalledObject
is
      represented by a serialized instance of its stub.
When copy of the object is retrieved (via the
get
method),
 if the class is not available locally, it will be loaded from the
 appropriate location (specified the URL annotated with the class descriptor
 when the class was serialized.
MarshalledObject
facilitates passing objects in RMI calls
 that are not automatically deserialized immediately by the remote peer.

Constructor Details
MarshalledObject
public
MarshalledObject
(
T
obj)
throws
IOException
Creates a new
MarshalledObject
that contains the
 serialized representation of the current state of the supplied object.
 The object is serialized with the semantics used for marshaling
 parameters for RMI calls.
Parameters:
obj
- the object to be serialized (must be serializable)
Throws:
IOException
- if an
IOException
occurs; an
IOException
may occur if
obj
is not
         serializable.
Since:
1.2

IOException
,
ClassNotFoundException
Returns a new copy of the contained marshalledobject.  The internal
 representation is deserialized with the semantics used for
 unmarshaling parameters for RMI calls.
 If the MarshalledObject was read from an ObjectInputStream,
 the filter from that stream is used to deserialize the object.
Returns:
a copy of the contained object
Throws:
IOException
- if an
IOException
occurs while
         deserializing the object from its internal representation.
ClassNotFoundException
- if a
ClassNotFoundException
occurs while deserializing
         the object from its internal representation.
         could not be found
Since:
1.2
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Return a hash code for this
MarshalledObject
.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
a hash code
See Also:
Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Compares this
MarshalledObject
to another object.
 Returns true if and only if the argument refers to a
MarshalledObject
that contains exactly the same
 serialized representation of an object as this one does. The
 comparison ignores any class codebase annotation, meaning that
 two objects are equivalent if they have the same serialized
 representation
except
for the codebase of each class
 in the serialized representation.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- the object to compare with this
MarshalledObject
Returns:
true
if the argument contains an equivalent
 serialized object;
false
otherwise

1.2
