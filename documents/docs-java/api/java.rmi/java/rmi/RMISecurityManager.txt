public class
RMISecurityManager
extends
SecurityManager
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
This class is only useful in conjunction with
the Security Manager
, which is deprecated
       and subject to removal in a future release. Consequently, this class
       is also deprecated and subject to removal. There is no replacement for
       the Security Manager or this class.
RMISecurityManager
implements a policy identical to the policy
 implemented by
SecurityManager
. RMI applications
 should use the
SecurityManager
class or another appropriate
SecurityManager
implementation instead of this class. RMI's class
 loader will download classes from remote locations only if a security
 manager has been set.
Implementation Note:
Applets typically run in a container that already has a security
 manager, so there is generally no need for applets to set a security
 manager. If you have a standalone application, you might need to set a
SecurityManager
in order to enable class downloading. This can be
 done by adding the following to your code. (It needs to be executed before
 RMI can download code from remote hosts, so it most likely needs to appear
 in the
main
method of your application.)
if (System.getSecurityManager() == null) {
        System.setSecurityManager(new SecurityManager());
    }
