Remote
The
Remote
interface serves to identify interfaces whose
 methods may be invoked from a non-local virtual machine.  Any object that
 is a remote object must directly or indirectly implement this interface.
 Only those methods specified in a "remote interface", an interface that
 extends
java.rmi.Remote
are available remotely.
Implementation classes can implement any number of remote interfaces and
 can extend other remote implementation classes.  RMI provides a convenience
 class
UnicastRemoteObject
that remote object implementations can extend and that facilitates remote
 object creation.
For complete details on RMI, see the
RMI Specification
which
 describes the RMI API and system.
