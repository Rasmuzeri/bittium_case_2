@Deprecated
public abstract class
RemoteStub
extends
RemoteObject
Deprecated.
Statically generated stubs are deprecated, since
 stubs are generated dynamically. See
UnicastRemoteObject
for information about dynamic stub generation.
The
RemoteStub
class is the common superclass of
 statically generated client
 stubs and provides the framework to support a wide range of remote
 reference semantics.  Stub objects are surrogates that support
 exactly the same set of remote interfaces defined by the actual
 implementation of the remote object.

Deprecated.
No replacement.  The
setRef
method
 was intended for setting the remote reference of a remote
 stub. This is unnecessary, since
RemoteStub
s can be created
 and initialized with a remote reference through use of
 the
RemoteStub(RemoteRef)
constructor.
