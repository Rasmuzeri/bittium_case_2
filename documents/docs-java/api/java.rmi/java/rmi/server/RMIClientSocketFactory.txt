Interface RMIClientSocketFactory
All Known Implementing Classes:
RMISocketFactory
,
SslRMIClientSocketFactory
public interface
RMIClientSocketFactory
An
RMIClientSocketFactory
instance is used by the RMI runtime
 in order to obtain client sockets for RMI calls.  A remote object can be
 associated with an
RMIClientSocketFactory
when it is
 created/exported via the constructors or
exportObject
methods
 of
java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject
.
An
RMIClientSocketFactory
instance associated with a remote
 object will be downloaded to clients when the remote object's reference is
 transmitted in an RMI call.  This
RMIClientSocketFactory
will
 be used to create connections to the remote object for remote method calls.
An
RMIClientSocketFactory
instance can also be associated
 with a remote object registry so that clients can use custom socket
 communication with a remote object registry.
An implementation of this interface should be serializable and
 should implement
Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
to return
true
when
 passed an instance that represents the same (functionally equivalent)
 client socket factory, and
false
otherwise (and it should also
 implement
Object.hashCode()
consistently with its
Object.equals
implementation).
