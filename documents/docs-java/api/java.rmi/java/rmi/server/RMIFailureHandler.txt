RMIFailureHandler
An
RMIFailureHandler
can be registered via the
RMISocketFactory.setFailureHandler
call. The
failure
method of the handler is invoked when the RMI
 runtime is unable to create a
ServerSocket
to listen
 for incoming calls. The
failure
method returns a boolean
 indicating whether the runtime should attempt to re-create the
ServerSocket
.
Since:
1.1
