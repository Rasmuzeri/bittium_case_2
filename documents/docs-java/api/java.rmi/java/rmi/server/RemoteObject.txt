RemoteObject
extends
Object
implements
Remote
,
Serializable
The
RemoteObject
class implements the
java.lang.Object
behavior for remote objects.
RemoteObject
provides the remote semantics of Object by
 implementing methods for hashCode, equals, and toString.

Method Details
getRef
public
RemoteRef
getRef
()
Returns the remote reference for the remote object.
Note: The object returned from this method may be an instance of
 an implementation-specific class.  The
RemoteObject
class ensures serialization portability of its instances' remote
 references through the behavior of its custom
writeObject
and
readObject
methods.  An
 instance of
RemoteRef
should not be serialized outside
 of its
RemoteObject
wrapper instance or the result may
 be unportable.
Returns:
remote reference for the remote object
Since:
1.2
toStub
public static
Remote
toStub
(
Remote
obj)
throws
NoSuchObjectException
Returns the stub for the remote object
obj
passed
 as a parameter. This operation is only valid
after
the object has been exported.
Parameters:
obj
- the remote object whose stub is needed
Returns:
the stub for the remote object,
obj
.
Throws:
NoSuchObjectException
- if the stub for the
 remote object could not be found.
Since:
1.2
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Returns a hashcode for a remote object.  Two remote object stubs
 that refer to the same remote object will have the same hash code
 (in order to support remote objects as keys in hash tables).
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
a hash code value for this object.
See Also:
Hashtable
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Compares two remote objects for equality.
 Returns a boolean that indicates whether this remote object is
 equivalent to the specified Object. This method is used when a
 remote object is stored in a hashtable.
 If the specified Object is not itself an instance of RemoteObject,
 then this method delegates by returning the result of invoking the
equals
method of its parameter with this remote object
 as the argument.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- the Object to compare with
Returns:
true if these Objects are equal; false otherwise.
See Also:
Hashtable
toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns a String that represents the value of this remote object.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
a string representation of the object.
