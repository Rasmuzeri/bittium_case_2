Interface RMIServerSocketFactory
All Known Implementing Classes:

,
SslRMIServerSocketFactory
public interface
RMIServerSocketFactory
An
RMIServerSocketFactory
instance is used by the RMI runtime
 in order to obtain server sockets for RMI calls.  A remote object can be
 associated with an
RMIServerSocketFactory
when it is
 created/exported via the constructors or
exportObject
methods
 of
java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject
.
An
RMIServerSocketFactory
instance associated with a remote
 object is used to obtain the
ServerSocket
used to accept
 incoming calls from clients.
An
RMIServerSocketFactory
instance can also be associated
 with a remote object registry so that clients can use custom socket
 communication with a remote object registry.
An implementation of this interface
 should implement
Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
to return
true
when
 passed an instance that represents the same (functionally equivalent)
 server socket factory, and
false
otherwise (and it should also
 implement
Object.hashCode()
consistently with its
Object.equals
implementation).
