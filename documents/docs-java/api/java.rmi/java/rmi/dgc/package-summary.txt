java.rmi.dgc
Provides classes and interface for RMI distributed
 garbage-collection (DGC).  When the RMI server returns an object to
 its client (caller of the remote method), it tracks the remote
 object's usage in the client. When there are no more references to the
 remote object on the client, or if the reference's ``lease'' expires and
 not renewed, the server garbage-collects the remote object.
