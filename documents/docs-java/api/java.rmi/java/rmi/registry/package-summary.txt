Package java.rmi.registry
package
java.rmi.registry
Provides a class and two interfaces for the RMI registry.
 A registry is a remote object that maps names to remote objects.  A
 server registers its remote objects with the registry so that they can
 be looked up.  When an object wants to invoke a method on a remote
 object, it must first lookup the remote object using its name.  The
 registry returns to the calling object a reference to the remote
 object, using which a remote method can be invoked.
