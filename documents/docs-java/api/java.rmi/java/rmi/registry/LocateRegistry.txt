Class LocateRegistry
java.lang.Object
java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry
public final class
LocateRegistry
extends
Object
LocateRegistry
is used to obtain a reference to a bootstrap
 remote object registry on a particular host (including the local host), or
 to create a remote object registry that accepts calls on a specific port.
Note that a
getRegistry
call does not actually make a
 connection to the remote host.  It simply creates a local reference to
 the remote registry and will succeed even if no registry is running on
 the remote host.  Therefore, a subsequent method invocation to a remote
 registry returned as a result of this method may fail.
Since:
1.1

Returns a reference to the remote object
Registry
for
 the local host on the default registry port of 1099.
Returns:
reference (a stub) to the remote object registry
Throws:
RemoteException
- if the reference could not be created

Parameters:
port
- port on which the registry accepts requests
Returns:
reference (a stub) to the remote object registry
Throws:
RemoteException
- if the reference could not be created
Since:
1.1
getRegistry
public static
Registry
getRegistry
(
String
host)
throws
RemoteException
Returns a reference to the remote object
Registry
on the
 specified
host
on the default registry port of 1099.  If
host
is
null
, the local host is used.
Parameters:
host
- host for the remote registry
Returns:
reference (a stub) to the remote object registry
Throws:
RemoteException
- if the reference could not be created
Since:
1.1
getRegistry

getRegistry
(
String
host,
 int port)
throws
RemoteException
Returns a reference to the remote object
Registry
on the
 specified
host
and
port
. If
host
is
null
, the local host is used.
Parameters:
host
- host for the remote registry
port
- port on which the registry accepts requests
Returns:
reference (a stub) to the remote object registry
Throws:
RemoteException
- if the reference could not be created

getRegistry
public static
Registry
getRegistry
(
String
host,
 int port,
RMIClientSocketFactory
csf)
throws
RemoteException
Returns a locally created remote reference to the remote object
Registry
on the specified
host
and
port
.  Communication with this remote registry will
 use the supplied
RMIClientSocketFactory
csf
to create
Socket
connections to the registry on the
 remote
host
and
port
.
Parameters:
host
- host for the remote registry
port
- port on which the registry accepts requests
csf
- client-side
Socket
factory used to
      make connections to the registry.  If
csf
is null, then the default client-side
Socket
factory will be used in the registry stub.
Returns:
reference (a stub) to the remote registry
Throws:
RemoteException
- if the reference could not be created
Since:
1.2
createRegistry
public static
Registry
createRegistry
(int port)
throws
RemoteException
Creates and exports a
Registry
instance on the local
 host that accepts requests on the specified
port
.
The
Registry
instance is exported as if the static
UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject
method is invoked, passing the
Registry
instance and the specified
port
as
 arguments, except that the
Registry
instance is
 exported with a well-known object identifier, an
ObjID
instance constructed with the value
ObjID.REGISTRY_ID
.
Parameters:
port
- the port on which the registry accepts requests
Returns:
the registry
Throws:
RemoteException
- if the registry could not be exported
Since:

createRegistry
public static
Registry
createRegistry
(int port,
RMIClientSocketFactory
csf,
RMIServerSocketFactory
ssf)
throws
RemoteException
Creates and exports a
Registry
instance on the local
 host that uses custom socket factories for communication with that
 instance.  The registry that is created listens for incoming
 requests on the given
port
using a
ServerSocket
created from the supplied
RMIServerSocketFactory
.
The
Registry
instance is exported as if
 the static
UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject
method is invoked, passing the
Registry
instance, the specified
port
, the
 specified
RMIClientSocketFactory
, and the specified
RMIServerSocketFactory
as arguments, except that the
Registry
instance is exported with a well-known object
 identifier, an
ObjID
instance constructed with the value
ObjID.REGISTRY_ID
.
Parameters:
port
- port on which the registry accepts requests
csf
- client-side
Socket
factory used to
      make connections to the registry

- server-side
ServerSocket
factory
      used to accept connections to the registry
