Interface Registry
All Superinterfaces:
Remote
public interface
Registry
extends
Remote
Registry
is a remote interface to a simple remote
 object registry that provides methods for storing and retrieving
 remote object references bound with arbitrary string names.  The
bind
,
unbind
, and
rebind
methods are used to alter the name bindings in the registry, and
 the
lookup
and
list
methods are used to
 query the current name bindings.
In its typical usage, a
Registry
enables RMI client
 bootstrapping: it provides a simple means for a client to obtain an
 initial reference to a remote object.  Therefore, a registry's
 remote object implementation is typically exported with a
 well-known address, such as with a well-known
ObjID
and TCP port number
 (default is
1099
).
The
LocateRegistry
class provides a programmatic API for
 constructing a bootstrap reference to a
Registry
at a
 remote address (see the static
getRegistry
methods)
 and for creating and exporting a
Registry
in the
 current VM on a particular local address (see the static
createRegistry
methods).
A
Registry
implementation may choose to restrict
 access to some or all of its methods (for example, methods that
 mutate the registry's bindings may be restricted to calls
 originating from the local host).  If a
Registry
method chooses to deny access for a given invocation, its
 implementation may throw
AccessException
, which
 (because it extends
RemoteException
) will be
 wrapped in a
ServerException
when caught by a
 remote client.
The names used for bindings in a
Registry
are pure
 strings, not parsed.  A service which stores its remote reference
 in a
Registry
may wish to use a package name as a
 prefix in the name binding to reduce the likelihood of name
 collisions in the registry.
