Class Oid
java.lang.Object
org.ietf.jgss.Oid
public class
Oid
extends
Object
This class represents Universal Object Identifiers (Oids) and their
 associated operations.
Oids are hierarchically globally-interpretable identifiers used
 within the GSS-API framework to identify mechanisms and name formats.
The structure and encoding of Oids is defined in ISOIEC-8824 and
 ISOIEC-8825.  For example the Oid representation of Kerberos V5
 mechanism is "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2"
The GSSName name class contains public static Oid objects
 representing the standard name types defined in GSS-API.
Since:
1.4

Oid
(
String
strOid)
throws
GSSException
Constructs an Oid object from a string representation of its
 integer components.
Parameters:
strOid
- the dot separated string representation of the oid.
 For instance, "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2".
Throws:
GSSException
- may be thrown when the string is incorrectly
     formatted
Oid
public
Oid
(
InputStream
derOid)
throws
GSSException
Creates an Oid object from its ASN.1 DER encoding.  This refers to
 the full encoding including tag and length.  The structure and
 encoding of Oids is defined in ISOIEC-8824 and ISOIEC-8825.  This
 method is identical in functionality to its byte array counterpart.
Parameters:
derOid
- stream containing the DER encoded oid
Throws:
GSSException
- may be thrown when the DER encoding does not
  follow the prescribed format.
Oid

Oid
(byte[] data)
throws
GSSException
Creates an Oid object from its ASN.1 DER encoding.  This refers to
 the full encoding including tag and length.  The structure and
 encoding of Oids is defined in ISOIEC-8824 and ISOIEC-8825.  This
 method is identical in functionality to its InputStream counterpart.
Parameters:
data
- byte array containing the DER encoded oid
Throws:
GSSException
- may be thrown when the DER encoding does not
     follow the prescribed format.
Method Details
toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns a string representation of the oid's integer components
 in dot separated notation.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
string representation in the following format: "1.2.3.4.5"
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
other)
Tests if two Oid objects represent the same Object identifier
 value.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
other
- the Oid object that has to be compared to this one
Returns:
true
if the two Oid objects represent the same
 value,
false
otherwise.

 supplied Oid array.
Parameters:
oids
- the array of Oid's to search
Returns:
true if the array contains this Oid value, false otherwise
hashCode
