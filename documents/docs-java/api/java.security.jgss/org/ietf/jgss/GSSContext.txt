Interface GSSContext
All Known Subinterfaces:
ExtendedGSSContext
public interface
GSSContext
This interface encapsulates the GSS-API security context and provides
 the security services that are available over the context.  Security
 contexts are established between peers using locally acquired
 credentials.  Multiple contexts may exist simultaneously between a pair
 of peers, using the same or different set of credentials.  GSS-API
 functions in a manner independent of the underlying transport protocol
 and depends on its calling application to transport the tokens that are
 generated by the security context between the peers.
If the caller instantiates the context using the default
GSSManager
instance, then the Kerberos v5 GSS-API mechanism
 is guaranteed to be available for context establishment. This mechanism
 is identified by the Oid "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2" and is defined in RFC
 1964.
Before the context establishment phase is initiated, the context
 initiator may request specific characteristics desired of the
 established context. Not all underlying mechanisms support all
 characteristics that a caller might desire. After the context is
 established, the caller can check the actual characteristics and services
 offered by that context by means of various query methods. When using
 the Kerberos v5 GSS-API mechanism offered by the default
GSSManager
instance, all optional services will be
 available locally. They are mutual authentication, credential
 delegation, confidentiality and integrity protection, and per-message
 replay detection and sequencing. Note that in the GSS-API, message integrity
 is a prerequisite for message confidentiality.
The context establishment occurs in a loop where the
 initiator calls
initSecContext
and the acceptor calls
acceptSecContext
until the context is established. While in this loop
 the
initSecContext
and
acceptSecContext
methods produce tokens that the application sends over to the peer. The
 peer passes any such token as input to its
acceptSecContext
or
initSecContext
as the case may be.
During the context establishment phase, the
isProtReady
method may be called to determine if the
 context can be used for the per-message operations of
wrap
and
getMIC
.  This allows applications to use
 per-message operations on contexts which aren't yet fully
 established.
After the context has been established or the
isProtReady
method returns
true
, the query routines can be invoked to
 determine the actual characteristics and services of the established
 context.  The application can also start using the per-message methods
 of
wrap
and
getMIC
to obtain
 cryptographic operations on application supplied data.
When the context is no longer needed, the application should call
dispose
to release any system resources the context
 may be using.
A security context typically maintains sequencing and replay detection
 information about the tokens it processes. Therefore, the sequence in
 which any tokens are presented to this context for processing can be
 important. Also note that none of the methods in this interface are
 synchronized. Therefore, it is not advisable to share a
GSSContext
among several threads unless some application
 level synchronization is in place.
Finally, different mechanism providers might place different security
 restrictions on using GSS-API contexts. These will be documented by the
 mechanism provider. The application will need to ensure that it has the
 appropriate permissions if such checks are made in the mechanism layer.
The stream-based methods of
GSSContext
have been deprecated in
 Java SE 11. These methods have also been removed from
RFC 8353: Generic Security Service API Version 2: Java Bindings Update
for the following reasons (see section 11): "The overloaded methods of
 GSSContext that use input and output streams as the means to convey
 authentication and per-message GSS-API tokens as described in Section 5.15
 of RFC 5653 are removed in this update as the wire protocol
 should be defined by an application and not a library. It's also impossible
 to implement these methods correctly when the token has no self-framing
 (where the end cannot be determined), or the library has no knowledge of
 the token format (for example, as a bridge talking to another GSS library)".
 These methods include
initSecContext(InputStream, OutputStream)
,
acceptSecContext(InputStream, OutputStream)
,
wrap(InputStream, OutputStream, MessageProp)
,
unwrap(InputStream, OutputStream, MessageProp)
,
getMIC(InputStream, OutputStream, MessageProp)
,
 and
verifyMIC(InputStream, InputStream, MessageProp)
.
The example code presented below demonstrates the usage of the
GSSContext
interface for the initiating peer.  Different
 operations on the
GSSContext
object are presented,
 including: object instantiation, setting of desired flags, context
 establishment, query of actual context flags, per-message operations on
 application data, and finally context deletion.

    // and the implementation specific default mechanism

    while (!context.isEstablished()) {

        outToken = context.initSecContext(inToken, 0, inToken.length);

GSSException
Called by the context initiator to start the context creation
 phase and process any tokens generated
 by the peer's
acceptSecContext
method.
 This method may return an output token which the application will need
 to send to the peer for processing by its
acceptSecContext
method. The application can call
isEstablished
to determine if the context establishment phase is
 complete on this side of the context.  A return value of
false
from
isEstablished
indicates that
 more tokens are expected to be supplied to
initSecContext
.  Upon completion of the context
 establishment, the available context options may be queried through
 the get methods.
Note that it is possible that the
initSecContext
method
 return a token for the peer, and
isEstablished
return
true
also. This indicates that the token needs to be sent
 to the peer, but the local end of the context is now fully
 established.
Some mechanism providers might require that the caller be granted
 permission to initiate a security context. A failed permission check
 might cause a
SecurityException
to be thrown from this method.
Parameters:
inputBuf
- token generated by the peer. This parameter is ignored
 on the first call since no token has been received from the peer.
offset
- the offset within the inputBuf where the token begins.
len
- the length of the token.
Returns:
a byte[] containing the token to be sent to the
 peer.
null
indicates that no token is generated.
Throws:
GSSException
- containing the following
 major error codes:
GSSException.DEFECTIVE_TOKEN

initSecContext(byte[], int, int)
instead.
Called by the context initiator to start the context creation
 phase and process any tokens generated
 by the peer's
acceptSecContext
method using
 streams. This method may write an output token to the
OutpuStream
, which the application will
 need to send to the peer for processing by its
acceptSecContext
call. Typically, the application would
 ensure this by calling the
flush
method on an
OutputStream
that encapsulates the
 connection between the two peers. The application can
 determine if a token is written to the OutputStream from the return
 value of this method. A return value of
0
indicates that
 no token was written. The application can call
isEstablished
to determine if the context
 establishment phase is complete on this side of the context. A
 return  value of
false
from
isEstablished
indicates that more tokens are expected to be supplied to
initSecContext
.
 Upon completion of the context establishment, the available context
 options may be queried through the get methods.
Note that it is possible that the
initSecContext
method
 return a token for the peer, and
isEstablished
return
true
also. This indicates that the token needs to be sent
 to the peer, but the local end of the context is now fully
 established.
The GSS-API authentication tokens contain a definitive start and
 end. This method will attempt to read one of these tokens per
 invocation, and may block on the stream if only part of the token is
 available.  In all other respects this method is equivalent to the
 byte array based
initSecContext
.
Some mechanism providers might require that the caller be granted
 permission to initiate a security context. A failed permission check
 might cause a
SecurityException
to be thrown from this method.
The following example code demonstrates how this method might be
 used:
InputStream is ...
     OutputStream os ...
     GSSContext context ...

     // Loop while there is still a token to be processed

     while (!context.isEstablished()) {

         context.initSecContext(is, os);

         // send output token if generated
         os.flush();
     }
Parameters:
inStream
- an InputStream that contains the token generated by
 the peer. This parameter is ignored on the first call since no token
 has been or will be received from the peer at that point.
outStream
- an OutputStream where the output token will be
 written. During the final stage of context establishment, there may be
 no bytes written.
Returns:
the number of bytes written to the OutputStream as part of the
 token to be sent to the peer. A value of 0 indicates that no token
 needs to be sent.
Throws:

GSS-API implementations are recommended but not required to detect
 invalid QOP values when
getWrapSizeLimit
is called.
 This routine guarantees only a maximum message size, not the
 availability of specific QOP values for message protection.
Parameters:
qop
- the level of protection wrap will be asked to provide.
confReq
-
true
if wrap will be asked to provide
 privacy,
false
otherwise.
maxTokenSize
- the desired maximum size of the token emitted by
 wrap.
Returns:
the maximum size of the input token for the given output
 token size

throws
GSSException
Applies per-message security services over the established security
 context. The method will return a token with the
 application supplied data and a cryptographic MIC over it.
 The data may be encrypted if confidentiality (privacy) was
 requested.
The MessageProp object is instantiated by the application and used
 to specify a QOP value which selects cryptographic algorithms, and a
 privacy service to optionally encrypt the message.  The underlying
 mechanism that is used in the call may not be able to provide the
 privacy service.  It sets the actual privacy service that it does
 provide in this MessageProp object which the caller should then
 query upon return.  If the mechanism is not able to provide the
 requested QOP, it throws a GSSException with the BAD_QOP code.
Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens
 emitted by wrap to provide "secure framing", implementations should
 support the wrapping of zero-length messages.
The application will be responsible for sending the token to the
 peer.
Parameters:
inBuf
- application data to be protected.
offset
- the offset within the inBuf where the data begins.
len
- the length of the data
msgProp
- instance of MessageProp that is used by the
 application to set the desired QOP and privacy state. Set the
 desired QOP to 0 to request the default QOP. Upon return from this
 method, this object will contain the actual privacy state that
 was applied to the message by the underlying mechanism.
Returns:

export
()
       throws
GSSException
Exports this context so that another process may
 import it. Provided to support the sharing of work between
 multiple processes. This routine will typically be used by the
 context-acceptor, in an application where a single process receives
 incoming connection requests and accepts security contexts over
 them, then passes the established context to one or more other
 processes for message exchange.
This method deactivates the security context and creates an
 interprocess token which, when passed to
GSSManager.createContext
in
 another process, will re-activate the context in the second process.
 Only a single instantiation of a given context may be active at any
 one time; a subsequent attempt by a context exporter to access the
 exported security context will fail.
The implementation may constrain the set of processes by which the
 interprocess token may be imported, either as a function of local
 security policy, or as a result of implementation decisions.  For
 example, some implementations may constrain contexts to be passed
 only between processes that run under the same account, or which are
 part of the same process group.
The interprocess token may contain security-sensitive information
 (for example cryptographic keys).  While mechanisms are encouraged
 to either avoid placing such sensitive information within
 interprocess tokens, or to encrypt the token before returning it to
 the application, in a typical GSS-API implementation this may not be
 possible.  Thus, the application must take care to protect the
 interprocess token, and ensure that any process to which the token
 is transferred is trustworthy.
Implementations are not required to support the inter-process
 transfer of security contexts.  Calling the
isTransferable
method will indicate if the context object is
 transferable.
Calling this method on a context that
 is not exportable will result in this exception being thrown with
 the error code
GSSException.UNAVAILABLE

 detection is not an option and is a function of the underlying
 mechanism's capabilities.
Not all mechanisms support replay detection and some mechanisms
 might require replay detection even if the application

Requests that the initiator's credentials be
 delegated to the acceptor during context establishment. This
 request can only be made on the context initiator's side, and it has
 to be done prior to the first call to

 Not all mechanisms support credential delegation. Therefore, an
 application that desires delegation should check to see if the
 request was honored with the
getCredDelegState
method. If the application indicates that
 delegation must not be used, then the mechanism will honor the
 request and delegation will not occur. This is an exception
 to the general rule that a mechanism may enable a service even if it
 is not requested.
Parameters:
state

 Not all mechanisms support confidentiality and other mechanisms
 might enable it even if the application doesn't request
 it. The application may check to see if the request was honored with
 the
getConfState
method. If confidentiality
 is enabled, only then will the mechanism honor a request for privacy
 in the
MessageProp
object that is passed in to the
wrap
method.
Enabling confidentiality will also automatically enable
 integrity.
Parameters:

The actual lifetime of the context will depend on the capabilities of
 the underlying mechanism and the application should call the
getLifetime
method to determine this.
Parameters:

getAnonymityState
boolean
getAnonymityState
()
Determines if the context initiator is
 anonymously authenticated to the context acceptor. It can be called by
 both the context initiator and the context acceptor, and at any
 time.
On the initiator side, a call to this method determines
 if the identity of the initiator has been disclosed in any of the
 context establishment tokens that might have been generated thus far
 by
initSecContext
. An initiator that absolutely must be
 authenticated anonymously should call this method after each call to
initSecContext
to determine if the generated token
 should be sent to the peer or the context aborted.
On the
 acceptor side, a call to this method determines if any of the tokens
 processed by
acceptSecContext
thus far have divulged
 the identity of the initiator.
Returns:
true if the context initiator is still anonymous, false
 otherwise.

 major error codes:
GSSException.FAILURE
isProtReady
boolean
isProtReady
()
Determines if the context is ready for per message operations to be
 used over it.  Some mechanisms may allow the usage of the
 per-message operations before the context is fully established.
Returns:
true if methods like
wrap
,
unwrap
,
getMIC
, and
verifyMIC
can be used with
 this context at the current stage of context establishment, false
 otherwise.
getConfState
boolean
getConfState
()
Determines if data confidentiality is available
 over the context. This method can be called by both the context
 initiator and the context acceptor, but only after one of
isProtReady
or
isEstablished
return
true
. If this method returns
true
, so will
getIntegState
Returns:
true if confidentiality services are available, false
 otherwise.

()
Determines if data integrity is available
 over the context. This method can be called by both the context
 initiator and the context acceptor, but only after one of
isProtReady
or
isEstablished
return
true
. This method will always
 return
true
if
getConfState
returns true.
Returns:
true if integrity services are available, false otherwise.

getLifetime
int
getLifetime
()
Determines what the remaining lifetime for this
 context is. It can be called by both the context initiator and the
 context acceptor, but for a definitive answer it should be called
 only after
isEstablished
returns
 true.
Returns:
the remaining lifetime in seconds

 established. The caller can use the method
getCredDelegState
to determine if there are
 any delegated credentials.
Returns:
a GSSCredential containing the initiator's delegated
 credentials, or
null
is no credentials
 were delegated.
Throws:
