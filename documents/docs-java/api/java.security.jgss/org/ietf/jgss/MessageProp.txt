Class MessageProp
java.lang.Object
org.ietf.jgss.MessageProp
public class
MessageProp
extends
Object
This is a utility class used within the per-message GSSContext
 methods to convey per-message properties.
When used with the GSSContext interface's wrap and getMIC methods, an
 instance of this class is used to indicate the desired
 Quality-of-Protection (QOP) and to request if confidentiality services
 are to be applied to caller supplied data (wrap only).  To request
 default QOP, the value of 0 should be used for QOP.
When used with the unwrap and verifyMIC methods of the GSSContext
 interface, an instance of this class will be used to indicate the
 applied QOP and confidentiality services over the supplied message.
 In the case of verifyMIC, the confidentiality state will always be
false
.  Upon return from these methods, this object will also
 contain any supplementary status values applicable to the processed
 token.  The supplementary status values can indicate old tokens, out
 of sequence tokens, gap tokens or duplicate tokens.
Since:
1.4

Constructor Details
MessageProp
public
MessageProp
(boolean privState)
Constructor which sets the desired privacy state. The QOP value used
 is 0.
Parameters:
privState
- the privacy (i.e. confidentiality) state
MessageProp
public
MessageProp
(int qop,
 boolean privState)
Constructor which sets the values for the qop and privacy state.
Parameters:
qop
- the QOP value
privState
- the privacy (i.e. confidentiality) state
Method Details
getQOP
public
int
getQOP
()
Retrieves the QOP value.
Returns:
an int representing the QOP value
See Also:
setQOP(int)
getPrivacy
public
boolean
getPrivacy
()
Retrieves the privacy state.
Returns:
true if the privacy (i.e., confidentiality) state is true,
 false otherwise.
See Also:
setPrivacy(boolean)
setQOP
public
void
setQOP
(int qop)
Sets the QOP value.
Parameters:
qop
- the int value to set the QOP to
See Also:
getQOP()
setPrivacy
public
void
setPrivacy
(boolean privState)
Sets the privacy state.
Parameters:
privState
- true is the privacy (i.e., confidentiality) state
 is true, false otherwise.
See Also:
getPrivacy()
isDuplicateToken
public
boolean
isDuplicateToken
()
Tests if this is a duplicate of an earlier token.
Returns:
true if this is a duplicate, false otherwise.
isOldToken
public
boolean
isOldToken
()
Tests if this token's validity period has expired, i.e., the token
 is too old to be checked for duplication.
Returns:
true if the token's validity period has expired, false
 otherwise.
isUnseqToken
public
boolean
isUnseqToken
()
Tests if a later token had already been processed.
Returns:
true if a later token had already been processed, false otherwise.
isGapToken
public
boolean
isGapToken
()
Tests if an expected token was not received, i.e., one or more
 predecessor tokens have not yet been successfully processed.
Returns:
true if an expected per-message token was not received,
 false otherwise.
getMinorStatus
public
int
getMinorStatus
()
Retrieves the minor status code that the underlying mechanism might
 have set for this per-message operation.
Returns:
the int minor status
getMinorString
public
String
getMinorString
()
Retrieves a string explaining the minor status code.
Returns:
a String corresponding to the minor status
 code.
null
will be returned when no minor status code
 has been set.
setSupplementaryStates
public
void
setSupplementaryStates
(boolean duplicate,
 boolean old,
 boolean unseq,
 boolean gap,
 int minorStatus,
String
minorString)
This method sets the state for the supplementary information flags
 and the minor status in MessageProp.  It is not used by the
 application but by the GSS implementation to return this information
 to the caller of a per-message context method.
Parameters:
duplicate
- true if the token was a duplicate of an earlier
 token, false otherwise
old
- true if the token's validity period has expired, false
 otherwise
unseq
- true if a later token has already been processed, false
 otherwise
gap
- true if one or more predecessor tokens have not yet been
 successfully processed, false otherwise
minorStatus
- the int minor status code for the per-message
 operation
minorString
- the textual representation of the minorStatus value
