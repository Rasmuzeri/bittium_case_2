Class GSSManager
java.lang.Object
org.ietf.jgss.GSSManager
public abstract class
GSSManager
extends
Object
This class serves as a factory for other important
 GSS-API classes and also provides information about the mechanisms that
 are supported. It can create instances of classes
 implementing the following three GSS-API interfaces:
GSSName
,
GSSCredential
, and
GSSContext
. It also has methods to query for the list
 of available mechanisms and the nametypes that each mechanism
 supports.
An instance of the default
GSSManager
subclass
 may be obtained through the static method
getInstance
, but applications are free to instantiate other subclasses
 of
GSSManager
. The default
GSSManager
instance
 will support the Kerberos v5 GSS-API mechanism in addition to any
 others. This mechanism is identified by the Oid "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2"
 and is defined in RFC 1964.
A subclass extending the
GSSManager
abstract class may be
 implemented  as a modular provider based layer that utilizes some well
 known  service provider specification. The
GSSManager
API
 allows the application to set provider preferences on
 such an implementation. These methods also allow the implementation to
 throw a well-defined exception in case provider based configuration is
 not supported. Applications that expect to be portable should be aware
 of this and recover cleanly by catching the exception.
It is envisioned that there will be three most common ways in which
 providers will be used:
The application does not care about what provider is used (the
 default case).
The application wants a particular provider to be used
 preferentially, either for a particular mechanism or all the
 time, irrespective of mechanism.
The application wants to use the locally configured providers
 as far as possible but if support is missing for one or more
 mechanisms then it wants to fall back on its own provider.
The
GSSManager
class has two methods that enable these modes of
 usage:
addProviderAtFront
and
addProviderAtEnd
. These methods
 have the effect of creating an ordered list of
<provider,
 oid>
pairs  where each pair indicates a preference of provider
 for a given oid.
It is important to note that there are certain interactions
 between the different GSS-API objects that are created by a
 GSSManager, where the provider that is used for a particular mechanism
 might need to be consistent across all objects. For instance, if a
 GSSCredential contains elements from a provider
p
for a mechanism
m
, it should generally be passed in to a GSSContext that will use
 provider
p
for the mechanism
m
. A simple rule of thumb
 that will maximize portability is that objects created from different
 GSSManager's should not be mixed, and if possible, a different
 GSSManager instance should be created if the application wants to invoke
 the
addProviderAtFront
method on a GSSManager that has
 already created an object.
Here is some sample code showing how the GSSManager might be used:
GSSManager manager = GSSManager.getInstance();

     Oid krb5Mechanism = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2");
     Oid krb5PrincipalNameType = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2.1");

     // Identify who the client wishes to be
     GSSName userName = manager.createName("duke", GSSName.NT_USER_NAME);

     // Identify the name of the server. This uses a Kerberos specific
     // name format.
     GSSName serverName = manager.createName("nfs/foo.sun.com",
                                             krb5PrincipalNameType);

     // Acquire credentials for the user
     GSSCredential userCreds = manager.createCredential(userName,
                                             GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME,
                                             krb5Mechanism,
                                             GSSCredential.INITIATE_ONLY);

     // Instantiate and initialize a security context that will be
     // established with the server
     GSSContext context = manager.createContext(serverName,
                                                krb5Mechanism,
                                                userCreds,
                                                GSSContext.DEFAULT_LIFETIME);
The server side might use the following variation of this source:
// Acquire credentials for the server
     GSSCredential serverCreds = manager.createCredential(serverName,
                                             GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME,
                                             krb5Mechanism,
                                             GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY);

     // Instantiate and initialize a security context that will
     // wait for an establishment request token from the client
     GSSContext context = manager.createContext(serverCreds);

GSSException
Factory method to convert a string name from the
 specified namespace to a GSSName object. In general, the
GSSName
object created  will contain multiple
 representations of the name, one for each mechanism that is
 supported; two examples that are exceptions to this are when
 the namespace type parameter indicates NT_EXPORT_NAME or when the
 GSS-API implementation is not multi-mechanism. It is
 not recommended to use this method with a NT_EXPORT_NAME type because
 representing a previously exported name consisting of arbitrary bytes
 as a String might cause problems with character encoding schemes. In
 such cases it is recommended that the bytes be passed in directly to
 the overloaded form of this method
createName
.
Parameters:
nameStr
- the string representing a printable form of the name to
 create.
nameType
- the Oid specifying the namespace of the printable name
 supplied.
null
can be used to specify
 that a mechanism specific default printable syntax should
 be assumed by each mechanism that examines nameStr.
 It is not advisable to use the nametype NT_EXPORT_NAME with this
 method.
Returns:
a GSSName representing the indicated principal

(int usage)
throws
GSSException
Factory method for acquiring default credentials.  This will cause
 the GSS-API to use system specific defaults for the set of mechanisms,
 name, and lifetime.
GSS-API mechanism providers must impose a local access-control
 policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring
 credentials to which they are not entitled. The kinds of permissions
 needed by different mechanism providers will be documented on a
 per-mechanism basis. A failed permission check might cause a
SecurityException
to be thrown from
 this method.
Parameters:
usage
- The intended usage for this credential object. The value
 of this parameter must be one of:
GSSCredential.INITIATE_AND_ACCEPT
,
GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY
, and
GSSCredential.INITIATE_ONLY
.
Returns:
a GSSCredential of the requested type.

SecurityException
to be thrown from
 this method.
Non-default values for lifetime cannot always be honored by the
 underlying mechanisms, thus applications should be prepared to call
getRemainingLifetime
on the returned credential.

GSSException
This method is used to indicate to the GSSManager that the
 application would like a particular provider to be used ahead of all
 others when support is desired for the given mechanism. When a value
 of null is used instead of an
Oid
for the mechanism,
 the GSSManager must use the indicated provider ahead of all others
 no matter what the mechanism is. Only when the indicated provider
 does not support the needed mechanism should the GSSManager move on
 to a different provider.
Calling this method repeatedly preserves the older settings but
 lowers them in preference thus forming an ordered list of provider
 and
Oid
pairs that grows at the top.
Calling addProviderAtFront with a null
Oid
will remove
 all previous preferences that were set for this provider in the
 GSSManager instance. Calling addProviderAtFront with a non-null
Oid
will remove any previous preference that was set
 using this mechanism and this provider together.
If the GSSManager implementation does not support an SPI with a
 pluggable provider architecture it should throw a GSSException with
 the status code GSSException.UNAVAILABLE to indicate that the
 operation is unavailable.
Suppose an application desired that the provider A always be checked
 first when any mechanism is needed, it would call:
GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();
         // mgr may at this point have its own pre-configured list
         // of provider preferences. The following will prepend to
         // any such list:

         mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, null);
Now if it also desired that the mechanism of Oid m1 always be
 obtained from the provider B before the previously set A was checked,
 it would call:
mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, m1);
The GSSManager would then first check with B if m1 was needed. In
 case B did not provide support for m1, the GSSManager would continue
 on to check with A.  If any mechanism m2 is needed where m2 is
 different from m1 then the GSSManager would skip B and check with A
 directly.
Suppose at a later time the following call is made to the same
 GSSManager instance:
mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, null)
then the previous setting with the pair (B, m1) is subsumed by this
 and should be removed. Effectively the list of preferences now
 becomes {(B, null), (A, null),
         ... //followed by the pre-configured list.
Please note, however, that the following call:
mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, m3)
does not subsume the previous setting of (A, null) and the list will
 effectively become {(A, m3), (B, null), (A, null), ...}
Parameters:
p
- the provider instance that should be used whenever support
 is needed for mech.
mech
- the mechanism for which the provider is being set
Throws:

GSSException
This method is used to indicate to the GSSManager that the
 application would like a particular provider to be used if no other
 provider can be found that supports the given mechanism. When a value
 of null is used instead of an Oid for the mechanism, the GSSManager
 must use the indicated provider for any mechanism.
Calling this method repeatedly preserves the older settings but
 raises them above newer ones in preference thus forming an ordered
 list of providers and Oid pairs that grows at the bottom. Thus, the
 older provider settings will be utilized first before this one is.
If there are any previously existing preferences that conflict with
 the preference being set here, then the GSSManager should ignore this
 request.
If the GSSManager implementation does not support an SPI with a
 pluggable provider architecture it should throw a GSSException with
 the status code GSSException.UNAVAILABLE to indicate that the
 operation is unavailable.
Suppose an application desired that when a mechanism of Oid m1 is
 needed the system default providers always be checked first, and only
 when they do not support m1 should a provider A be checked. It would
 then make the call:
GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();
         mgr.addProviderAtEnd(A, m1);
Now, if it also desired that for all mechanisms the provider B be
 checked after all configured providers have been checked, it would
 then call:
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(B, null);
Effectively the list of preferences now becomes {..., (A, m1), (B,
 null)}.
Suppose at a later time the following call is made to the same
 GSSManager instance:
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(B, m2)
then the previous setting with the pair (B, null) subsumes this and
 therefore this request should be ignored. The same would happen if a
 request is made for the already existing pairs of (A, m1) or (B,
 null).
Please note, however, that the following call:
mgr.addProviderAtEnd(A, null)
is not subsumed by the previous setting of (A, m1) and the list will
 effectively become {..., (A, m1), (B, null), (A, null)}
Parameters:
p
- the provider instance that should be used whenever support
 is needed for mech.
mech
- the mechanism for which the provider is being set
Throws:
GSSException

 major error codes:
