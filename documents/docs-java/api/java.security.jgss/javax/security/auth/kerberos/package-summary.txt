Package javax.security.auth.kerberos
package
javax.security.auth.kerberos
This package contains utility classes related to the Kerberos network
 authentication protocol. They do not provide much Kerberos support
 themselves.
The Kerberos network authentication protocol is defined in
RFC 4120
. The Java
 platform contains support for the client side of Kerberos via the
org.ietf.jgss
package. There might also be
 a login module that implements
LoginModule
to authenticate
 Kerberos principals.
You can provide the name of your default realm and Key Distribution
 Center (KDC) host for that realm using the system properties
java.security.krb5.realm
and
java.security.krb5.kdc
. Both properties must be set.
 Alternatively, the
java.security.krb5.conf
system property
 can be set to the location of an MIT style
krb5.conf
configuration
 file. If none of these system properties are set, the
krb5.conf
file is searched for in an implementation-specific manner. Typically,
 an implementation will first look for a
krb5.conf
file in
<java-home>/conf/security
and failing that, in an OS-specific
 location.
The
krb5.conf
file is formatted in the Windows INI file style,
 which contains a series of relations grouped into different sections.
 Each relation contains a key and a value, the value can be an arbitrary
 string or a boolean value. A boolean value can be one of "true", "false",
 "yes", or "no", and values are case-insensitive.
