Module jdk.jshell
module
jdk.jshell
Provides the
jshell
tool for evaluating
 snippets of Java code, and defines a JDK-specific API for modeling and
 executing snippets.
 The JShell API supports Java Programming Language 'snippet' evaluating
 tools, such as Read-Eval-Print Loops (REPLs).
 Separate packages support building tools, configuring the execution of tools,
 and programmatically launching the existing Java shell tool.
The
jdk.jshell
is the package for creating 'snippet' evaluating tools.
     Generally, this is only package that would be needed for creating tools.
The
jdk.jshell.spi
package specifies a Service Provider Interface (SPI)
     for defining execution engine implementations for tools based on the
jdk.jshell
API. The
jdk.jshell.execution
package provides
     standard implementations of
jdk.jshell.spi
interfaces and supporting code.  It
     also serves as a library of functionality for defining new execution engine
     implementations.
The
jdk.jshell.tool
package supports programmatically launching the
jshell
tool.
The
jdk.jshell.execution
package contains implementations of the
     interfaces in
jdk.jshell.spi
.  Otherwise, the four packages are
     independent, operate at different levels, and do not share functionality or
     definitions.
