Interface SourceCodeAnalysis.SnippetWrapper
Enclosing class:
SourceCodeAnalysis
public static interface
SourceCodeAnalysis.SnippetWrapper
The wrapping of a snippet of Java source into valid top-level Java
 source. The wrapping will always either be an import or include a
 synthetic class at the top-level. If a synthetic class is generated, it
 will be proceeded by the package and import declarations, and may contain
 synthetic class members.
This interface, in addition to the mapped form, provides the context and
 position mapping information.

Method Details
source
String
source
()
Returns the input that is wrapped. For
wrappers(String)
,
 this is the source of the snippet within the input. A variable
 declaration of
N
variables will map to
N
wrappers
 with the source separated.
For
wrapper(Snippet)
,
 this is
Snippet.source()
.
Returns:
the input source corresponding to the wrapper.
wrapped
String
wrapped
()
Returns a Java class definition that wraps the
source()
or, if an import, the import source.
If the input is not a valid Snippet, this will not be a valid
 class/import definition.
The source may be divided and mapped to different locations within
 the wrapped source.
Returns:
the source wrapped into top-level Java code
fullClassName
String
fullClassName
()
Returns the fully qualified class name of the
wrapped()
class.
 For erroneous input, a best guess is returned.
Returns:
the name of the synthetic wrapped class; if an import, the
 name is not defined
kind
Snippet.Kind
kind
()
Returns the
Snippet.Kind
of the
source()
.
Returns:
an enum representing the general kind of snippet.
sourceToWrappedPosition
int
sourceToWrappedPosition
(int pos)
Maps character position within the source to character position
 within the wrapped.
Parameters:
pos
- the position in
source()
Returns:
the corresponding position in
wrapped()
wrappedToSourcePosition
int
wrappedToSourcePosition
(int pos)
Maps character position within the wrapped to character position
 within the source.
Parameters:
pos
- the position in
wrapped()
Returns:
the corresponding position in
source()
