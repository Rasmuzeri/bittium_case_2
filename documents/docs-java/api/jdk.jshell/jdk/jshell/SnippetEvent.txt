Class SnippetEvent
java.lang.Object
jdk.jshell.SnippetEvent
public class
SnippetEvent
extends
Object
A description of a change to a Snippet. These are generated by direct changes
 to state with
JShell.eval(String)
or
JShell.drop(Snippet)
,
 or indirectly by these same methods as
 dependencies change or Snippets are overwritten. For direct changes, the
causeSnippet()
is
null
.
SnippetEvent
is immutable: an access to
 any of its methods will always return the same result.
 and thus is thread-safe.
