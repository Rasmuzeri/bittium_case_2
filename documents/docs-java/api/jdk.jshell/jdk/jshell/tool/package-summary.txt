jdk.jshell.tool
Provides a mechanism to launch an instance of a Java shell tool.
 Allows configuration of the tool before launching. A builder is used
 to configure and launch the tool.
At the simplest, a builder is retrieved, and the builder is used to start the
 tool:
JavaShellToolBuilder
             .builder()
             .start();
The builder can be configured and the start can have arguments:
JavaShellToolBuilder
             .builder()
             .out(myCommandPrintStream, myOutputPrintStream)
             .locale(Locale.CANADA)
             .start("--feedback", "silent", "MyStart");
