 is either just a variable identifier or it is an assignment
 to a variable, there is always a variable which is the subject of the
 expression. All other forms of expression become temporary variables
 which are instead referenced by a
VarSnippet
.
Returns:
the name of the variable which is the subject of the expression.

String
typeName
()
Type of the expression

String representation of the type of the expression.
