public abstract class
Snippet
extends
Object
A Snippet represents a snippet of Java source code as passed to
JShell.eval(java.lang.String)
.  It is associated only with the
JShell
instance that created it.
 An instance of Snippet (including its subclasses) is immutable: an access to
 any of its methods will always return the same result.
 For information about the current state of the snippet within the JShell
 state engine, query
JShell
passing the Snippet.
Because it is immutable,
Snippet
(and subclasses) is thread-safe.
