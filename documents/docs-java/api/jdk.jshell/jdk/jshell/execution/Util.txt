Method Details
forwardExecutionControl
public static
void
forwardExecutionControl
(
ExecutionControl
ec,
ObjectInput
in,
ObjectOutput
out)
Forward commands from the input to the specified
ExecutionControl
instance, then responses back on the output.
Parameters:
ec
- the direct instance of
ExecutionControl
to process commands
in
- the command input
out
- the command response output

throws
IOException
Forward commands from the input to the specified
ExecutionControl
instance, then responses back on the output.
Parameters:
ec
- the direct instance of
ExecutionControl
to process commands
inStream
- the stream from which to create the command input
outStream
- the stream that will carry any specified auxiliary channels (like
System.out
and
System.err
), and the command response output.
outputStreamMap
- a map between names of additional streams to carry and setters
                        for the stream. Names starting with '$' are reserved for internal use.
inputStreamMap
- a map between names of additional streams to carry and setters
                       for the stream. Names starting with '$' are reserved for internal use.
Throws:
IOException
- if there are errors using the passed streams

throws
IOException
Creates an ExecutionControl for given packetized input and output. The given InputStream
 is de-packetized, and content forwarded to ObjectInput and given OutputStreams. The ObjectOutput
 and values read from the given InputStream are packetized and sent to the given OutputStream.
Parameters:
input
- the packetized input stream
output
- the packetized output stream
outputStreamMap
- a map between stream names and the output streams to forward.
                        Names starting with '$' are reserved for internal use.
inputStreamMap
- a map between stream names and the input streams to forward.
                       Names starting with '$' are reserved for internal use.
factory
- to create the ExecutionControl from ObjectInput and ObjectOutput.
Returns:
the created ExecutionControl
Throws:
IOException
- if setting up the streams raised an exception
detectJdiExitEvent
public static
void
detectJdiExitEvent
(
VirtualMachine
vm,
Consumer
<
String
> unbiddenExitHandler)
Monitor the JDI event stream for
VMDeathEvent
and
VMDisconnectEvent
. If encountered, invokes
unbiddenExitHandler
.
Parameters:
vm
- the virtual machine to check
unbiddenExitHandler
- the handler, which will accept the exit
 information
