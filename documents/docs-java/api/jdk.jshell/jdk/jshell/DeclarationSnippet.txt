Grouping for all declaration Snippets: variable declarations
 (
VarSnippet
), method declarations
 (
MethodSnippet
), and type declarations
 (
TypeDeclSnippet
).
Declaration snippets are unique in that they can be active
  with unresolved references:
RECOVERABLE_DEFINED
or
RECOVERABLE_NOT_DEFINED
.
 Unresolved references can be queried with
JShell.unresolvedDependencies(DeclarationSnippet)
.
DeclarationSnippet
is immutable: an access to
 any of its methods will always return the same result.
 and thus is thread-safe.
