Class ServerSocketFactory
java.lang.Object
javax.net.ServerSocketFactory
Direct Known Subclasses:
SSLServerSocketFactory
public abstract class
ServerSocketFactory
extends
Object
This class creates server sockets.  It may be subclassed by other
 factories, which create particular types of server sockets.  This
 provides a general framework for the addition of public socket-level
 functionality.  It is the server side analogue of a socket factory,
 and similarly provides a way to capture a variety of policies related
 to the sockets being constructed.
Like socket factories, server Socket factory instances have
 methods used to create sockets. There is also an environment
 specific default server socket factory; frameworks will often use
 their own customized factory.

ServerSocket
createServerSocket
()
                                throws
IOException
Returns an unbound server socket.  The socket is configured with
 the socket options (such as accept timeout) given to this factory.
Returns:
the unbound socket
Throws:
IOException
- if the socket cannot be created

public abstract
ServerSocket
createServerSocket
(int port)
throws
IOException
Returns a server socket bound to the specified port.
 The socket is configured with the socket options
 (such as accept timeout) given to this factory.
If there is a security manager, its
checkListen
method is called with the
port
argument as its
 argument to ensure the operation is allowed. This could result
 in a SecurityException.
Parameters:
port
- the port to listen to
Returns:
the
ServerSocket
Throws:
IOException
- for networking errors
SecurityException
- if a security manager exists and its
checkListen
method doesn't allow the operation.
IllegalArgumentException
- if the port parameter is outside the
         specified range of valid port values, which is between 0 and
         65535, inclusive.

createServerSocket
public abstract
ServerSocket
createServerSocket
(int port,
 int backlog)
throws
IOException
Returns a server socket bound to the specified port, and uses the
 specified connection backlog.  The socket is configured with
 the socket options (such as accept timeout) given to this factory.
The
backlog
argument must be a positive
 value greater than 0. If the value passed if equal or less
 than 0, then the default value will be assumed.
If there is a security manager, its
checkListen
method is called with the
port
argument as its
 argument to ensure the operation is allowed. This could result
 in a SecurityException.
Parameters:
port
- the port to listen to
backlog
- how many connections are queued
Returns:
the
ServerSocket
Throws:
IOException
- for networking errors
SecurityException
- if a security manager exists and its
checkListen
method doesn't allow the operation.
IllegalArgumentException
- if the port parameter is outside the
         specified range of valid port values, which is between 0 and
         65535, inclusive.

ServerSocket(int, int)
createServerSocket
public abstract
ServerSocket
createServerSocket
(int port,
 int backlog,
InetAddress
ifAddress)
throws
IOException
Returns a server socket bound to the specified port,
 with a specified listen backlog and local IP.
The
ifAddress
argument can be used on a multi-homed
 host for a
ServerSocket
that will only accept connect
 requests to one of its addresses. If
ifAddress
is null,
 it will accept connections on all local addresses. The socket is
 configured with the socket options (such as accept timeout) given
 to this factory.
The
backlog
argument must be a positive
 value greater than 0. If the value passed if equal or less
 than 0, then the default value will be assumed.
If there is a security manager, its
checkListen
method is called with the
port
argument as its
 argument to ensure the operation is allowed. This could result
 in a SecurityException.
Parameters:
port
- the port to listen to
backlog
- how many connections are queued
ifAddress
- the network interface address to use
Returns:
the
ServerSocket
Throws:
IOException
- for networking errors
SecurityException
- if a security manager exists and its
checkListen
method doesn't allow the operation.
IllegalArgumentException
- if the port parameter is outside the
         specified range of valid port values, which is between 0 and
         65535, inclusive.
