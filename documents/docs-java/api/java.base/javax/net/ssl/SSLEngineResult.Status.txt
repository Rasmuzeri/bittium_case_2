operation.

 The
Status
value does not reflect the

Enum Constant
Description
BUFFER_OVERFLOW
The
SSLEngine
was not able to process the
 operation because there are not enough bytes available in the
 destination buffer to hold the result.
BUFFER_UNDERFLOW
The
SSLEngine
was not able to unwrap the
 incoming data because there were not enough source bytes
 available to make a complete packet.
CLOSED
The operation just closed this side of the
SSLEngine
, or the operation
 could not be completed because it was already closed.
OK
The
SSLEngine
completed the operation, and
 is available to process similar calls.
