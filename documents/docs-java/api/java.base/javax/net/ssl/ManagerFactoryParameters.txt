Interface ManagerFactoryParameters
All Known Implementing Classes:

public interface
ManagerFactoryParameters
This class is the base interface for providing
 algorithm-specific information to a KeyManagerFactory or
 TrustManagerFactory.
In some cases, initialization parameters other than keystores
 may be needed by a provider.  Users of that particular provider
 are expected to pass an implementation of the appropriate
 sub-interface of this class as defined by the
 provider.  The provider can then call the specified methods in
 the
ManagerFactoryParameters
implementation to obtain the
 needed information.
