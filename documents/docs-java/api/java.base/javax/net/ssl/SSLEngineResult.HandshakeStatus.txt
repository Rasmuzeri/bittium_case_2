Enum Constants
Enum Constant
Description
FINISHED
The
SSLEngine
has just finished handshaking.
NEED_TASK
The
SSLEngine
needs the results of one (or more)
 delegated tasks before handshaking can continue.
NEED_UNWRAP
The
SSLEngine
needs to receive data from the
 remote side before handshaking can continue.
NEED_UNWRAP_AGAIN
The
SSLEngine
needs to unwrap before handshaking can
 continue.
NEED_WRAP
The
SSLEngine
must send data to the remote side
 before handshaking can continue, so
SSLEngine.wrap()
should be called.
NOT_HANDSHAKING
The
SSLEngine
is not currently handshaking.

NOT_HANDSHAKING
public static final
SSLEngineResult.HandshakeStatus
NOT_HANDSHAKING
The
SSLEngine
is not currently handshaking.
FINISHED
public static final
SSLEngineResult.HandshakeStatus
FINISHED
The
SSLEngine
has just finished handshaking.
This value is only generated by a call to
SSLEngine.wrap()/unwrap()
when that call
 finishes a handshake.  It is never generated by
SSLEngine.getHandshakeStatus()
.

NEED_TASK
public static final
SSLEngineResult.HandshakeStatus
NEED_TASK
The
SSLEngine
needs the results of one (or more)
 delegated tasks before handshaking can continue.

NEED_WRAP
public static final
SSLEngineResult.HandshakeStatus
NEED_WRAP
The
SSLEngine
must send data to the remote side
 before handshaking can continue, so
SSLEngine.wrap()
should be called.

NEED_UNWRAP
public static final
SSLEngineResult.HandshakeStatus
NEED_UNWRAP
The
SSLEngine
needs to receive data from the
 remote side before handshaking can continue.
NEED_UNWRAP_AGAIN
public static final
SSLEngineResult.HandshakeStatus
NEED_UNWRAP_AGAIN
The
SSLEngine
needs to unwrap before handshaking can
 continue.
This value is used to indicate that not-yet-interpreted data
 has been previously received from the remote side, and does
 not need to be received again.
This handshake status only applies to DTLS.
