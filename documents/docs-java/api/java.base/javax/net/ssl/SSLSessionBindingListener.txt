Interface SSLSessionBindingListener
All Superinterfaces:
EventListener
public interface
SSLSessionBindingListener
extends
EventListener
This interface is implemented by objects which want to know when
 they are being bound or unbound from a SSLSession.  When either event
 occurs via
SSLSession.putValue(String, Object)
or
SSLSession.removeValue(String)
, the event is communicated
 through a SSLSessionBindingEvent identifying the session.
