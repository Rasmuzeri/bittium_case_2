String
[] keyType,
Principal

Choose an alias to authenticate the client side of an
SSLEngine
connection given the public key type
 and the list of certificate issuer authorities recognized by
 the peer (if any).
The default implementation returns null.
Parameters:
keyType
- the key algorithm type name(s), ordered
          with the most-preferred key type first.
issuers
- the list of acceptable CA issuer subject names
          or null if it does not matter which issuers are used.
engine
- the
SSLEngine
to be used for this
          connection.  This parameter can be null, which indicates
          that implementations of this interface are free to
          select an alias applicable to any engine.
Returns:
the alias name for the desired key, or null if there
          are no matches.
