Class SNIMatcher
java.lang.Object
javax.net.ssl.SNIMatcher
public abstract class
SNIMatcher
extends
Object
Instances of this class represent a matcher that performs match
 operations on an
SNIServerName
instance.
Servers can use Server Name Indication (SNI) information to decide if
 specific
SSLSocket
or
SSLEngine
instances should accept
 a connection.  For example, when multiple "virtual" or "name-based"
 servers are hosted on a single underlying network address, the server
 application can use SNI information to determine whether this server is
 the exact server that the client wants to access.  Instances of this
 class can be used by a server to verify the acceptable server names of
 a particular type, such as host names.
SNIMatcher
objects are immutable.  Subclasses should not provide
 methods that can change the state of an instance once it has been created.
Since:
1.8
