Class TrustManagerFactorySpi
java.lang.Object
javax.net.ssl.TrustManagerFactorySpi
public abstract class
TrustManagerFactorySpi
extends
Object
This class defines the
Service Provider Interface
(
SPI
)
 for the
TrustManagerFactory
class.
All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
 cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
 of a particular trust manager factory.
Since:
1.4

Initializes this factory with a source of certificate
 authorities and related trust material.
Parameters:

- the key store or null
Throws:
KeyStoreException
- if this operation fails

(
ManagerFactoryParameters
spec)
throws
InvalidAlgorithmParameterException
Initializes this factory with a source of provider-specific
 key material.
In some cases, initialization parameters other than a keystore
 may be needed by a provider.  Users of that
 particular provider are expected to pass an implementation of
 the appropriate
ManagerFactoryParameters
as
 defined by the provider.  The provider can then call the
 specified methods in the
ManagerFactoryParameters
implementation to obtain the needed information.
Parameters:
spec
- an implementation of a provider-specific parameter
          specification
Throws:
InvalidAlgorithmParameterException
- if there is problem
          with the parameters
See Also:
TrustManagerFactory.init(ManagerFactoryParameters spec)
engineGetTrustManagers
protected abstract
TrustManager
[]
engineGetTrustManagers
()
Returns one trust manager for each type of trust material.
Returns:
the trust managers
Throws:
IllegalStateException
- if the factory is not initialized.
