Package javax.net.ssl
package
javax.net.ssl
Provides classes for the secure socket package. Using the secure
 socket classes, you can communicate using SSL or a related security
 protocol to reliably detect any errors introduced into the network
 byte stream and to optionally encrypt the data and/or authenticate
 the communicating peers.

Service Provider Interface
(
SPI
)
 for the
SSLContext
class.
SSLEngine
A class which enables secure communications using protocols such as
 the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or
IETF RFC 2246 "Transport
 Layer Security" (TLS)
protocols, but is transport independent.
SSLEngineResult
An encapsulation of the result state produced by
SSLEngine
I/O calls.

SSLEngineResult
enum describing the current
 handshaking state of this

represents a set of
SSLSession
s associated with a single entity.
