Class SSLSessionBindingEvent
java.lang.Object
java.util.EventObject
javax.net.ssl.SSLSessionBindingEvent
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
SSLSessionBindingEvent
extends
EventObject
This event is propagated to a SSLSessionBindingListener.
 When a listener object is bound or unbound to an SSLSession by
SSLSession.putValue(String, Object)
or
SSLSession.removeValue(String)
, objects which
 implement the SSLSessionBindingListener will receive an
 event of this type.  The event's
name
field is the
 key in which the listener is being bound or unbound.
