javax.security.auth
This package provides a framework for authentication and
 authorization. The framework allows
 authentication to be performed in pluggable fashion. Different
 authentication modules can be plugged under an application without
 requiring modifications to the application itself. The
 authorization component allows specification of access controls
 based on code location, code signers and code executors
 (Subjects).
