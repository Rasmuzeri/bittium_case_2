Class ConfigurationSpi
java.lang.Object
javax.security.auth.login.ConfigurationSpi
public abstract class
ConfigurationSpi
extends
Object
This class defines the
Service Provider Interface
(
SPI
)
 for the
Configuration
class.
 All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
 service provider who wishes to supply a Configuration implementation.
Subclass implementations of this abstract class must provide
 a public constructor that takes a
Configuration.Parameters
object as an input parameter.  This constructor also must throw
 an IllegalArgumentException if it does not understand the
Configuration.Parameters
input.

Method Details

protected abstract
AppConfigurationEntry
[]
engineGetAppConfigurationEntry
(
String
name)
Retrieve the AppConfigurationEntries for the specified
name
.
Parameters:
name
- the name used to index the Configuration.
Returns:
an array of AppConfigurationEntries for the specified
name
, or null if there are no entries.
engineRefresh
protected
void
engineRefresh
()
Refresh and reload the Configuration.
This method causes this Configuration object to refresh/reload its
 contents in an implementation-dependent manner.
 For example, if this Configuration object stores its entries in a file,
 calling
refresh
may cause the file to be re-read.
The default implementation of this method does nothing.
 This method should be overridden if a refresh operation is supported
 by the implementation.
Throws:
SecurityException
- if the caller does not have permission
          to refresh its Configuration.
