public interface
Callback
Implementations of this interface are passed to a
CallbackHandler
, allowing underlying security services
 the ability to interact with a calling application to retrieve specific
 authentication data such as usernames and passwords, or to display
 certain information, such as error and warning messages.
Callback
implementations do not retrieve or
 display the information requested by underlying security services.
Callback
implementations simply provide the means
 to pass such requests to applications, and for applications,
 if appropriate, to return requested information back to the
 underlying security services.
Since:
1.4
