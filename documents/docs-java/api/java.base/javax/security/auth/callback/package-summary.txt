Description
Callback
Implementations of this interface are passed to a
CallbackHandler
, allowing underlying security services
 the ability to interact with a calling application to retrieve specific
 authentication data such as usernames and passwords, or to display
 certain information, such as error and warning messages.
CallbackHandler
An application implements a
CallbackHandler
and passes
 it to underlying security services so that they may interact with
 the application to retrieve specific authentication data,
 such as usernames and passwords, or to display certain information,
 such as error and warning messages.
ChoiceCallback
Underlying security services instantiate and pass a
ChoiceCallback
to the
handle
method of a
CallbackHandler
to display a list of choices
 and to retrieve the selected choice(s).
ConfirmationCallback
Underlying security services instantiate and pass a
ConfirmationCallback
to the
handle
method of a
CallbackHandler
to ask for YES/NO,
 OK/CANCEL, YES/NO/CANCEL or other similar confirmations.
LanguageCallback
Underlying security services instantiate and pass a
LanguageCallback
to the
handle
method of a
CallbackHandler
to retrieve the
Locale
used for localizing text.
NameCallback
Underlying security services instantiate and pass a
NameCallback
to the
handle
method of a
CallbackHandler
to retrieve name information.
PasswordCallback
Underlying security services instantiate and pass a
PasswordCallback
to the
handle
method of a
CallbackHandler
to retrieve password information.
TextInputCallback
Underlying security services instantiate and pass a
TextInputCallback
to the
handle
method of a
CallbackHandler
to retrieve generic text
 information.
TextOutputCallback
Underlying security services instantiate and pass a
TextOutputCallback
to the
handle
method of a
CallbackHandler
to display information messages,
 warning messages and error messages.
