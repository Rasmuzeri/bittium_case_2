Package javax.security.cert
package
javax.security.cert
Provides classes for public key certificates.

 The classes in this package have been deprecated. New classes should not
 be added to this package. These classes include a simplified version of
 the
java.security.cert
package.  These classes were developed as
 part of the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE).  When JSSE was added to
 the J2SE version 1.4, this package was added for backward-compatibility
 reasons only.

 New applications should not use this package, but rather
java.security.cert
.
Since:
1.4
