Class SecretKeyFactorySpi
java.lang.Object
javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactorySpi
public abstract class
SecretKeyFactorySpi
extends
Object
This class defines the
Service Provider Interface
(
SPI
)
 for the
SecretKeyFactory
class.
 All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
 cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
 of a secret-key factory for a particular algorithm.
A provider should document all the key specifications supported by its
 secret key factory.
 For example, the DES secret-key factory supplied by the "SunJCE" provider
 supports
DESKeySpec
as a transparent representation of DES
 keys, and that provider's secret-key factory for Triple DES keys supports
DESedeKeySpec
as a transparent representation of Triple DES
 keys.
Since:
1.4

engineGenerateSecret
protected abstract
SecretKey
engineGenerateSecret
(
KeySpec
keySpec)
throws
InvalidKeySpecException
Generates a
SecretKey
object from the
 provided key specification (key material).
Parameters:
keySpec
- the specification (key material) of the secret key
Returns:
the secret key
Throws:
InvalidKeySpecException
- if the given key specification
 is inappropriate for this secret-key factory to produce a secret key.
engineGetKeySpec
protected abstract
KeySpec
engineGetKeySpec
(
SecretKey
key,
Class
<?> keySpec)
throws
InvalidKeySpecException
Returns a specification (key material) of the given key
 object in the requested format.
Parameters:
key
- the key
keySpec
- the requested format in which the key material shall be
 returned
Returns:
the underlying key specification (key material) in the
 requested format
Throws:
InvalidKeySpecException
- if the requested key specification is
 inappropriate for the given key (e.g., the algorithms associated with
key
and
keySpec
do not match, or
key
references a key on a cryptographic hardware device
 whereas
keySpec
is the specification of a software-based
 key), or the given key cannot be dealt with
 (e.g., the given key has an algorithm or format not supported by this
 secret-key factory).
engineTranslateKey
protected abstract
SecretKey
engineTranslateKey
(
SecretKey
key)
throws
InvalidKeyException
Translates a key object, whose provider may be unknown or
 potentially untrusted, into a corresponding key object of this
 secret-key factory.
Parameters:
key
- the key whose provider is unknown or untrusted
Returns:
the translated key
Throws:
InvalidKeyException
- if the given key cannot be processed
 by this secret-key factory.
