javax.crypto.interfaces
Provides interfaces for Diffie-Hellman keys as defined in RSA
 Laboratories' PKCS #3.
Note that these interfaces are intended only for key
 implementations whose key material is accessible and
 available. These interfaces are not intended for key implementations
 whose key material resides in inaccessible, protected storage (such
 as in a hardware device).
For more developer information on how to use these interfaces,
 including information on how to design
Key
classes for
 hardware devices, please refer to the cryptographic provider
 developer guide:
How to Implement a Provider in the Java Cryptography Architecture
Package Specification
PKCS #3: Diffie-Hellman Key-Agreement Standard, Version 1.4,
       November 1993.
