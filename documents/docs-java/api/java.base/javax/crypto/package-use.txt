Class
Description
BadPaddingException
This exception is thrown when a particular padding mechanism is
 expected for the input data but the data is not padded properly.
Cipher
This class provides the functionality of a cryptographic cipher for
 encryption and decryption.
CipherSpi
This class defines the
Service Provider Interface
(
SPI
)
 for the
Cipher
class.
DecapsulateException
An exception that is thrown by the
KEM.Decapsulator.decapsulate(byte[])
method to denote an
 error during decapsulation.
ExemptionMechanism
This class provides the functionality of an exemption mechanism, examples
 of which are
key recovery
,
key weakening
, and
key escrow
.
ExemptionMechanismException
This is the generic ExemptionMechanism exception.
ExemptionMechanismSpi
This class defines the
Service Provider Interface
(
SPI
)
 for the
ExemptionMechanism
class.
IllegalBlockSizeException
This exception is thrown when the length of data provided to a block
 cipher is incorrect, i.e., does not match the block size of the cipher.
KEM
This class provides the functionality of a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM).
KEM.Decapsulator
A decapsulator, generated by
KEM.newDecapsulator(java.security.PrivateKey)
on the KEM
 receiver side.
KEM.Encapsulated
This class specifies the return value of the encapsulate method of
 a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), which includes the shared secret
 (as a
SecretKey
), the key encapsulation message,
 and optional parameters.
KEM.Encapsulator
An encapsulator, generated by
KEM.newEncapsulator(java.security.PublicKey)
on the KEM
 sender side.
KEMSpi.DecapsulatorSpi
The KEM decapsulator implementation, generated by
KEMSpi.engineNewDecapsulator(java.security.PrivateKey, java.security.spec.AlgorithmParameterSpec)
on the KEM receiver side.
KEMSpi.EncapsulatorSpi
The KEM encapsulator implementation, generated by
KEMSpi.engineNewEncapsulator(java.security.PublicKey, java.security.spec.AlgorithmParameterSpec, java.security.SecureRandom)
on the KEM sender side.
KeyAgreement
This class provides the functionality of a key agreement (or key
 exchange) protocol.
KeyAgreementSpi
This class defines the
Service Provider Interface
(
SPI
)
 for the
KeyAgreement
class.
KeyGenerator

KeyGeneratorSpi
This class defines the
Service Provider Interface
(
SPI
)
 for the
KeyGenerator
class.
Mac
This class provides the functionality of a "Message Authentication Code"
 (MAC) algorithm.
MacSpi
This class defines the
Service Provider Interface
(
SPI
)
 for the
Mac
class.
NoSuchPaddingException
This exception is thrown when a particular padding mechanism is
 requested but is not available in the environment.
SealedObject
This class enables a programmer to create an object and protect its
 confidentiality with a cryptographic algorithm.
SecretKey
A secret (symmetric) key.
SecretKeyFactory
This class represents a factory for secret keys.
SecretKeyFactorySpi
This class defines the
Service Provider Interface
(
SPI
)
 for the
SecretKeyFactory
class.
ShortBufferException
This exception is thrown when an output buffer provided by the user
 is too short to hold the operation result.
