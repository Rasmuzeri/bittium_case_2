Interface SecretKey
All Superinterfaces:
Destroyable
,
Key
,
Serializable
All Known Subinterfaces:
PBEKey
All Known Implementing Classes:
EncryptionKey
,
KerberosKey
,
SecretKeySpec
public interface
SecretKey
extends
Key
,
Destroyable
A secret (symmetric) key.
 The purpose of this interface is to group (and provide type safety
 for) all secret key interfaces.
Provider implementations of this interface must overwrite the
equals
and
hashCode
methods inherited from
Object
, so that secret keys are compared based on
 their underlying key material and not based on reference.
 Implementations should override the default
destroy
and
isDestroyed
methods from the
Destroyable
interface to enable
 sensitive key information to be destroyed, cleared, or in the case
 where such information is immutable, unreferenced.
 Finally, since
SecretKey
is
Serializable
, implementations
 should also override
ObjectOutputStream.writeObject(java.lang.Object)
to prevent keys that have been destroyed from being serialized.
Keys that implement this interface return the string
RAW
as their encoding format (see
getFormat
), and return the
 raw key bytes as the result of a
getEncoded
method call. (The
getFormat
and
getEncoded
methods are inherited
 from the
Key
parent interface.)
Since:
1.4
