Class MacSpi
java.lang.Object
javax.crypto.MacSpi
public abstract class
MacSpi
extends
Object
This class defines the
Service Provider Interface
(
SPI
)
 for the
Mac
class.
 All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
 cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
 of a particular MAC algorithm.
Implementations are free to implement the Cloneable interface.
Since:
1.4

Method Details
engineGetMacLength
protected abstract
int
engineGetMacLength
()
Returns the length of the MAC in bytes.
Returns:
the MAC length in bytes.
engineInit
protected abstract
void
engineInit
(
Key
key,
AlgorithmParameterSpec
params)
throws
InvalidKeyException
,
InvalidAlgorithmParameterException
Initializes the MAC with the given (secret) key and algorithm
 parameters.
Parameters:
key
- the (secret) key.
params
- the algorithm parameters.
Throws:
InvalidKeyException
- if the given key is inappropriate for
 initializing this MAC.
InvalidAlgorithmParameterException
- if the given algorithm
 parameters are inappropriate for this MAC.
engineUpdate
protected abstract
void
engineUpdate
(byte input)
Processes the given byte.
Parameters:
input
- the input byte to be processed.
engineUpdate
protected abstract
void
engineUpdate
(byte[] input,
 int offset,
 int len)
Processes the first
len
bytes in
input
,
 starting at
offset
inclusive.
Parameters:
input
- the input buffer.
offset
- the offset in
input
where the input starts.
len
- the number of bytes to process.
engineUpdate
protected
void
engineUpdate
(
ByteBuffer
input)
Processes
input.remaining()
bytes in the ByteBuffer
input
, starting at
input.position()
.
 Upon return, the buffer's position will be equal to its limit;
 its limit will not have changed.
Subclasses should consider overriding this method if they can
 process ByteBuffers more efficiently than byte arrays.
Parameters:
input
- the ByteBuffer
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
input
is null
Since:
1.5
engineDoFinal
protected abstract
byte[]
engineDoFinal
()
Completes the MAC computation and resets the MAC for further use,
 maintaining the secret key that the MAC was initialized with.
Returns:
the MAC result.
engineReset
protected abstract
void
engineReset
()
Resets the MAC for further use, maintaining the secret key that the
 MAC was initialized with.
clone
public
Object
clone
()
             throws
CloneNotSupportedException
Returns a clone if the implementation is cloneable.
Overrides:
clone
in class
Object
Returns:
a clone if the implementation is cloneable.
Throws:
CloneNotSupportedException
- if this is called
 on an implementation that does not support
Cloneable
.
