Class InheritableThreadLocal<T>
java.lang.Object
java.lang.ThreadLocal
<T>
java.lang.InheritableThreadLocal<T>
Type Parameters:
T
- the type of the inheritable thread local's value
public class
InheritableThreadLocal<T>
extends
ThreadLocal
<T>
This class extends
ThreadLocal
to provide inheritance of values
 from parent thread to child thread: when a child thread is created, the
 child receives initial values for all inheritable thread-local variables
 for which the parent has values.  Normally the child's values will be
 identical to the parent's; however, the child's value can be made an
 arbitrary function of the parent's by overriding the
childValue
method in this class.
Inheritable thread-local variables are used in preference to
 ordinary thread-local variables when the per-thread-attribute being
 maintained in the variable (e.g., User ID, Transaction ID) must be
 automatically transmitted to any child threads that are created.
Note: During the creation of a new
thread
, it is
 possible to
opt out
of receiving initial values for inheritable
 thread-local variables.

public
InheritableThreadLocal
()
Creates an inheritable thread local variable.
Method Details
childValue
protected
T
childValue
(
T
parentValue)
Computes the child's initial value for this inheritable thread-local
 variable as a function of the parent's value at the time the child
 thread is created.  This method is called from within the parent
 thread before the child is started.
This method merely returns its input argument, and should be overridden
 if a different behavior is desired.
Parameters:
parentValue
- the parent thread's value
Returns:
the child thread's initial value
