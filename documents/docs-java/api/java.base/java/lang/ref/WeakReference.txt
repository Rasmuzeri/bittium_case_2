Class WeakReference<T>
java.lang.Object
java.lang.ref.Reference
<T>
java.lang.ref.WeakReference<T>
Type Parameters:
T
- the type of the referent
public non-sealed class
WeakReference<T>
extends
Reference
<T>
Weak reference objects, which do not prevent their referents from being
 made finalizable, finalized, and then reclaimed.  Weak references are most
 often used to implement canonicalizing mappings.
Suppose that the garbage collector determines at a certain point in time
 that an object is
weakly
 reachable
.  At that time it will atomically clear all weak references to
 that object and all weak references to any other weakly-reachable objects
 from which that object is reachable through a chain of strong and soft
 references.  At the same time it will declare all of the formerly
 weakly-reachable objects to be finalizable.  At the same time or at some
 later time it will enqueue those newly-cleared weak references that are
 registered with reference queues.

Creates a new weak reference that refers to the given object.  The new
 reference is not registered with any queue.
Parameters:
referent
- object the new weak reference will refer to
WeakReference
public
WeakReference
(
