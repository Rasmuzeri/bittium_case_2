poll
public
Reference
<? extends
T
>
poll
()
Polls this queue to see if a reference object is available.  If one is
 available without further delay then it is removed from the queue and
 returned.  Otherwise this method immediately returns
null
.
Returns:
A reference object, if one was immediately available,
          otherwise
null
remove

Reference
<? extends
T
>
remove
(long timeout)
throws
InterruptedException
Removes the next reference object in this queue, blocking until either
 one becomes available or the given timeout period expires.
This method does not offer real-time guarantees: It schedules the
 timeout as if by invoking the
Object.wait(long)
method.
Parameters:
timeout
- If positive, block for up to
timeout
milliseconds while waiting for a reference to be
                  added to this queue.  If zero, block indefinitely.
Returns:
A reference object, if one was available within the specified
          timeout period, otherwise
null
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- If the value of the timeout argument is negative
InterruptedException
- If the timeout wait is interrupted
