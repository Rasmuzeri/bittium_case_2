Class PhantomReference<T>
java.lang.Object
java.lang.ref.Reference
<T>
java.lang.ref.PhantomReference<T>
Type Parameters:
T
- the type of the referent
public non-sealed class
PhantomReference<T>
extends
Reference
<T>
Phantom reference objects, which are enqueued after the collector
 determines that their referents may otherwise be reclaimed.  Phantom
 references are most often used to schedule post-mortem cleanup actions.
Suppose the garbage collector determines at a certain point in time
 that an object is
phantom reachable
.  At that time it will atomically clear
 all phantom references to that object and all phantom references to
 any other phantom-reachable objects from which that object is reachable.
 At the same time or at some later time it will enqueue those newly-cleared
 phantom references that are registered with reference queues.
In order to ensure that a reclaimable object remains so, the referent of
 a phantom reference may not be retrieved: The
get
method of a
 phantom reference always returns
null
.
 The
refersTo
method can be used to test
 whether some object is the referent of a phantom reference.

Constructor Details
PhantomReference
public
PhantomReference
(
T
referent,
ReferenceQueue
<? super
T
> q)
Creates a new phantom reference that refers to the given object and
 is registered with the given queue.
It is possible to create a phantom reference with a
null
queue.  Such a reference will never be enqueued.
Parameters:
referent
- the object the new phantom reference will refer to
q
- the queue with which the reference is to be registered,
          or
null
if registration is not required
Method Details
get
public
T
get
()
Returns this reference object's referent.  Because the referent of a
 phantom reference is always inaccessible, this method always returns
null
.
Overrides:
get
in class
Reference
<

Returns:
null
