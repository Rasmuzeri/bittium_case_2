public class
Error
extends
Throwable
An
Error
is a subclass of
Throwable
that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application
 should not try to catch. Most such errors are abnormal conditions.
A method is not required to declare in its
throws
clause any subclasses of
Error
that might be thrown
 during the execution of the method but not caught, since these
 errors are abnormal conditions that should never occur.

 That is,
Error
and its subclasses are regarded as unchecked
 exceptions for the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions.
See
Java Language Specification
:
11.2 Compile-Time Checking of Exceptions

Constructor Details
Error
public
Error
()
Constructs a new error with
null
as its detail message.
 The cause is not initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by a
 call to
Throwable.initCause(java.lang.Throwable)
.
Error
public
Error
(
String
message)
Constructs a new error with the specified detail message.  The
 cause is not initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by
 a call to
Throwable.initCause(java.lang.Throwable)
.
Parameters:
message
- the detail message. The detail message is saved for
          later retrieval by the
Throwable.getMessage()
method.
Error
public
Error
(
String
message,
Throwable
cause)
Constructs a new error with the specified detail message and
 cause.
Note that the detail message associated with
cause
is
not
automatically incorporated in
 this error's detail message.
Parameters:
message
- the detail message (which is saved for later retrieval
         by the
Throwable.getMessage()
method).
cause
- the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the
Throwable.getCause()
method).  (A
null
value is
         permitted, and indicates that the cause is nonexistent or
         unknown.)
Since:
1.4
Error
public
Error
(
Throwable
cause)
Constructs a new error with the specified cause and a detail
 message of
(cause==null ? null : cause.toString())
(which
 typically contains the class and detail message of
cause
).
 This constructor is useful for errors that are little more than
 wrappers for other throwables.
Parameters:
cause
- the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the
Throwable.getCause()
method).  (A
null
value is
         permitted, and indicates that the cause is nonexistent or
         unknown.)
Since:
1.4
Error
protected
Error
(
String
message,
Throwable
cause,
 boolean enableSuppression,
 boolean writableStackTrace)
Constructs a new error with the specified detail message,
 cause, suppression enabled or disabled, and writable stack
 trace enabled or disabled.
Parameters:
message
- the detail message.
cause
- the cause.  (A
null
value is permitted,
 and indicates that the cause is nonexistent or unknown.)
enableSuppression
- whether or not suppression is enabled
                          or disabled
writableStackTrace
- whether or not the stack trace should
                           be writable
