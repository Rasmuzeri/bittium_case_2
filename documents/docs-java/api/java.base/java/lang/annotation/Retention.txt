Retention
Indicates how long annotations with the annotated interface are to
 be retained.  If no Retention annotation is present on
 an annotation interface declaration, the retention policy defaults to
RetentionPolicy.CLASS
.
A Retention meta-annotation has effect only if the
 meta-annotated interface is used directly for annotation.  It has no
 effect if the meta-annotated interface is used as a member interface in
 another annotation interface.
