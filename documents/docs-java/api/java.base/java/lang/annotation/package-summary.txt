Class
Description
Annotation
The common interface extended by all annotation interfaces.
AnnotationFormatError
Thrown when the annotation parser attempts to read an annotation
 from a class file and determines that the annotation is malformed.
AnnotationTypeMismatchException
Thrown to indicate that a program has attempted to access an element of
 an annotation whose type has changed after the annotation was compiled
 (or serialized).
Documented
If the annotation
@Documented
is present on the declaration
 of an annotation interface
A
, then any
@A
annotation on
 an element is considered part of the element's public contract.
ElementType
The constants of this enumerated class provide a simple classification of the
 syntactic locations where annotations may appear in a Java program.
IncompleteAnnotationException
Thrown to indicate that a program has attempted to access an element of
 an annotation interface that was added to the annotation interface definition
 after the annotation was compiled (or serialized).
Inherited
Indicates that an annotation interface is automatically inherited.
Native
Indicates that a field defining a constant value may be referenced
 from native code.
Repeatable
The annotation interface
java.lang.annotation.Repeatable
is
 used to indicate that the annotation interface whose declaration it
 (meta-)annotates is
repeatable
.
Retention
Indicates how long annotations with the annotated interface are to
 be retained.
RetentionPolicy
Annotation retention policy.
Target
Indicates the contexts in which an annotation interface is applicable.
