Documented
If the annotation
@Documented
is present on the declaration
 of an annotation interface
A
, then any
@A
annotation on
 an element is considered part of the element's public contract.

 In more detail, when an annotation interface
A
is annotated with
Documented
, the presence and value of
A
annotations
 are a part of the public contract of the elements
A
annotates.

 Conversely, if an annotation interface
B
is
not
annotated with
Documented
, the presence and value of
B
annotations are
not
part of the public contract
 of the elements
B
annotates.

 Concretely, if an annotation interface is annotated with
Documented
,
 by default a tool like javadoc will display annotations of that interface
 in its output while annotations of annotation interfaces without
Documented
will not be displayed.
