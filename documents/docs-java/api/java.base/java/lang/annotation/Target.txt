java.lang.annotation
Annotation Interface Target
@Documented
@Retention
(
RUNTIME
)
@Target
(
ANNOTATION_TYPE
)
public @interface
Target
Indicates the contexts in which an annotation interface is applicable. The
 declaration contexts and type contexts in which an annotation interface may
 be applicable are specified in JLS
9.6.4.1
, and denoted in source code by
 enum constants of
java.lang.annotation.ElementType
.
If an
@Target
meta-annotation is not present on an annotation
 interface
T
, then an annotation of type
T
may be written as
 a modifier for any declaration.
If an
@Target
meta-annotation is present, the compiler will enforce
 the usage restrictions indicated by
ElementType
enum constants, in line with JLS
9.7.4
.
For example, this
@Target
meta-annotation indicates that the
 declared interface is itself a meta-annotation interface.  It can only be
 used on annotation interface declarations:
@Target(ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE)
    public @interface MetaAnnotationType {
        ...
    }
This
@Target
meta-annotation indicates that the declared class or
 interface is intended solely for use as a member class or interface in
 complex annotation interface declarations.  It cannot be used to annotate
 anything directly:
@Target({})
    public @interface MemberInterface {
        ...
    }
It is a compile-time error for a single
ElementType
constant to
 appear more than once in an
@Target
annotation.  For example, the
 following
@Target
meta-annotation is illegal:
@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.FIELD})
    public @interface Bogus {
        ...
    }
