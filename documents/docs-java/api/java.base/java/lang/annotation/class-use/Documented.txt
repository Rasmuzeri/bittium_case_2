Package
Description
java.beans
Contains classes related to developing
beans
-- components based on
 the JavaBeans architecture.
java.lang
Provides classes that are fundamental to the design of the Java
 programming language.
java.lang.annotation
Provides library support for the Java programming language
 annotation facility.
javax.annotation.processing
Facilities for declaring annotation processors and for
 allowing annotation processors to communicate with an annotation processing
 tool environment.
javax.management
Provides the core classes for the Java Management Extensions.

Description
@interface
BeanProperty
An annotation used to specify some property-related information for the
 automatically generated
BeanInfo
classes.
@interface
ConstructorProperties
An annotation on a constructor that shows how the parameters of
   that constructor correspond to the constructed object's getter
   methods.
@interface
JavaBean
An annotation used to specify some class-related information
 for the automatically generated

Description
@interface
Deprecated
A program element annotated
@Deprecated
is one that programmers

@interface
FunctionalInterface
An informative annotation type used to indicate that an interface
 type declaration is intended to be a
functional interface
as
 defined by the Java Language Specification.
@interface
SafeVarargs
A programmer assertion that the body of the annotated method or

Class
Description
@interface
Documented
If the annotation
@Documented
is present on the declaration
 of an annotation interface
A
, then any
@A
annotation on
 an element is considered part of the element's public contract.
@interface
Inherited
Indicates that an annotation interface is automatically inherited.
@interface
Native
Indicates that a field defining a constant value may be referenced
 from native code.
@interface
Repeatable
The annotation interface
java.lang.annotation.Repeatable
is
 used to indicate that the annotation interface whose declaration it
 (meta-)annotates is
repeatable
.
@interface
Retention
Indicates how long annotations with the annotated interface are to
 be retained.
@interface
Target
Indicates the contexts in which an annotation interface is applicable.
