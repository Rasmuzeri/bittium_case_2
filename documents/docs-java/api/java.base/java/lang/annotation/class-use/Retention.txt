Description
@interface
BeanProperty
An annotation used to specify some property-related information for the
 automatically generated
BeanInfo
classes.
@interface

   that constructor correspond to the constructed object's getter
   methods.
@interface

 should be declared with the given
value
when the
Introspector
constructs
 a
PropertyDescriptor

@interface
Deprecated
A program element annotated
@Deprecated
is one that programmers
 are discouraged from using.
@interface
FunctionalInterface
An informative annotation type used to indicate that an interface
 type declaration is intended to be a
functional interface
as
 defined by the Java Language Specification.
@interface
Override
Indicates that a method declaration is intended to override a
 method declaration in a supertype.
@interface
SafeVarargs
A programmer assertion that the body of the annotated method or
 constructor does not perform potentially unsafe operations on its
 varargs parameter.
@interface
SuppressWarnings
Indicates the warnings to be suppressed at compile time in the
 annotated element, and in all elements contained in the annotated
 element.

Description
@interface
Documented
If the annotation
@Documented
is present on the declaration
 of an annotation interface
A
, then any
@A
annotation on
 an element is considered part of the element's public contract.
@interface
Inherited
Indicates that an annotation interface is automatically inherited.
@interface
Native
Indicates that a field defining a constant value may be referenced
 from native code.
@interface
Repeatable
The annotation interface
java.lang.annotation.Repeatable
is
 used to indicate that the annotation interface whose declaration it
 (meta-)annotates is
repeatable
.
@interface
Retention
Indicates how long annotations with the annotated interface are to
 be retained.
@interface
Target
Indicates the contexts in which an annotation interface is applicable.
