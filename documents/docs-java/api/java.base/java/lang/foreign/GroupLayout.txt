GroupLayout
is a preview API of the Java platform.
Programs can only use
GroupLayout
when preview features are enabled.
Preview features may be removed in a future release, or upgraded to permanent features of the Java platform.
A compound layout that is an aggregation of multiple, heterogeneous
member layouts
. There are two ways in which member layouts
 can be combined: if member layouts are laid out one after the other, the resulting group layout is a
struct layout
PREVIEW
; conversely, if all member layouts are laid out at the same starting offset,
 the resulting group layout is a
union layout
PREVIEW
.
Implementation Requirements:
This class is immutable, thread-safe and
value-based
.

memberLayouts
()
Returns the member layouts of this group layout.
API Note:
the order in which member layouts are returned is the same order in which member layouts have
 been passed to one of the group layout factory methods (see
MemoryLayout.structLayout(MemoryLayout...)
PREVIEW
,
MemoryLayout.unionLayout(MemoryLayout...)
PREVIEW
).
Returns:
the member layouts of this group layout

Returns a memory layout with the same characteristics as this layout, but with the given name.
Specified by:
withName
in interface
MemoryLayout
PREVIEW
Parameters:
name
- the layout name.
Returns:
a memory layout with the same characteristics as this layout, but with the given name
See Also:

()
Returns a memory layout with the same characteristics as this layout, but with no name.
Specified by:
withoutName
in interface
MemoryLayout
PREVIEW
Returns:
a memory layout with the same characteristics as this layout, but with no name
See Also:

PREVIEW
withByteAlignment
GroupLayout
PREVIEW
withByteAlignment
(long byteAlignment)
Returns a memory layout with the same characteristics as this layout, but with the given
 alignment constraint (in bytes).
Specified by:
withByteAlignment
in interface
MemoryLayout
PREVIEW
Parameters:
byteAlignment
- the layout alignment constraint, expressed in bytes.
Returns:
a memory layout with the same characteristics as this layout, but with the given
 alignment constraint (in bytes)
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
byteAlignment
is not a power of two.
IllegalArgumentException
- if
byteAlignment
is less than
M
, where
M
is the maximum alignment
 constraint in any of the member layouts associated with this group layout.
