ProcessHandle.Info
Information snapshot about the process.
 The attributes of a process vary by operating system and are not available
 in all implementations.  Information about processes is limited
 by the operating system privileges of the process making the request.
 The return types are
Optional<T>
allowing explicit tests
 and actions if the value is available.

Description
Optional
<
String
[]>
arguments
()
Returns an array of Strings of the arguments of the process.
Optional
<
String
>
command
()
Returns the executable pathname of the process.
Optional
<
String
>
commandLine
()
Returns the command line of the process.
Optional
<
Instant
>
startInstant
()
Returns the start time of the process.
Optional
<
Duration
>
totalCpuDuration
()
Returns the total cputime accumulated of the process.
Optional
<
String
>
user
()
Return the user of the process.
Method Details
command
Optional
<
String
>
command
()
Returns the executable pathname of the process.
Returns:
an
Optional<String>
of the executable pathname
         of the process
commandLine
Optional
<
String
>
commandLine
()
Returns the command line of the process.
If
command()
and
arguments()
return
 non-empty optionals, this is simply a convenience method which concatenates
 the values of the two functions separated by spaces. Otherwise it will return a
 best-effort, platform dependent representation of the command line.
API Note:
Note that the returned executable pathname and the
          arguments may be truncated on some platforms due to system
          limitations.
The executable pathname may contain only the
          name of the executable without the full path information.
          It is undecidable whether white space separates different
          arguments or is part of a single argument.
Returns:
an
Optional<String>
of the command line
         of the process
arguments
Optional
<
String
[]>
arguments
()
Returns an array of Strings of the arguments of the process.
API Note:
On some platforms, native applications are free to change
          the arguments array after startup and this method may only
          show the changed values.
Returns:
an
Optional<String[]>
of the arguments of the process
startInstant
Optional
<
Instant
>
startInstant
()
Returns the start time of the process.
Returns:
an
Optional<Instant>
of the start time of the process
totalCpuDuration
Optional
<
Duration
>
totalCpuDuration
()
Returns the total cputime accumulated of the process.
Returns:
an
Optional<Duration>
for the accumulated total cputime
user
Optional
<
String
>
user
()
Return the user of the process.
Returns:
an
Optional<String>
for the user of the process
