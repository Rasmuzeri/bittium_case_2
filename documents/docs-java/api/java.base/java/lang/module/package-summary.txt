Classes to support module descriptors and creating configurations of modules
 by means of resolution and service binding.
Unless otherwise noted, passing a
null
argument to a constructor
 or method of any class or interface in this package will cause a
NullPointerException
to be thrown. Additionally,
 invoking a method with an array or collection containing a
null
element
 will cause a
NullPointerException
, unless otherwise specified.
Module Resolution
Resolution is the process of computing how modules depend on each other.
 The process occurs at compile time and run time.
Resolution is a two-step process. The first step recursively enumerates
 the 'requires' directives of a set of root modules. If all the enumerated
 modules are observable, then the second step computes their readability graph.
 The readability graph embodies how modules depend on each other, which in
 turn controls access across module boundaries.
Step 1: Recursive enumeration
Recursive enumeration takes a set of module names, looks up each of their
 module declarations, and for each module declaration, recursively enumerates:
the module names given by the 'requires' directives with the
   'transitive' modifier, and
at the discretion of the host system, the module names given by
   the 'requires' directives without the 'transitive' modifier.
Module declarations are looked up in a set of observable modules. The set
 of observable modules is determined in an implementation specific manner. The
 set of observable modules may include modules with explicit declarations
 (that is, with a
module-info.java
source file or
module-info.class
file) and modules with implicit declarations (that is,
automatic modules
).
 Because an automatic module has no explicit module declaration, it has no
 'requires' directives of its own, although its name may be given by a
 'requires' directive of an explicit module declaration.
The set of root modules, whose names are the initial input to this
 algorithm, is determined in an implementation specific manner. The set of
 root modules may include automatic modules.
If at least one automatic module is enumerated by this algorithm, then
 every observable automatic module must be enumerated, regardless of whether
 any of their names are given by 'requires' directives of explicit module
 declarations.
If any of the following conditions occur, then resolution fails:
Any root module is not observable.
Any module whose name is given by a 'requires' directive with the
   'transitive' modifier is not observable.
At the discretion of the host system, any module whose name is given
   by a 'requires' directive without the 'transitive' modifier is not
   observable.
The algorithm in this step enumerates the same module name twice. This
   indicates a cycle in the 'requires' directives, disregarding any 'transitive'
   modifiers.
Otherwise, resolution proceeds to step 2.
Step 2: Computing the readability graph
A 'requires' directive (irrespective of 'transitive') expresses that
 one module depends on some other module. The effect of the 'transitive'
 modifier is to cause additional modules to also depend on the other module.
 If module M 'requires transitive N', then not only does M depend on N, but
 any module that depends on M also depends on N. This allows M to be
 refactored so that some or all of its content can be moved to a new module N
 without breaking modules that have a 'requires M' directive.
Module dependencies are represented by the readability graph. The
 readability graph is a directed graph whose vertices are the modules
 enumerated in step 1 and whose edges represent readability between pairs of
 modules. The edges are specified as follows:
First, readability is determined by the 'requires' directives of the
 enumerated modules, disregarding any 'transitive' modifiers:
For each enumerated module A that 'requires' B: A "reads" B.
For each enumerated module X that is automatic: X "reads" every
   other enumerated module (it is "as if" an automatic module has 'requires'
   directives for every other enumerated module).
Second, readability is augmented to account for 'transitive' modifiers:
For each enumerated module A that "reads" B:
If B 'requires transitive' C, then A "reads" C as well as B. This
     augmentation is recursive: since A "reads" C, if C 'requires transitive'
     D, then A "reads" D as well as C and B.
If B is an automatic module, then A "reads" every other enumerated
     automatic module. (It is "as if" an automatic module has 'requires transitive'
     directives for every other enumerated automatic module).
Finally, every module "reads" itself.
If any of the following conditions occur in the readability graph, then
 resolution fails:
A module "reads" two or more modules with the same name. This includes
   the case where a module "reads" another with the same name as itself.
Two or more modules export a package with the same name to a module
   that "reads" both. This includes the case where a module M containing package
   p "reads" another module that exports p to M.
A module M declares that it 'uses p.S' or 'provides p.S with ...' but
   package p is neither in module M nor exported to M by any module that M
   "reads".
Otherwise, resolution succeeds, and the result of resolution is the
 readability graph.
Root modules
The set of root modules at compile-time is usually the set of modules
 being compiled. At run-time, the set of root modules is usually the
 application module specified to the 'java' launcher. When compiling code in
 the unnamed module, or at run-time when the main application class is loaded
 from the class path, then the default set of root modules is implementation
 specific. In the JDK the default set of root modules contains every module
 that is observable on the upgrade module path or among the system modules,
 and that exports at least one package without qualification.
Observable modules
The set of observable modules at both compile-time and run-time is
 determined by searching several different paths, and also by searching
 the compiled modules built in to the environment. The search order is as
 follows:
At compile time only, the compilation module path. This path
   contains module definitions in source form.
The upgrade module path. This path contains compiled definitions of
   modules that will be observed in preference to the compiled definitions of
   any
upgradeable modules
that are present in (3) and (4). See the Java
   SE Platform for the designation of which standard modules are upgradeable.
The system modules, which are the compiled definitions built in to
   the environment.
The application module path. This path contains compiled definitions
   of library and application modules.
'requires' directives with 'static' modifier
'requires' directives that have the 'static' modifier express an optional
 dependence at run time. If a module declares that it 'requires static M' then
 resolution does not search the observable modules for M to satisfy the dependency.
 However, if M is recursively enumerated at step 1 then all modules that are
 enumerated and `requires static M` will read M.
Completeness
Resolution may be partial at compile-time in that the complete transitive
 closure may not be required to compile a set of modules. Minimally, the
 readability graph that is constructed and validated at compile-time includes
 the modules being compiled, their direct dependences, and all implicitly
 declared dependences (requires transitive).
At run-time, resolution is an additive process. The recursive enumeration
 at step 1 may be relative to previous resolutions so that a root module,
 or a module named in a 'requires' directive, is not enumerated when it was
 enumerated by a previous (or parent) resolution. The readability graph that
 is the result of resolution may therefore have a vertex for a module enumerated
 in step 1 but with an edge to represent that the module reads a module that
 was enumerated by previous (or parent) resolution.
