Method Details
service

String
service
()
Returns the fully qualified class name of the service type.
Returns:
The fully qualified class name of the service type
providers
public
List
<
String
>
providers
()
Returns the list of the fully qualified class names of the providers
 or provider factories.
Returns:
A non-empty and unmodifiable list of the fully qualified class
         names of the providers or provider factories
compareTo
public
int
compareTo
(
ModuleDescriptor.Provides
that)
Compares this
Provides
to another.
Two
Provides
objects are compared by comparing the fully
 qualified class name of the service type lexicographically. Where the
 class names are equal then the list of the provider class names are
 compared by comparing the corresponding elements of both lists
 lexicographically and in sequence. Where the lists differ in size,
N
is the size of the shorter list, and the first
N
corresponding elements are equal, then the longer list is considered
 to succeed the shorter list.

compareTo
in interface
Comparable
<
ModuleDescriptor.Provides

Parameters:
that
- The
Provides
to compare
Returns:
A negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if this
Provides
is less than, equal to, or greater than
         the given
Provides
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Computes a hash code for this
Provides
.
The hash code is based upon the service type and the set of
 providers. It satisfies the general contract of the
Object.hashCode
method.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
The hash-code value for this module provides

Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
ob)
Tests this
Provides
for equality with the given object.
If the given object is not a
Provides
then this method
 returns
false
. Two
Provides
objects are equal if the
 service type is equal and the list of providers is equal.
This method satisfies the general contract of the
Object.equals
method.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
ob
- the object to which this object is to be compared
Returns:
true
if, and only if, the given object is a
Provides
that is equal to this
Provides
See Also:
Object.hashCode()
HashMap
toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns a string describing this
Provides
.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
A string describing this
Provides
