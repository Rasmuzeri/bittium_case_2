Class ProcessBuilder.Redirect
java.lang.Object
java.lang.ProcessBuilder.Redirect
Enclosing class:
ProcessBuilder
public abstract static class
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
extends
Object
Represents a source of subprocess input or a destination of
 subprocess output.

 Each
Redirect
instance is one of the following:
the special value
Redirect.PIPE
the special value
Redirect.INHERIT
the special value
Redirect.DISCARD
a redirection to read from a file, created by an invocation of
Redirect.from(File)
a redirection to write to a file,  created by an invocation of
Redirect.to(File)
a redirection to append to a file, created by an invocation of
Redirect.appendTo(File)
Each of the above categories has an associated unique
Type
.

Field Details
PIPE
public static final
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
PIPE
Indicates that subprocess I/O will be connected to the
 current Java process over a pipe.

 This is the default handling of subprocess standard I/O.
It will always be true that
Redirect.PIPE.file() == null &&
 Redirect.PIPE.type() == Redirect.Type.PIPE
INHERIT
public static final
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
INHERIT
Indicates that subprocess I/O source or destination will be the
 same as those of the current process.  This is the normal
 behavior of most operating system command interpreters (shells).
It will always be true that
Redirect.INHERIT.file() == null &&
 Redirect.INHERIT.type() == Redirect.Type.INHERIT
DISCARD
public static final
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
DISCARD
Indicates that subprocess output will be discarded.
 A typical implementation discards the output by writing to
 an operating system specific "null file".
It will always be true that
Redirect.DISCARD.file() is the filename appropriate for the operating system
 and may be null &&
 Redirect.DISCARD.type() == Redirect.Type.WRITE

Method Details
type
public abstract
ProcessBuilder.Redirect.Type
type
()
Returns the type of this
Redirect
.
Returns:
the type of this
Redirect
file
public
File
file
()
Returns the
File
source or destination associated
 with this redirect, or
null
if there is no such file.
Returns:
the file associated with this redirect,
         or
null
if there is no such file
from
public static
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
from
(
File
file)
Returns a redirect to read from the specified file.
It will always be true that
Redirect.from(file).file() == file &&
 Redirect.from(file).type() == Redirect.Type.READ
Parameters:
file
- The
File
for the
Redirect
.
Returns:
a redirect to read from the specified file
to
public static
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
to
(
File
file)
Returns a redirect to write to the specified file.
 If the specified file exists when the subprocess is started,
 its previous contents will be discarded.
It will always be true that
Redirect.to(file).file() == file &&
 Redirect.to(file).type() == Redirect.Type.WRITE
Parameters:
file
- The
File
for the
Redirect
.
Returns:
a redirect to write to the specified file
appendTo
public static
ProcessBuilder.Redirect
appendTo
(
File
file)
Returns a redirect to append to the specified file.
 Each write operation first advances the position to the
 end of the file and then writes the requested data.
 Whether the advancement of the position and the writing
 of the data are done in a single atomic operation is
 system-dependent and therefore unspecified.
It will always be true that
Redirect.appendTo(file).file() == file &&
 Redirect.appendTo(file).type() == Redirect.Type.APPEND
Parameters:
file
- The
File
for the
Redirect
.
Returns:
a redirect to append to the specified file
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Compares the specified object with this
Redirect
for
 equality.  Returns
true
if and only if the two
 objects are identical or both objects are
Redirect
instances of the same type associated with non-null equal
File
instances.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- the reference object with which to compare.
Returns:
true
if this object is the same as the obj
          argument;
false
otherwise.

Returns:
a hash code value for this
Redirect
