Method Details
of
public static
Character.UnicodeBlock
of
(char c)
Returns the object representing the Unicode block containing the
 given character, or
null
if the character is not a
 member of a defined block.
Note:
This method cannot handle
supplementary
 characters
.  To support all Unicode characters, including
 supplementary characters, use the
of(int)
method.
Parameters:
c
- The character in question
Returns:
The
UnicodeBlock
instance representing the
          Unicode block of which this character is a member, or
null
if the character is not a member of any
          Unicode block
of
public static
Character.UnicodeBlock
of
(int codePoint)
Returns the object representing the Unicode block
 containing the given character (Unicode code point), or
null
if the character is not a member of a
 defined block.
Parameters:
codePoint
- the character (Unicode code point) in question.
Returns:
The
UnicodeBlock
instance representing the
          Unicode block of which this character is a member, or
null
if the character is not a member of any
          Unicode block
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the specified
codePoint
is an invalid Unicode code point.
Since:
1.5
See Also:
Character.isValidCodePoint(int)
forName
public static final
Character.UnicodeBlock
forName
(
String
blockName)
Returns the UnicodeBlock with the given name. Block
 names are determined by The Unicode Standard. The file
Blocks.txt
defines blocks for a particular
 version of the standard. The
Character
class specifies
 the version of the standard that it supports.
This method accepts block names in the following forms:
Canonical block names as defined by the Unicode Standard.
 For example, the standard defines a "Basic Latin" block. Therefore, this
 method accepts "Basic Latin" as a valid block name. The documentation of
 each UnicodeBlock provides the canonical name.
Canonical block names with all spaces removed. For example, "BasicLatin"
 is a valid block name for the "Basic Latin" block.
The text representation of each constant UnicodeBlock identifier.
 For example, this method will return the
BASIC_LATIN
block if
 provided with the "BASIC_LATIN" name. This form replaces all spaces and
 hyphens in the canonical name with underscores.
Finally, character case is ignored for all of the valid block name forms.
 For example, "BASIC_LATIN" and "basic_latin" are both valid block names.
 The en_US locale's case mapping rules are used to provide case-insensitive
 string comparisons for block name validation.
If the Unicode Standard changes block names, both the previous and
 current names will be accepted.
Parameters:
blockName
- A
UnicodeBlock
name.
Returns:
The
UnicodeBlock
instance identified
         by
blockName
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
blockName
is an
         invalid name
NullPointerException
- if
blockName
is null
