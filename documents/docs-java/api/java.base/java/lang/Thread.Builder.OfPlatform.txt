Interface Thread.Builder.OfPlatform
All Superinterfaces:
Thread.Builder
Enclosing interface:
Thread.Builder
public static sealed interface
Thread.Builder.OfPlatform
extends
Thread.Builder
A builder for creating a platform
Thread
or
ThreadFactory
that creates platform threads.
Unless otherwise specified, passing a null argument to a method in
 this interface causes a
NullPointerException
to be thrown.

Thread.Builder.OfPlatform
name
(
String
name)
Description copied from interface:
Thread.Builder
Sets the thread name.
Specified by:
name
in interface
Thread.Builder
Parameters:
name
- thread name
Returns:
this builder
name
Thread.Builder.OfPlatform
name
(
String
prefix,
 long start)
Description copied from interface:
Thread.Builder
Sets the thread name to be the concatenation of a string prefix and
 the string representation of a counter value. The counter's initial
 value is
start
. It is incremented after a
Thread
is
 created with this builder so that the next thread is named with
 the new counter value. A
ThreadFactory
created with this
 builder is seeded with the current value of the counter. The
ThreadFactory
increments its copy of the counter after
newThread
is used to create a
Thread
.
Specified by:
name
in interface
Thread.Builder
Parameters:
prefix
- thread name prefix
start
- the starting value of the counter
Returns:
this builder
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if start is negative
inheritInheritableThreadLocals
Thread.Builder.OfPlatform
inheritInheritableThreadLocals
(boolean inherit)
Description copied from interface:
Thread.Builder
Sets whether the thread inherits the initial values of
inheritable-thread-local
variables from the
 constructing thread. The default is to inherit.
Specified by:
inheritInheritableThreadLocals
in interface
Thread.Builder
Parameters:
inherit
-
true
to inherit,
false
to not inherit
Returns:
this builder
uncaughtExceptionHandler
Thread.Builder.OfPlatform
uncaughtExceptionHandler
(
Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler
ueh)
Description copied from interface:
Thread.Builder
Sets the uncaught exception handler.
Specified by:
uncaughtExceptionHandler
in interface
Thread.Builder
Parameters:
ueh
- uncaught exception handler
Returns:
this builder
group
Thread.Builder.OfPlatform
group
(
ThreadGroup
group)
Sets the thread group.
Parameters:
group
- the thread group
Returns:
this builder
daemon
Thread.Builder.OfPlatform
daemon
(boolean on)
Sets the daemon status.
Parameters:
on
-
true
to create daemon threads
Returns:
this builder
daemon
default
Thread.Builder.OfPlatform
daemon
()
Sets the daemon status to
true
.
Implementation Requirements:
The default implementation invokes
daemon(boolean)
with
 a value of
true
.
Returns:
this builder
priority
Thread.Builder.OfPlatform
priority
(int priority)
Sets the thread priority.
Parameters:
priority
- priority
Returns:
this builder
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the priority is less than
Thread.MIN_PRIORITY
or greater than
Thread.MAX_PRIORITY
stackSize
Thread.Builder.OfPlatform
stackSize
(long stackSize)
Sets the desired stack size.
The stack size is the approximate number of bytes of address space
 that the Java virtual machine is to allocate for the thread's stack. The
 effect is highly platform dependent and the Java virtual machine is free
 to treat the
stackSize
parameter as a "suggestion". If the value
 is unreasonably low for the platform then a platform specific minimum
 may be used. If the value is unreasonably high then a platform specific
 maximum may be used. A value of zero is always ignored.
Parameters:
stackSize
- the desired stack size
Returns:
this builder
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the stack size is negative
