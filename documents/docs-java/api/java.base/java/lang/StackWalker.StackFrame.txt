Interface StackWalker.StackFrame
Enclosing class:
StackWalker
public static interface
StackWalker.StackFrame
A
StackFrame
object represents a method invocation returned by
StackWalker
.
The
getDeclaringClass()
method may be unsupported as determined
 by the
stack walking options
of a
stack walker
.

binary name
of the declaring class of the method represented by this stack frame.
Returns:
the binary name of the declaring class of the method
         represented by this stack frame
See
Java Language Specification
:
13.1 The Form of a Binary
getMethodName

Returns:
the name of the method represented by this stack frame
getDeclaringClass
Class
<?>
getDeclaringClass
()
Gets the declaring
Class
for the method represented by
 this stack frame.
Returns:
the declaring
Class
of the method represented by
 this stack frame
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException
- if this
StackWalker
is not configured with
Option.RETAIN_CLASS_REFERENCE
.

getByteCodeIndex
int
getByteCodeIndex
()
Returns the index to the code array of the
Code
attribute
 containing the execution point represented by this stack frame.
 The code array gives the actual bytes of Java Virtual Machine code
 that implement the method.
Returns:
the index to the code array of the
Code
attribute
         containing the execution point represented by this stack frame,
         or a negative number if the method is native.

Java Virtual Machine Specification
:
4.7.3 The
Code
Attribute
getFileName
String
getFileName
()
Returns the name of the source file containing the execution point
 represented by this stack frame.  Generally, this corresponds
 to the
SourceFile
attribute of the relevant
class
file as defined by
The Java Virtual Machine Specification
.
 In some systems, the name may refer to some source code unit
 other than a file, such as an entry in a source repository.
Returns:
the name of the file containing the execution point
         represented by this stack frame, or
null
if
         this information is unavailable.
See
Java Virtual Machine Specification
:
4.7.10 The
SourceFile
Attribute
getLineNumber
int
getLineNumber
()
Returns the line number of the source line containing the execution
 point represented by this stack frame.  Generally, this is
 derived from the
LineNumberTable
attribute of the relevant
class
file as defined by
The Java Virtual Machine
 Specification
.
Returns:
the line number of the source line containing the execution
         point represented by this stack frame, or a negative number if
         this information is unavailable.
See
Java Virtual Machine Specification
:
4.7.12 The
LineNumberTable
Attribute

if the method containing the execution point
         represented by this stack frame is a native method.
toStackTraceElement
StackTraceElement
toStackTraceElement
()
Gets a
StackTraceElement
for this stack frame.
Returns:
StackTraceElement
for this stack frame.
