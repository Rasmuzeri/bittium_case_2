Packages that use
LinkageError
Package

java.lang
Provides classes that are fundamental to the design of the Java
 programming language.
java.lang.reflect
Provides classes and interfaces for obtaining reflective information about
 classes and objects.
Uses of
LinkageError
in
java.lang
Subclasses of

in
java.lang
Modifier and Type
Class
Description
class
AbstractMethodError
Thrown when an application tries to call an abstract method.
class
BootstrapMethodError
Thrown to indicate that an
invokedynamic
instruction or a dynamic
 constant failed to resolve its bootstrap method and arguments,
 or for
invokedynamic
instruction the bootstrap method has failed to
 provide a
call site
with a
target
of the correct
method type
,
 or for a dynamic constant the bootstrap method has failed to provide a
 constant value of the required type.
class
ClassCircularityError
Thrown when the Java Virtual Machine detects a circularity in the
 superclass hierarchy of a class being loaded.
class
ClassFormatError
Thrown when the Java Virtual Machine attempts to read a class
 file and determines that the file is malformed or otherwise cannot
 be interpreted as a class file.
class
ExceptionInInitializerError
Signals that an unexpected exception has occurred in a static initializer.
class
IllegalAccessError
Thrown if an application attempts to access or modify a field, or
 to call a method that it does not have access to.
class
IncompatibleClassChangeError
Thrown when an incompatible class change has occurred to some class
 definition.
class
InstantiationError
Thrown when an application tries to use the Java
new
construct to instantiate an abstract class or an interface.
class
NoClassDefFoundError
Thrown if the Java Virtual Machine or a
ClassLoader
instance
 tries to load in the definition of a class (as part of a normal method call
 or as part of creating a new instance using the
new
expression)
 and no definition of the class could be found.
class
NoSuchFieldError
Thrown if an application tries to access or modify a specified
 field of an object, and that object no longer has that field.
class
NoSuchMethodError
Thrown if an application tries to call a specified method of a
 class (either static or instance), and that class no longer has a
 definition of that method.
class
UnsatisfiedLinkError
Thrown if the Java Virtual Machine cannot find an appropriate
 native-language definition of a method declared
native
.
class
UnsupportedClassVersionError
Thrown when the Java Virtual Machine attempts to read a class
 file and determines that the major and minor version numbers
 in the file are not supported.
class
VerifyError
Thrown when the "verifier" detects that a class file,
 though well formed, contains some sort of internal inconsistency
 or security problem.
