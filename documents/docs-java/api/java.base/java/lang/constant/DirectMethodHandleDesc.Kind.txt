[]
values
()
Returns an array containing the constants of this enum class, in
the order they are declared.
Returns:
an array containing the constants of this enum class, in the order they are declared
valueOf
public static
DirectMethodHandleDesc.Kind
valueOf
(
String
name)
Returns the enum constant of this class with the specified name.
The string must match
exactly
an identifier used to declare an
enum constant in this class.  (Extraneous whitespace characters are 
not permitted.)
Parameters:
name
- the name of the enum constant to be returned.
Returns:
the enum constant with the specified name
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if this enum class has no constant with the specified name
NullPointerException
- if the argument is null
valueOf
public static
DirectMethodHandleDesc.Kind
valueOf
(int refKind)
Returns the enumeration member with the given
refKind
field.
 Behaves as if
valueOf(refKind, false)
.  As a special case,
 if
refKind
is
REF_invokeInterface
(9) then the
isInterface
field will be true.
Parameters:
refKind
- refKind of desired member
Returns:
the matching enumeration member
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if there is no such member
valueOf
public static
DirectMethodHandleDesc.Kind
valueOf
(int refKind,
 boolean isInterface)
Returns the enumeration member with the given the
refKind
and
isInterface
arguments.
 For most values of
refKind
there is an exact match regardless of the value of
isInterface
.
 These are:
REF_invokeVirtual
which matches to
VIRTUAL
REF_invokeInterface
which matches to
INTERFACE_VIRTUAL
REF_newInvokeSpecial
which matches to
CONSTRUCTOR
REF_getField
which matches to
GETTER
REF_putField
which matches to
SETTER
REF_getStatic
which matches to
STATIC_GETTER
REF_putStatic
which matches to
STATIC_SETTER
As for the rest, the returned kind will depend on the value (false or true accordingly) of
isInterface
:
REF_invokeStatic
which matches to
STATIC
or
INTERFACE_STATIC
REF_invokeSpecial
which matches to
SPECIAL
or
INTERFACE_SPECIAL
Parameters:
refKind
- refKind of desired member
isInterface
- whether desired member is for interface methods
Returns:
the matching enumeration member
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if there is no such member
