Interface Constable

Constable
Represents a type which is
constable
.  A constable type is one whose
 values are constants that can be represented in the constant pool of a Java
 classfile as described in JVMS
4.4
, and whose instances can describe themselves
 nominally as a
ConstantDesc
.
Some constable types have a native representation in the constant pool:
String
,
Integer
,
Long
,
Float
,
Double
,
Class
,
MethodType
, and
MethodHandle
.
 The types
String
,
Integer
,
Long
,
Float
,
 and
Double
serve as their own nominal descriptors;
Class
,
MethodType
, and
MethodHandle
have corresponding nominal
 descriptors
ClassDesc
,
MethodTypeDesc
, and
MethodHandleDesc
.
Other reference types can be constable if their instances can describe
 themselves in nominal form as a
ConstantDesc
. Examples in the Java SE
 Platform API are types that support Java language features such as
Enum
,
 and runtime support classes such as
VarHandle
.  These are typically
 described with a
DynamicConstantDesc
, which describes dynamically
 generated constants (JVMS
4.4.10
).
The nominal form of an instance of a constable type is obtained via
describeConstable()
. A
Constable
need
 not be able to (or may choose not to) describe all its instances in the form of
 a
ConstantDesc
; this method returns an
Optional
that can be
 empty to indicate that a nominal descriptor could not be created for an instance.
 (For example,
MethodHandle
will produce nominal descriptors for direct
 method handles, but not necessarily those produced by method handle
 combinators.)
