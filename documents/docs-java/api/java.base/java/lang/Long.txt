The
Long
class wraps a value of the primitive type
long
in an object. An object of type
Long
contains a
 single field whose type is
long
.
In addition, this class provides several methods for converting
 a
long
to a
String
and a
String
to a
long
, as well as other constants and methods useful when dealing
 with a
long
.
This is a
value-based
class; programmers should treat instances that are
equal
as interchangeable and should not
 use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may
 occur. For example, in a future release, synchronization may fail.
Implementation note: The implementations of the "bit twiddling"
 methods (such as
highestOneBit
and
numberOfTrailingZeros
) are
 based on material from Henry S. Warren, Jr.'s
Hacker's
 Delight
, (Addison Wesley, 2002).

Method Details
toString
public static
String
toString
(long i,
 int radix)
Returns a string representation of the first argument in the
 radix specified by the second argument.
If the radix is smaller than
Character.MIN_RADIX
or larger than
Character.MAX_RADIX
, then the radix
10
is used instead.
If the first argument is negative, the first element of the
 result is the ASCII minus sign
'-'
(
'\u002d'
). If the first argument is not
 negative, no sign character appears in the result.
The remaining characters of the result represent the magnitude
 of the first argument. If the magnitude is zero, it is
 represented by a single zero character
'0'
(
'\u0030'
); otherwise, the first character of
 the representation of the magnitude will not be the zero
 character.  The following ASCII characters are used as digits:
0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
These are
'\u0030'
through
'\u0039'
and
'\u0061'
through
'\u007a'
. If
radix
is
N
, then the first
N
of these characters
 are used as radix-
N
digits in the order shown. Thus,
 the digits for hexadecimal (radix 16) are
0123456789abcdef
. If uppercase letters are
 desired, the
String.toUpperCase()
method may
 be called on the result:
Long.toString(n, 16).toUpperCase()
Parameters:
i
- a
long
to be converted to a string.
radix
- the radix to use in the string representation.
Returns:
a string representation of the argument in the specified radix.
See Also:
Character.MAX_RADIX
Character.MIN_RADIX
toUnsignedString
public static
String
toUnsignedString
(long i,
 int radix)
Returns a string representation of the first argument as an
 unsigned integer value in the radix specified by the second
 argument.
If the radix is smaller than
Character.MIN_RADIX
or larger than
Character.MAX_RADIX
, then the radix
10
is used instead.
Note that since the first argument is treated as an unsigned
 value, no leading sign character is printed.
If the magnitude is zero, it is represented by a single zero
 character
'0'
(
'\u0030'
); otherwise,
 the first character of the representation of the magnitude will
 not be the zero character.
The behavior of radixes and the characters used as digits
 are the same as
toString
.
Parameters:
i
- an integer to be converted to an unsigned string.
radix
- the radix to use in the string representation.
Returns:
an unsigned string representation of the argument in the specified radix.
Since:
1.8
See Also:
toString(long, int)
toHexString
public static
String
toHexString
(long i)
Returns a string representation of the
long
argument as an unsigned integer in base 16.
The unsigned
long
value is the argument plus
 2
64
if the argument is negative; otherwise, it is
 equal to the argument.  This value is converted to a string of
 ASCII digits in hexadecimal (base 16) with no extra
 leading
0
s.
The value of the argument can be recovered from the returned
 string
s
by calling
Long.parseUnsignedLong(s,
 16)
.
If the unsigned magnitude is zero, it is represented by a
 single zero character
'0'
(
'\u0030'
);
 otherwise, the first character of the representation of the
 unsigned magnitude will not be the zero character. The
 following characters are used as hexadecimal digits:
0123456789abcdef
These are the characters
'\u0030'
through
'\u0039'
and
'\u0061'
through
'\u0066'
.  If uppercase letters are desired,
 the
String.toUpperCase()
method may be called
 on the result:
Long.toHexString(n).toUpperCase()
API Note:
The
HexFormat
class provides formatting and parsing
 of byte arrays and primitives to return a string or adding to an
Appendable
.
HexFormat
formats and parses uppercase or lowercase hexadecimal characters,
 with leading zeros and for byte arrays includes for each byte
 a delimiter, prefix, and suffix.
Parameters:
i
- a
long
to be converted to a string.
Returns:
the string representation of the unsigned
long
value represented by the argument in hexadecimal
          (base 16).

toOctalString
(long i)
Returns a string representation of the
long
argument as an unsigned integer in base 8.
The unsigned
long
value is the argument plus
 2
64
if the argument is negative; otherwise, it is
 equal to the argument.  This value is converted to a string of
 ASCII digits in octal (base 8) with no extra leading
0
s.
The value of the argument can be recovered from the returned
 string
s
by calling
Long.parseUnsignedLong(s,
 8)
.
If the unsigned magnitude is zero, it is represented by a
 single zero character
'0'
(
'\u0030'
);
 otherwise, the first character of the representation of the
 unsigned magnitude will not be the zero character. The
 following characters are used as octal digits:

parseLong
(
String
s,
 int radix)
throws
NumberFormatException
Parses the string argument as a signed
long
in the
 radix specified by the second argument. The characters in the
 string must all be digits of the specified radix (as determined
 by whether
Character.digit(char, int)
returns
 a nonnegative value), except that the first character may be an
 ASCII minus sign
'-'
(
'\u002D'
) to
 indicate a negative value or an ASCII plus sign
'+'
(
'\u002B'
) to indicate a positive value. The
 resulting
long
value is returned.
Note that neither the character
L
(
'\u004C'
) nor
l
(
'\u006C'
) is permitted to appear at the end
 of the string as a type indicator, as would be permitted in
 Java programming language source code - except that either
L
or
l
may appear as a digit for a
 radix greater than or equal to 22.
An exception of type
NumberFormatException
is
 thrown if any of the following situations occurs:
The first argument is
null
or is a string of
 length zero.
The
radix
is either smaller than
Character.MIN_RADIX
or larger than
Character.MAX_RADIX
.
Any character of the string is not a digit of the specified
 radix, except that the first character may be a minus sign
'-'
(
'\u002d'
) or plus sign
'+'
(
'\u002B'
) provided that the string is
 longer than length 1.
The value represented by the string is not a value of type
long
.

getLong
public static
Long
getLong
(
String

Determines the
long
value of the system property
 with the specified name.
The first argument is treated as the name of a system
 property.  System properties are accessible through the
System.getProperty(java.lang.String)
method. The
 string value of this property is then interpreted as a
long
value using the grammar supported by
decode
and a
Long
object representing this value is returned.
If there is no property with the specified name, if the
 specified name is empty or
null
, or if the property
 does not have the correct numeric format, then
null
is
 returned.
In other words, this method returns a
Long
object
 equal to the value of:
getLong(nm, null)
Parameters:
nm
- property name.
Returns:
the
Long
value of the property.

value of the system property
 with the specified name.
The first argument is treated as the name of a system
 property.  System properties are accessible through the
System.getProperty(java.lang.String)
method. The
 string value of this property is then interpreted as a
long
value using the grammar supported by
decode
and a
Long
object representing this value is returned.
The second argument is the default value. A
Long
object
 that represents the value of the second argument is returned if there
 is no property of the specified name, if the property does not have
 the correct numeric format, or if the specified name is empty or null.
In other words, this method returns a
Long
object equal
 to the value of:
getLong(nm, Long.valueOf(val))
but in practice it may be implemented in a manner such as:
Long result = getLong(nm, null);
 return (result == null) ? Long.valueOf(val) : result;
to avoid the unnecessary allocation of a
Long
object when
 the default value is not needed.
Parameters:

Returns the
long
value of the system property with
 the specified name.  The first argument is treated as the name
 of a system property.  System properties are accessible through
 the
System.getProperty(java.lang.String)
method. The string value of this property is then interpreted
 as a
long
value, as per the
decode
method, and a
Long
object
 representing this value is returned; in summary:
If the property value begins with the two ASCII characters
0x
or the ASCII character
#
, not followed by
 a minus sign, then the rest of it is parsed as a hexadecimal integer
 exactly as for the method
valueOf(java.lang.String, int)
with radix 16.
If the property value begins with the ASCII character
0
followed by another character, it is parsed as
 an octal integer exactly as by the method
valueOf(java.lang.String, int)
with radix 8.
Otherwise the property value is parsed as a decimal
 integer exactly as by the method
valueOf(java.lang.String, int)
with radix 10.
Note that, in every case, neither
L
(
'\u004C'
) nor
l
(
'\u006C'
) is permitted to appear at the end
 of the property value as a type indicator, as would be
 permitted in Java programming language source code.
The second argument is the default value. The default value is
 returned if there is no property of the specified name, if the
 property does not have the correct numeric format, or if the
 specified name is empty or
null
.
Parameters:
nm
- property name.
val
- default value.
Returns:
the
Long
value of the property.

rotateLeft
public static
long
rotateLeft
(long i,
 int distance)
Returns the value obtained by rotating the two's complement binary
 representation of the specified
long
value left by the
 specified number of bits.  (Bits shifted out of the left hand, or
 high-order, side reenter on the right, or low-order.)
Note that left rotation with a negative distance is equivalent to
 right rotation:
rotateLeft(val, -distance) == rotateRight(val,
 distance)
.  Note also that rotation by any multiple of 64 is a
 no-op, so all but the last six bits of the rotation distance can be
 ignored, even if the distance is negative:
rotateLeft(val,
 distance) == rotateLeft(val, distance & 0x3F)
.
Parameters:
i
- the value whose bits are to be rotated left
distance
- the number of bit positions to rotate left
Returns:
the value obtained by rotating the two's complement binary
     representation of the specified
long
value left by the
     specified number of bits.
Since:
1.5
rotateRight
public static
long
rotateRight
(long i,
 int distance)
Returns the value obtained by rotating the two's complement binary
 representation of the specified
long
value right by the
 specified number of bits.  (Bits shifted out of the right hand, or
 low-order, side reenter on the left, or high-order.)
Note that right rotation with a negative distance is equivalent to
 left rotation:
rotateRight(val, -distance) == rotateLeft(val,
 distance)
.  Note also that rotation by any multiple of 64 is a
 no-op, so all but the last six bits of the rotation distance can be
 ignored, even if the distance is negative:
rotateRight(val,
 distance) == rotateRight(val, distance & 0x3F)
.
Parameters:
i
- the value whose bits are to be rotated right
distance
- the number of bit positions to rotate right
Returns:
the value obtained by rotating the two's complement binary
     representation of the specified
long
value right by the
     specified number of bits.

reverse
public static
long
reverse
(long i)
Returns the value obtained by reversing the order of the bits in the
 two's complement binary representation of the specified
long
value.
Parameters:
i
- the value to be reversed
Returns:
the value obtained by reversing order of the bits in the
     specified
long
value.

compress
public static
long
compress
(long i,
 long mask)
Returns the value obtained by compressing the bits of the
 specified
long
value,
i
, in accordance with
 the specified bit mask.
For each one-bit value
mb
of the mask, from least
 significant to most significant, the bit value of
i
at
 the same bit location as
mb
is assigned to the compressed
 value contiguously starting from the least significant bit location.
 All the upper remaining bits of the compressed value are set
 to zero.
API Note:
Consider the simple case of compressing the digits of a hexadecimal
 value:
Copy
// Compressing drink to food
compress(0xCAFEBABEL, 0xFF00FFF0L) == 0xCABABL
Starting from the least significant hexadecimal digit at position 0
 from the right, the mask
0xFF00FFF0
selects hexadecimal digits
 at positions 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of
0xCAFEBABE
. The selected digits
 occur in the resulting compressed value contiguously from digit position
 0 in the same order.
The following identities all return
true
and are helpful to
 understand the behaviour of
compress
:
Copy
// Returns 1 if the bit at position n is one
compress(x, 1L << n) == (x >> n & 1)

// Logical shift right
compress(x, -1L << n) == x >>> n

// Any bits not covered by the mask are ignored
compress(x, m) == compress(x & m, m)

// Compressing a value by itself
compress(m, m) == (m == -1 || m == 0) ? m : (1L << bitCount(m)) - 1

// Expanding then compressing with the same mask
compress(expand(x, m), m) == x & compress(m, m)
The Sheep And Goats (SAG) operation (see Hacker's Delight, section 7.7)
 can be implemented as follows:
Copy
long compressLeft(long i, long mask) {
    // This implementation follows the description in Hacker's Delight which
    // is informative. A more optimal implementation is:
    //   Long.compress(i, mask) << -Long.bitCount(mask)
    return Long.reverse(
        Long.compress(Long.reverse(i), Long.reverse(mask)));
}

long sag(long i, long mask) {
    return compressLeft(i, mask) | Long.compress(i, ~mask);
}

// Separate the sheep from the goats
sag(0x00000000_CAFEBABEL, 0xFFFFFFFF_FF00FFF0L) == 0x00000000_CABABFEEL
Parameters:
i
- the value whose bits are to be compressed
mask
- the bit mask
Returns:
the compressed value

expand(long, long)
expand
public static
long
expand
(long i,
 long mask)
Returns the value obtained by expanding the bits of the
 specified
long
value,
i
, in accordance with
 the specified bit mask.
For each one-bit value
mb
of the mask, from least
 significant to most significant, the next contiguous bit value
 of
i
starting at the least significant bit is assigned
 to the expanded value at the same bit location as
mb
.
 All other remaining bits of the expanded value are set to zero.
API Note:
Consider the simple case of expanding the digits of a hexadecimal
 value:
Copy
expand(0x0000CABABL, 0xFF00FFF0L) == 0xCA00BAB0L
Starting from the least significant hexadecimal digit at position 0
 from the right, the mask
0xFF00FFF0
selects the first five
 hexadecimal digits of
0x0000CABAB
. The selected digits occur
 in the resulting expanded value in order at positions 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7.
The following identities all return
true
and are helpful to
 understand the behaviour of
expand
:
Copy
// Logically shift right the bit at position 0
expand(x, 1L << n) == (x & 1) << n

// Logically shift right
expand(x, -1L << n) == x << n

// Expanding all bits returns the mask
expand(-1L, m) == m

// Any bits not covered by the mask are ignored
expand(x, m) == expand(x, m) & m

// Compressing then expanding with the same mask
expand(compress(x, m), m) == x & m
The select operation for determining the position of the one-bit with
 index
n
in a
long
value can be implemented as follows:
Copy
long select(long i, long n) {
    // the one-bit in i (the mask) with index n
    long nthBit = Long.expand(1L << n, i);
    // the bit position of the one-bit with index n
    return Long.numberOfTrailingZeros(nthBit);
}

// The one-bit with index 0 is at bit position 1
select(0b10101010_10101010, 0) == 1
// The one-bit with index 3 is at bit position 7
select(0b10101010_10101010, 3) == 7
