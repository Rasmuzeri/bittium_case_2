public interface
Cloneable
A class implements the
Cloneable
interface to
 indicate to the
Object.clone()
method that it
 is legal for that method to make a
 field-for-field copy of instances of that class.
Invoking Object's clone method on an instance that does not implement the
Cloneable
interface results in the exception
CloneNotSupportedException
being thrown.
By convention, classes that implement this interface should override
Object.clone
(which is protected) with a public method.
 See
Object.clone()
for details on overriding this
 method.
Note that this interface does
not
contain the
clone
method.
 Therefore, it is not possible to clone an object merely by virtue of the
 fact that it implements this interface.  Even if the clone method is invoked
 reflectively, there is no guarantee that it will succeed.
Since:
1.0
