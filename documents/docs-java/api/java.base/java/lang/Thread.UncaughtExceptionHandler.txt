@FunctionalInterface
public static interface
Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler
Interface for handlers invoked when a
Thread
abruptly
 terminates due to an uncaught exception.
When a thread is about to terminate due to an uncaught exception
 the Java Virtual Machine will query the thread for its
UncaughtExceptionHandler
using
Thread.getUncaughtExceptionHandler()
and will invoke the handler's
uncaughtException
method, passing the thread and the
 exception as arguments.
 If a thread has not had its
UncaughtExceptionHandler
explicitly set, then its
ThreadGroup
object acts as its
UncaughtExceptionHandler
. If the
ThreadGroup
object
 has no
 special requirements for dealing with the exception, it can forward
 the invocation to the
default uncaught exception handler
.
Since:
1.5
