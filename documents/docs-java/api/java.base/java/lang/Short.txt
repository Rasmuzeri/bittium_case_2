The
Short
class wraps a value of primitive type
short
in an object.  An object of type
Short
contains a
 single field whose type is
short
.
In addition, this class provides several methods for converting
 a
short
to a
String
and a
String
to a
short
, as well as other constants and methods useful when
 dealing with a
short
.
This is a
value-based
class; programmers should treat instances that are
equal
as interchangeable and should not
 use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may
 occur. For example, in a future release, synchronization may fail.

Short
object.
Constructs a newly allocated
Short
object that

value indicated by the
String
parameter. The string is converted to a
short
value in exactly the manner used by the
parseShort
method for radix 10.
Parameters:

- the
String
to be converted to a
Short
Throws:

- If the
String
does not contain a parsable
short
.

. The radix is assumed to be 10.
Parameters:

throws
NumberFormatException
Parses the string argument as a signed
short
in the
 radix specified by the second argument. The characters in the
 string must all be digits, of the specified radix (as
 determined by whether
Character.digit(char, int)
returns a nonnegative value) except that the first
 character may be an ASCII minus sign
'-'
(
'\u002D'
) to indicate a negative value or an
 ASCII plus sign
'+'
(
'\u002B'
) to
 indicate a positive value.  The resulting
short
value
 is returned.
An exception of type
NumberFormatException
is
 thrown if any of the following situations occurs:
The first argument is
null
or is a string of
 length zero.
The radix is either smaller than
Character.MIN_RADIX
or larger than
Character.MAX_RADIX
.
Any character of the string is not a digit of the
 specified radix, except that the first character may be a minus
 sign
'-'
(
'\u002D'
) or plus sign
'+'
(
'\u002B'
) provided that the
 string is longer than length 1.
The value represented by the string is not a value of type
short
.
Parameters:
s
- the
String
containing the
short
representation to be parsed
radix
- the radix to be used while parsing
s
Returns:
the
short
represented by the string
                  argument in the specified radix.
Throws:
NumberFormatException
- If the
String
does not contain a parsable
short
.
parseShort
public static
short
parseShort
(
String
s)
throws
NumberFormatException
Parses the string argument as a signed decimal
short
. The characters in the string must all be decimal
 digits, except that the first character may be an ASCII minus
 sign
'-'
(
'\u002D'
) to indicate a
 negative value or an ASCII plus sign
'+'
(
'\u002B'
) to indicate a positive value.  The
 resulting
short
value is returned, exactly as if the
 argument and the radix 10 were given as arguments to the
parseShort(java.lang.String, int)
method.
Parameters:
s
- a
String
containing the
short
representation to be parsed
Returns:
the
short
value represented by the
          argument in decimal.
Throws:
NumberFormatException
- If the string does not
          contain a parsable
short
.
valueOf
public static
Short
valueOf
(
String
s,
 int radix)
throws
NumberFormatException
Returns a
Short
object holding the value
 extracted from the specified
String
when parsed
 with the radix given by the second argument. The first argument
 is interpreted as representing a signed
short
in
 the radix specified by the second argument, exactly as if the
 argument were given to the
parseShort(java.lang.String, int)
method. The result is a
Short
object that
 represents the
short
value specified by the string.
In other words, this method returns a
Short
object
 equal to the value of:
Short.valueOf(Short.parseShort(s, radix))
Parameters:
s
- the string to be parsed
radix
- the radix to be used in interpreting
s
Returns:
a
Short
object holding the value
                  represented by the string argument in the
                  specified radix.
Throws:
NumberFormatException
- If the
String
does
                  not contain a parsable
short
.
valueOf
public static
Short
valueOf
(
String
s)
throws
NumberFormatException
Returns a
Short
object holding the
 value given by the specified
String
. The argument
 is interpreted as representing a signed decimal
short
, exactly as if the argument were given to
 the
parseShort(java.lang.String)
method. The result is
 a
Short
object that represents the
short
value specified by the string.
In other words, this method returns a
Short
object
 equal to the value of:
Short.valueOf(Short.parseShort(s))
Parameters:
s
- the string to be parsed
Returns:
a
Short
object holding the value
          represented by the string argument
Throws:
NumberFormatException
- If the
String
does
          not contain a parsable
short

valueOf
public static
Short
valueOf
(short s)
Returns a
Short
instance representing the specified
short
value.
 If a new
Short
instance is not required, this method
 should generally be used in preference to the constructor
Short(short)
, as this method is likely to yield
 significantly better space and time performance by caching
 frequently requested values.

 This method will always cache values in the range -128 to 127,
 inclusive, and may cache other values outside of this range.
Parameters:
s
- a short value.
Returns:
a
Short
instance representing
s

The sequence of characters following an optional
 sign and/or radix specifier ("

", "
0X
",
 "
#
", or leading zero) is parsed as by the
Short.parseShort
method with the indicated radix (10, 16, or
 8).  This sequence of characters must represent a positive
 value or a
NumberFormatException
will be thrown.  The
 result is negated if first character of the specified
String
is the minus sign.  No whitespace characters are
 permitted in the
String
.
Parameters:
nm
- the
String
to decode.
Returns:
a
Short
object holding the
short
value represented by
nm
Throws:

toUnsignedInt
public static
int
toUnsignedInt
(short x)
Converts the argument to an
int
by an unsigned
 conversion.  In an unsigned conversion to an
int
, the
 high-order 16 bits of the
int
are zero and the
 low-order 16 bits are equal to the bits of the
short
argument.

 Consequently, zero and positive
short
values are mapped
 to a numerically equal
int
value and negative
short
values are mapped to an
int
value equal to the
 input plus 2
16
.
Parameters:
x
- the value to convert to an unsigned
int
Returns:
the argument converted to

(short x)
Converts the argument to a
long
by an unsigned
 conversion.  In an unsigned conversion to a
long
, the
 high-order 48 bits of the
long
are zero and the
 low-order 16 bits are equal to the bits of the
short
argument.

 Consequently, zero and positive
short
values are mapped
 to a numerically equal
long
value and negative
short
values are mapped to a
long
value equal to the
 input plus 2
16
.
Parameters:
x
- the value to convert to an unsigned
long
Returns:
the argument converted to
long
by an unsigned
         conversion
