Lookup::defineHiddenClass
method is dynamically added as a new member
 to the nest of a lookup class and/or whether a hidden class has
 a strong relationship with the class loader marked as its defining loader.

Enum Constant Details
NESTMATE
public static final
MethodHandles.Lookup.ClassOption
NESTMATE
Specifies that a hidden class be added to
nest
of a lookup class as a nestmate.
A hidden nestmate class has access to the private members of all
 classes and interfaces in the same nest.
See Also:
Class.getNestHost()
STRONG
public static final
MethodHandles.Lookup.ClassOption
STRONG
Specifies that a hidden class has a
strong
relationship with the class loader marked as its defining loader,
 as a normal class or interface has with its own defining loader.
 This means that the hidden class may be unloaded if and only if
 its defining loader is not reachable and thus may be reclaimed
 by a garbage collector (JLS
12.7
).
By default, a hidden class or interface may be unloaded
 even if the class loader that is marked as its defining loader is
reachable
.
