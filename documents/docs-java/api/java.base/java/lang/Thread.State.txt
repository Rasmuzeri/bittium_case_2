A thread state.  A thread can be in one of the following states:
NEW
A thread that has not yet started is in this state.
RUNNABLE
A thread executing in the Java virtual machine is in this state.
BLOCKED
A thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock
     is in this state.
WAITING
A thread that is waiting indefinitely for another thread to
     perform a particular action is in this state.
TIMED_WAITING
A thread that is waiting for another thread to perform an action
     for up to a specified waiting time is in this state.
TERMINATED
A thread that has exited is in this state.
A thread can be in only one state at a given point in time.
 These states are virtual machine states which do not reflect
 any operating system thread states.

NEW
public static final
Thread.State
NEW
Thread state for a thread which has not yet started.
RUNNABLE
public static final
Thread.State
RUNNABLE
Thread state for a runnable thread.  A thread in the runnable
 state is executing in the Java virtual machine but it may
 be waiting for other resources from the operating system
 such as processor.
BLOCKED
public static final
Thread.State
BLOCKED
Thread state for a thread blocked waiting for a monitor lock.
 A thread in the blocked state is waiting for a monitor lock
 to enter a synchronized block/method or
 reenter a synchronized block/method after calling
Object.wait
.
WAITING
public static final
Thread.State
WAITING
Thread state for a waiting thread.
 A thread is in the waiting state due to calling one of the
 following methods:
Object.wait
with no timeout
Thread.join
with no timeout
LockSupport.park
A thread in the waiting state is waiting for another thread to
 perform a particular action.

 For example, a thread that has called
Object.wait()
on an object is waiting for another thread to call
Object.notify()
or
Object.notifyAll()
on
 that object. A thread that has called
Thread.join()
is waiting for a specified thread to terminate.
TIMED_WAITING
public static final
Thread.State
TIMED_WAITING
Thread state for a waiting thread with a specified waiting time.
 A thread is in the timed waiting state due to calling one of
 the following methods with a specified positive waiting time:
Thread.sleep
Object.wait
with timeout
Thread.join
with timeout
LockSupport.parkNanos
LockSupport.parkUntil
TERMINATED
public static final
Thread.State
TERMINATED
Thread state for a terminated thread.
 The thread has completed execution.
