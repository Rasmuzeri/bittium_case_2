Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Thread.stop()
was originally specified to "stop" a victim
      thread by causing the victim thread to throw a
ThreadDeath
. It
      was inherently unsafe and deprecated in an early JDK release. The ability
      to "stop" a thread with
Thread.stop
has been removed and the
Thread.stop
method changed to throw an exception. Consequently,
ThreadDeath
is also deprecated, for removal.
An instance of
ThreadDeath
was originally specified to be thrown
 by a victim thread when "stopped" with
Thread.stop()
.
