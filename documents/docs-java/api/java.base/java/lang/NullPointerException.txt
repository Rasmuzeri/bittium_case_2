Returns the detail message string of this throwable.
If a non-null message was supplied in a constructor it is
 returned. Otherwise, an implementation specific message or
null
is returned.

Implementation Note:
If no explicit message was passed to the constructor, and as
 long as certain internal information is available, a verbose
 description of the null reference is returned.
 The internal information is not available in deserialized
 NullPointerExceptions.
Returns:

null
