Class file format versions of the Java virtual machine.

 See the appropriate edition of
The Java Virtual Machine
 Specification
for information about a particular class file
 format version.
Note that additional class file format version constants will be
 added to model future releases of the Java Virtual Machine
 Specification.
API Note:
The complete version used in a class file includes a major version
 and a minor version; this enum only models the major version. A
 Java virtual machine implementation is required to support a range
 of major versions; see the corresponding edition of the
The
 Java Virtual Machine Specification
for details.

()
Returns an array containing the constants of this enum class, in
the order they are declared.
Returns:

valueOf
public static
ClassFileFormatVersion
valueOf
(
String
name)
Returns the enum constant of this class with the specified name.
The string must match
exactly
an identifier used to declare an
enum constant in this class.  (Extraneous whitespace characters are 
not permitted.)
Parameters:
name
- the name of the enum constant to be returned.
Returns:
the enum constant with the specified name
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if this enum class has no constant with the specified name
NullPointerException
- if the argument is null

latest
()
Returns the latest class file format version.
Returns:
the latest class file format version
major
public
int
major
()
Returns the major class file version as an integer.
Returns:
the major class file version as an integer
See
Java Virtual Machine Specification
:
4.1 The
ClassFile
Structure
valueOf
public static
ClassFileFormatVersion
valueOf
(
Runtime.Version
rv)
Returns the latest class file format version that is usable
 under the runtime version argument. If the runtime version's
feature
is greater than
 the feature of the
runtime
 version
of the
latest class file format
 version
, an
IllegalArgumentException
is thrown.
Because the class file format versions of the Java platform
 have so far followed a linear progression, only the feature
 component of a runtime version is queried to determine the
 mapping to a class file format version. If that linearity
 changes in the future, other components of the runtime version
 may influence the result.
API Note:
An expression to convert from a string value, for example
"17"
, to the corresponding class file format version,
RELEASE_17
, is:
Copy
ClassFileFormatVersion.valueOf(Runtime.Version.parse("17"))
Parameters:
rv
- runtime version to map to a class file format version
Returns:
the latest class file format version that is usable
 under the runtime version argument
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the feature of version
 argument is greater than the feature of the platform version.
runtimeVersion
public
Runtime.Version
runtimeVersion
()
Returns the least runtime version that supports this class
 file format version; otherwise
null
. The returned
 runtime version has a
feature
large enough to support this class file format version
 and has no other elements set.

 Class file format versions greater than or equal to
RELEASE_6
have non-
null
results.
Returns:
the least runtime version that supports this class
 file format version; otherwise
null
fromMajor
public static
ClassFileFormatVersion
fromMajor
(int major)
Returns the latest class file format version whose major class
 file version matches the argument.
Parameters:
major
- the major class file version as an integer
Returns:
the latest class file format version whose major class
 file version matches the argument
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the argument is outside of
 the range of major class file versions
