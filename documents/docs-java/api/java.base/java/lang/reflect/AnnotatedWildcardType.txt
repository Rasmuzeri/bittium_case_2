Method Details
getAnnotatedLowerBounds
AnnotatedType
[]
getAnnotatedLowerBounds
()
Returns the potentially annotated lower bounds of this wildcard type.
 If no lower bound is explicitly declared, the lower bound is the
 type of null. In this case, a zero length array is returned.
API Note:
While to date a wildcard may have at most one lower
 bound, callers of this method should be written to accommodate
 multiple bounds.
Returns:
the potentially annotated lower bounds of this wildcard type or
 an empty array if no lower bound is explicitly declared.
See Also:
WildcardType.getLowerBounds()
getAnnotatedUpperBounds
AnnotatedType
[]
getAnnotatedUpperBounds
()
Returns the potentially annotated upper bounds of this wildcard type.
 If no upper bound is explicitly declared, the upper bound is
 unannotated
Object
API Note:

 bound, callers of this method should be written to accommodate
 multiple bounds.
Returns:
the potentially annotated upper bounds of this wildcard type

WildcardType.getUpperBounds()
getAnnotatedOwnerType
AnnotatedType
getAnnotatedOwnerType
()
Returns the potentially annotated type that this type is a member of, if
 this type represents a nested type. For example, if this type is
@TA O<T>.I<S>
, return a representation of
@TA O<T>
.
Returns
null
for an
AnnotatedType
that is an instance
     of
