Class UndeclaredThrowableException
java.lang.Object
java.lang.Throwable
java.lang.Exception
java.lang.RuntimeException
java.lang.reflect.UndeclaredThrowableException
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
UndeclaredThrowableException
extends
RuntimeException
Thrown by a method invocation on a proxy instance if its invocation
 handler's
invoke
method throws a
 checked exception (a
Throwable
that is not assignable
 to
RuntimeException
or
Error
) that
 is not assignable to any of the exception types declared in the
throws
clause of the method that was invoked on the
 proxy instance and dispatched to the invocation handler.
An
UndeclaredThrowableException
instance contains
 the undeclared checked exception that was thrown by the invocation
 handler, and it can be retrieved with the
getUndeclaredThrowable()
method.
UndeclaredThrowableException
extends
RuntimeException
, so it is an unchecked exception
 that wraps a checked exception.
