public interface
AnnotatedType

AnnotatedType
represents the potentially annotated use of a type in
 the program currently running in this VM. The use may be of any type in the
 Java programming language, including an array type, a parameterized type, a
 type variable, or a wildcard type.

 Note that any annotations returned by methods on this interface are
type annotations
(JLS
9.7.4
) as the entity being
 potentially annotated is a type.

Method Details
getAnnotatedOwnerType
default
AnnotatedType
getAnnotatedOwnerType
()
Returns the potentially annotated type that this type is a member of, if
 this type represents a nested type. For example, if this type is
@TA O<T>.I<S>
, return a representation of
@TA O<T>
.
Returns
null
if this
AnnotatedType
represents a
     top-level class or interface, or a local or anonymous class, or
     a primitive type, or void.
Returns
null
if this
AnnotatedType
is an instance of
AnnotatedArrayType
,
AnnotatedTypeVariable
, or
AnnotatedWildcardType
.
Implementation Requirements:
This default implementation returns
null
and performs no other
 action.
Returns:
an
AnnotatedType
object representing the potentially
     annotated type that this type is a member of, or
null
Throws:
TypeNotPresentException
- if the owner type
     refers to a non-existent class or interface declaration
MalformedParameterizedTypeException
- if the owner type
     refers to a parameterized type that cannot be instantiated
     for any reason
Since:
9
getType
Type
getType
()
Returns the underlying type that this annotated type represents.
Returns:
the type this annotated type represents
getAnnotation
<T extends
Annotation
>
T
getAnnotation
(
Class
<T> annotationClass)
Returns this element's annotation for the specified type if
 such an annotation is
present
, else null.
Note that any annotation returned by this method is a type
 annotation.
Specified by:
getAnnotation
in interface
AnnotatedElement
Type Parameters:
T
- the type of the annotation to query for and return if present
Parameters:
annotationClass
- the Class object corresponding to the
        annotation type
Returns:
this element's annotation for the specified annotation type if
     present on this element, else null
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if the given annotation class is null
getAnnotations
Annotation
[]
getAnnotations
()
Returns annotations that are
present
on this element.

 If there are no annotations
present
on this element, the return
 value is an array of length 0.

 The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
 have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.
Note that any annotations returned by this method are type
 annotations.
Specified by:
getAnnotations
in interface
AnnotatedElement
Returns:
annotations present on this element
getDeclaredAnnotations
Annotation
[]
getDeclaredAnnotations
()
Returns annotations that are
directly present
on this element.
 This method ignores inherited annotations.

 If there are no annotations
directly present
on this element,
 the return value is an array of length 0.

 The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
 have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.
Note that any annotations returned by this method are type
 annotations.
Specified by:
getDeclaredAnnotations
in interface
AnnotatedElement
Returns:
annotations directly present on this element
