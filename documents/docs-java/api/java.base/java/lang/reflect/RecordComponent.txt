Method Details
getName
public
String
getName
()
Returns the name of this record component.
Returns:
the name of this record component
getType
public
Class
<?>
getType
()
Returns a
Class
that identifies the declared type for this
 record component.
Returns:
a
Class
identifying the declared type of the component
 represented by this record component
getGenericSignature
public
String
getGenericSignature
()
Returns a
String
that describes the generic type signature for
 this record component.
Returns:
a
String
that describes the generic type signature for
 this record component
See
Java Virtual Machine Specification
:
4.7.9.1 Signatures
getGenericType
public
Type
getGenericType
()
Returns a
Type
object that represents the declared type for
 this record component.
If the declared type of the record component is a parameterized type,
 the
Type
object returned reflects the actual type arguments used
 in the source code.
If the type of the underlying record component is a type variable or a
 parameterized type, it is created. Otherwise, it is resolved.
Returns:
a
Type
object that represents the declared type for
         this record component
Throws:
GenericSignatureFormatError
- if the generic record component
         signature does not conform to the format specified in
The Java Virtual Machine Specification
TypeNotPresentException
- if the generic type
         signature of the underlying record component refers to a non-existent
         type declaration
MalformedParameterizedTypeException
- if the generic
         signature of the underlying record component refers to a parameterized
         type that cannot be instantiated for any reason
getAnnotatedType
public
AnnotatedType
getAnnotatedType
()
Returns an
AnnotatedType
object that represents the use of a type to specify
 the declared type of this record component.
Returns:
an object representing the declared type of this record component
getAccessor
public
Method
getAccessor
()
Returns a
Method
that represents the accessor for this record
 component.
Returns:
a
Method
that represents the accessor for this record
 component
getAnnotation
public

Annotation
>
T
getAnnotation
(
Class
<T> annotationClass)
Returns this element's annotation for the specified type if
 such an annotation is
present
, else null.
Note that any annotation returned by this method is a
 declaration annotation.
Specified by:
getAnnotation
in interface
AnnotatedElement
Type Parameters:
T
- the type of the annotation to query for and return if present
Parameters:
annotationClass
- the Class object corresponding to the
        annotation type
Returns:
this element's annotation for the specified annotation type if
     present on this element, else null
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if the given annotation class is null
getAnnotations
public
Annotation
[]
getAnnotations
()
Returns annotations that are
present
on this element.

 If there are no annotations
present
on this element, the return
 value is an array of length 0.

 The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
 have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.
Note that any annotations returned by this method are
 declaration annotations.
Specified by:
getAnnotations
in interface
AnnotatedElement
Returns:
annotations present on this element
getDeclaredAnnotations
public
Annotation
[]
getDeclaredAnnotations
()
Returns annotations that are
directly present
on this element.
 This method ignores inherited annotations.

 If there are no annotations
directly present
on this element,
 the return value is an array of length 0.

 The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
 have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.
Note that any annotations returned by this method are
 declaration annotations.
Specified by:
getDeclaredAnnotations
in interface
AnnotatedElement
Returns:
annotations directly present on this element
toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns a string describing this record component. The format is
 the record component type, followed by a space, followed by the name
 of the record component.
 For example:
java.lang.String name
    int age
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
a string describing this record component
getDeclaringRecord
public
Class
<?>
getDeclaringRecord
()
Returns the record class which declares this record component.
Returns:
The record class declaring this record component.
