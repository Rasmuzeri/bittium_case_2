extends

Proxy
provides static methods for creating objects that act like instances
 of interfaces but allow for customized method invocation.
 To create a proxy instance for some interface
Foo
:
InvocationHandler handler = new MyInvocationHandler(...);
     Foo f = (Foo) Proxy.newProxyInstance(Foo.class.getClassLoader(),
                                          new Class<?>[] { Foo.class },
                                          handler);
A
proxy class
is a class created at runtime that implements a specified
 list of interfaces, known as
proxy interfaces
. A
proxy instance
is an instance of a proxy class.

 Each proxy instance has an associated
invocation handler
object, which implements the interface
InvocationHandler
.
 A method invocation on a proxy instance through one of its proxy
 interfaces will be dispatched to the
invoke
method of the instance's invocation handler, passing the proxy
 instance, a
java.lang.reflect.Method
object identifying
 the method that was invoked, and an array of type
Object
containing the arguments.  The invocation handler processes the
 encoded method invocation as appropriate and the result that it
 returns will be returned as the result of the method invocation on
 the proxy instance.
A proxy class has the following properties:
The unqualified name of a proxy class is unspecified.  The space
 of class names that begin with the string
"$Proxy"
should be, however, reserved for proxy classes.
The package and module in which a proxy class is defined is specified
below
.
A proxy class is
final and non-abstract
.
A proxy class extends
java.lang.reflect.Proxy
.
A proxy class implements exactly the interfaces specified at its
 creation, in the same order. Invoking
getInterfaces
on its
Class
object will return an array containing the same
 list of interfaces (in the order specified at its creation), invoking
getMethods
on its
Class
object will return
 an array of
Method
objects that include all of the
 methods in those interfaces, and invoking
getMethod
will
 find methods in the proxy interfaces as would be expected.
The
ProtectionDomain
of a proxy class
 is the same as that of system classes loaded by the bootstrap class
 loader, such as
java.lang.Object
, because the code for a
 proxy class is generated by trusted system code.  This protection
 domain will typically be granted
java.security.AllPermission
.
The
Proxy.isProxyClass
method can be used
 to determine if a given class is a proxy class.
A proxy instance has the following properties:
Given a proxy instance
proxy
and one of the
 interfaces,
Foo
, implemented by its proxy class, the
 following expression will return true:
proxy instanceof Foo
and the following cast operation will succeed (rather than throwing
 a
ClassCastException
):
(Foo) proxy
Each proxy instance has an associated invocation handler, the one
 that was passed to its constructor.  The static
Proxy.getInvocationHandler
method
 will return the invocation handler associated with the proxy instance
 passed as its argument.
An interface method invocation on a proxy instance will be
 encoded and dispatched to the invocation handler's
invoke
method as described in the
 documentation for that method.
A proxy interface may define a default method or inherit
 a default method from its superinterface directly or indirectly.
 An invocation handler can invoke a default method of a proxy interface
 by calling
InvocationHandler::invokeDefault
.
An invocation of the
hashCode
,
equals
, or
toString
methods declared in
java.lang.Object
on a proxy instance will be encoded and
 dispatched to the invocation handler's
invoke
method in
 the same manner as interface method invocations are encoded and
 dispatched, as described above.  The declaring class of the
Method
object passed to
invoke
will be
java.lang.Object
.  Other public methods of a proxy
 instance inherited from
java.lang.Object
are not
 overridden by a proxy class, so invocations of those methods behave
 like they do for instances of
java.lang.Object
.
Package and Module Membership of Proxy Class
The package and module to which a proxy class belongs are chosen such that
 the accessibility of the proxy class is in line with the accessibility of
 the proxy interfaces. Specifically, the package and the module membership
 of a proxy class defined via the
getProxyClass(ClassLoader, Class[])
or
newProxyInstance(ClassLoader, Class[], InvocationHandler)
methods is specified as follows:
If all the proxy interfaces are in
exported
or
open
packages:
if all the proxy interfaces are
public
, then the proxy class is
public
in an unconditionally exported but non-open package.
     The name of the package and the module are unspecified.
if at least one of all the proxy interfaces is
non-public
, then
     the proxy class is
non-public
in the package and module of the
     non-public interfaces. All the non-public interfaces must be in the same
     package and module; otherwise, proxying them is
not possible
.
If at least one proxy interface is in a package that is
non-exported
and
non-open
:
if all the proxy interfaces are
public
, then the proxy class is
public
in a
non-exported
,
non-open
package of
dynamic module
.
The names of the package and the module are unspecified.
if at least one of all the proxy interfaces is
non-public
, then
     the proxy class is
non-public
in the package and module of the
     non-public interfaces. All the non-public interfaces must be in the same
     package and module; otherwise, proxying them is
not possible
.
Note that if proxy interfaces with a mix of accessibilities -- for example,
 an exported public interface and a non-exported non-public interface -- are
 proxied by the same instance, then the proxy class's accessibility is
 governed by the least accessible proxy interface.
Note that it is possible for arbitrary code to obtain access to a proxy class
 in an open package with
setAccessible
,
 whereas a proxy class in a non-open package is never accessible to
 code outside the module of the proxy class.
Throughout this specification, a "non-exported package" refers to a package
 that is not exported to all modules, and a "non-open package" refers to
 a package that is not open to all modules.  Specifically, these terms refer to
 a package that either is not exported/open by its containing module or is
 exported/open in a qualified fashion by its containing module.
Dynamic Modules
A dynamic module is a named module generated at runtime. A proxy class
 defined in a dynamic module is encapsulated and not accessible to any module.
 Calling
Constructor.newInstance(Object...)
on a proxy class in
 a dynamic module will throw
IllegalAccessException
;
Proxy.newProxyInstance
method should be used instead.
A dynamic module can read the modules of all of the superinterfaces of a proxy
 class and the modules of the classes and interfaces referenced by
 all public method signatures of a proxy class.  If a superinterface or
 a referenced class or interface, say
T
, is in a non-exported package,
 the
module
of
T
is updated to export the
 package of
T
to the dynamic module.
Methods Duplicated in Multiple Proxy Interfaces
When two or more proxy interfaces contain a method with
 the same name and parameter signature, the order of the proxy class's
 interfaces becomes significant.  When such a
duplicate method
is invoked on a proxy instance, the
Method
object passed
 to the invocation handler will not necessarily be the one whose
 declaring class is assignable from the reference type of the interface
 that the proxy's method was invoked through.  This limitation exists
 because the corresponding method implementation in the generated proxy
 class cannot determine which interface it was invoked through.
 Therefore, when a duplicate method is invoked on a proxy instance,
 the
Method
object for the method in the foremost interface
 that contains the method (either directly or inherited through a
 superinterface) in the proxy class's list of interfaces is passed to
 the invocation handler's
invoke
method, regardless of the
 reference type through which the method invocation occurred.
If a proxy interface contains a method with the same name and
 parameter signature as the
hashCode
,
equals
,
 or
toString
methods of
java.lang.Object
,
 when such a method is invoked on a proxy instance, the
Method
object passed to the invocation handler will have
java.lang.Object
as its declaring class.  In other words,
 the public, non-final methods of
java.lang.Object
logically precede all of the proxy interfaces for the determination of
 which
Method
object to pass to the invocation handler.
Note also that when a duplicate method is dispatched to an
 invocation handler, the
invoke
method may only throw
 checked exception types that are assignable to one of the exception
 types in the
throws
clause of the method in
all
of
 the proxy interfaces that it can be invoked through.  If the
invoke
method throws a checked exception that is not
 assignable to any of the exception types declared by the method in one
 of the proxy interfaces that it can be invoked through, then an
 unchecked
UndeclaredThrowableException
will be thrown by
 the invocation on the proxy instance.  This restriction means that not
 all of the exception types returned by invoking
getExceptionTypes
on the
Method
object
 passed to the
invoke
method can necessarily be thrown
 successfully by the
invoke
method.

Constructor.newInstance
will throw
IllegalAccessException
when it is called on
      an inaccessible proxy class.
      Use
newProxyInstance(ClassLoader, Class[], InvocationHandler)
to create a proxy instance instead.
Returns the
java.lang.Class
object for a proxy class
 given a class loader and an array of interfaces.  The proxy class
 will be defined by the specified class loader and will implement
 all of the supplied interfaces.  If any of the given interfaces
 is non-public, the proxy class will be non-public. If a proxy class
 for the same permutation of interfaces has already been defined by the
 class loader, then the existing proxy class will be returned; otherwise,
 a proxy class for those interfaces will be generated dynamically
 and defined by the class loader.
Parameters:
loader
- the class loader to define the proxy class
interfaces
- the list of interfaces for the proxy class
          to implement
Returns:
a proxy class that is defined in the specified class loader

Returns a proxy instance for the specified interfaces
 that dispatches method invocations to the specified invocation
 handler.
IllegalArgumentException
will be thrown
 if any of the following restrictions is violated:
All of
Class
objects in the given
interfaces
array
 must represent
non-hidden
and
non-sealed
interfaces,
 not classes or primitive types.
No two elements in the
interfaces
array may
 refer to identical
Class
objects.
All of the interface types must be visible by name through the
 specified class loader. In other words, for class loader
cl
and every interface
i
, the following
 expression must be true:
Class.forName(i.getName(), false, cl) == i
All of the types referenced by all
 public method signatures of the specified interfaces
 and those inherited by their superinterfaces
 must be visible by name through the specified class loader.
All non-public interfaces must be in the same package
 and module, defined by the specified class loader and
 the module of the non-public interfaces can access all of
 the interface types; otherwise, it would not be possible for
 the proxy class to implement all of the interfaces,
 regardless of what package it is defined in.
For any set of member methods of the specified interfaces
 that have the same signature:
If the return type of any of the methods is a primitive
 type or void, then all of the methods must have that same
 return type.
Otherwise, one of the methods must have a return type that
 is assignable to all of the return types of the rest of the
 methods.
The resulting proxy class must not exceed any limits imposed
 on classes by the virtual machine.  For example, the VM may limit
 the number of interfaces that a class may implement to 65535; in
 that case, the size of the
interfaces
array must not
 exceed 65535.
Note that the order of the specified proxy interfaces is
 significant: two requests for a proxy class with the same combination
 of interfaces but in a different order will result in two distinct
 proxy classes.
Parameters:
loader
- the class loader to define the proxy class
interfaces
- the list of interfaces for the proxy class
          to implement
