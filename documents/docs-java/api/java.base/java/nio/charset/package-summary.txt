Package java.nio.charset
package
java.nio.charset
Defines charsets, decoders, and encoders, for translating between
 bytes and Unicode characters.
Summary of charsets, decoders, and encoders in this package
Class name
Description
Charset
A named mapping between characters and bytes
CharsetDecoder
Decodes bytes into characters
CharsetEncoder
Encodes characters into bytes
CoderResult
Describes coder results
CodingErrorAction
Describes actions to take when coding errors are detected
A
charset
is named mapping between sequences of
 sixteen-bit Unicode characters and sequences of bytes, in the sense
 defined in
RFC 2278
.
 A
decoder
is an engine which transforms bytes in a specific
 charset into characters, and an
encoder
is an engine which
 transforms characters into bytes.  Encoders and decoders operate on
 byte and character buffers.  They are collectively referred to as
coders
.
The
Charset
class defines methods for
 creating coders for a given charset and for retrieving the various
 names associated with a charset.  It also defines static methods
 for testing whether a particular charset is supported, for locating
 charset instances by name, and for constructing a map that contains
 every charset for which support is available in the current Java
 virtual machine.
Most users will not use these classes directly; instead they
 will use the existing charset-related constructors and methods in
 the
String
class, together with the existing
InputStreamReader
and
OutputStreamWriter
classes, all of whose implementations
 have been reworked to make use of the charset facilities defined in
 this package.  A small number of changes have been made to the
InputStreamReader
and
OutputStreamWriter
classes in order to allow explicit
 charset objects to be specified in the construction of instances of
 those classes.
Support for new charsets can be made available via the
 interface defined in the
CharsetProvider
class in the
java.nio.charset.spi
package.
Unless otherwise noted, passing a
null
argument to a
 constructor or method in any class or interface in this package
 will cause a
NullPointerException
to be thrown.

code units
and sequences of
 bytes.
CharsetDecoder

 sixteen-bit Unicode characters.
CharsetEncoder
An engine that can transform a sequence of sixteen-bit Unicode characters into a sequence of
 bytes in a specific charset.
CoderMalfunctionError

, throws an unexpected
 exception.

IllegalCharsetNameException
Unchecked exception thrown when a string that is not a
legal charset name
is used as such.
MalformedInputException
Checked exception thrown when an input byte sequence is not legal for given
 charset, or an input character sequence is not a legal sixteen-bit Unicode
 sequence.
StandardCharsets
Constant definitions for the standard
charsets
.
UnmappableCharacterException
Checked exception thrown when an input character (or byte) sequence
 is valid but cannot be mapped to an output byte (or character)
 sequence.
UnsupportedCharsetException
Unchecked exception thrown when no support is available
 for a requested charset.
