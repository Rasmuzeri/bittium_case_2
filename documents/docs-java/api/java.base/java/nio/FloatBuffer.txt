public abstract sealed class
FloatBuffer
extends
Buffer

A float buffer.
This class defines four categories of operations upon
 float buffers:
Absolute and relative
get
and
put
methods that read and write
   single floats;
Absolute and relative
bulk get
methods that transfer contiguous sequences of floats from this buffer
   into an array;
Absolute and relative
bulk put
methods that transfer contiguous sequences of floats from a
   float array or some other float
   buffer into this buffer;
A method for
compacting
a float buffer.
Float buffers can be created either by
allocation
, which allocates space for the buffer's








 content, by
wrapping
an existing
 float array  into a buffer, or by creating a
view
of an existing byte buffer.
Like a byte buffer, a float buffer is either
direct
or
non-direct
.  A
 float buffer created via the
wrap
methods of this class will
 be non-direct.  A float buffer created as a view of a byte buffer will
 be direct if, and only if, the byte buffer itself is direct.  Whether or not
 a float buffer is direct may be determined by invoking the
isDirect
method.
Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are
 specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked.  This allows
 method invocations to be chained.
Optional operations
Methods specified as
optional
 operations
throw a
ReadOnlyBufferException
when invoked
 on a
read-only
FloatBuffer. The
 methods
array
and
arrayOffset
throw an
UnsupportedOperationException
if the FloatBuffer is
 not backed by an
accessible float array
(irrespective of whether the FloatBuffer is read-only).

FloatBuffer
wrap
(float[] array,
 int offset,
 int length)
Wraps a float array into a buffer.
The new buffer will be backed by the given float array;
 that is, modifications to the buffer will cause the array to be modified
 and vice versa.  The new buffer's capacity will be
array.length
, its position will be
offset
, its limit
 will be
offset + length
, its mark will be undefined, and its
 byte order will be



 the
native order
of the underlying
 hardware.

 Its
backing array
will be the given array, and
 its
array offset
will be zero.
Parameters:
array
- The array that will back the new buffer
offset
- The offset of the subarray to be used; must be non-negative and
         no larger than
array.length
.  The new buffer's position
         will be set to this value.

slice
public abstract
FloatBuffer
slice
()
Creates a new float buffer whose content is a shared subsequence of
 this buffer's content.
The content of the new buffer will start at this buffer's current
 position.  Changes to this buffer's content will be visible in the new
 buffer, and vice versa; the two buffers' position, limit, and mark
 values will be independent.
The new buffer's position will be zero, its capacity and its limit
 will be the number of floats remaining in this buffer, its mark will be
 undefined, and its byte order will be



 identical to that of this buffer.

public abstract
FloatBuffer
slice
(int index,
 int length)
Creates a new float buffer whose content is a shared subsequence of
 this buffer's content.
The content of the new buffer will start at position
index
in this buffer, and will contain
length
elements. Changes to
 this buffer's content will be visible in the new buffer, and vice versa;
 the two buffers' position, limit, and mark values will be independent.
The new buffer's position will be zero, its capacity and its limit
 will be
length
, its mark will be undefined, and its byte order
 will be



 identical to that of this buffer.

 The new buffer will be direct if, and only if, this buffer is direct,
 and it will be read-only if, and only if, this buffer is read-only.
Specified by:

Buffer
Parameters:
index
- The position in this buffer at which the content of the new
          buffer will start; must be non-negative and no larger than
limit()
length
- The number of elements the new buffer will contain; must be
          non-negative and no larger than
limit() - index
Returns:
The new buffer
Throws:

public abstract
FloatBuffer
duplicate
()
Creates a new float buffer that shares this buffer's content.
The content of the new buffer will be that of this buffer.  Changes
 to this buffer's content will be visible in the new buffer, and vice
 versa; the two buffers' position, limit, and mark values will be
 independent.
The new buffer's capacity, limit, position,




 mark values, and byte order will be identical to those of this buffer.

 The new buffer will be direct if, and only if, this buffer is direct, and
 it will be read-only if, and only if, this buffer is read-only.

asReadOnlyBuffer
public abstract
FloatBuffer
asReadOnlyBuffer
()
Creates a new, read-only float buffer that shares this buffer's
 content.
The content of the new buffer will be that of this buffer.  Changes
 to this buffer's content will be visible in the new buffer; the new
 buffer itself, however, will be read-only and will not allow the shared
 content to be modified.  The two buffers' position, limit, and mark
 values will be independent.
The new buffer's capacity, limit, position,




 mark values, and byte order will be identical to those of this buffer.
If this buffer is itself read-only then this method behaves in
 exactly the same way as the
duplicate
method.
Returns:
The new, read-only float buffer

()
Relative
get
method.  Reads the float at this buffer's

public
FloatBuffer
get
(float[] dst,
 int offset,
 int length)
Relative bulk
get
method.
This method transfers floats from this buffer into the given
 destination array.  If there are fewer floats remaining in the
 buffer than are required to satisfy the request, that is, if
length
>
remaining()
, then no
 floats are transferred and a
BufferUnderflowException
is
 thrown.
Otherwise, this method copies
length
floats from this
 buffer into the given array, starting at the current position of this
 buffer and at the given offset in the array.  The position of this
 buffer is then incremented by
length
.
In other words, an invocation of this method of the form
src.get(dst, off, len)
has exactly the same effect as
 the loop
Copy
for (int i = off; i < off + len; i++)
        dst[i] = src.get();
except that it first checks that there are sufficient floats in
 this buffer and it is potentially much more efficient.
Parameters:
dst
- The array into which floats are to be written
offset
- The offset within the array of the first float to be
         written; must be non-negative and no larger than
dst.length
length
- The maximum number of floats to be written to the given
         array; must be non-negative and no larger than
dst.length - offset
Returns:
This buffer
Throws:
BufferUnderflowException
- If there are fewer than
length

method.
This method transfers
length
floats from this
 buffer into the given array, starting at the given index in this
 buffer and at the given offset in the array.  The position of this
 buffer is unchanged.
An invocation of this method of the form
src.get(index, dst, offset, length)
has exactly the same effect as the following loop except that it first
 checks the consistency of the supplied parameters and it is potentially
 much more efficient:
Copy
for (int i = offset, j = index; i < offset + length; i++, j++)
        dst[i] = src.get(j);
Parameters:
index
- The index in this buffer from which the first float will be
         read; must be non-negative and less than
limit()
dst
- The destination array
offset
- The offset within the array of the first float to be
         written; must be non-negative and less than
dst.length
length
- The number of floats to be written to the given array;
         must be non-negative and no larger than the smaller of
limit() - index
and
dst.length - offset

 invocation of this method of the form
src.get(index, dst)
behaves in exactly the same
 way as the invocation:

- The index in this buffer from which the first float will be
         read; must be non-negative and less than

- The destination array
Returns:

.
This method transfers the floats remaining in the given source
 buffer into this buffer.  If there are more floats remaining in the
 source buffer than in this buffer, that is, if
src.remaining()
>
remaining()
,
 then no floats are transferred and a
BufferOverflowException
is thrown.
Otherwise, this method copies
n
=
src.remaining()
floats from the given
 buffer into this buffer, starting at each buffer's current position.
 The positions of both buffers are then incremented by
n
.
In other words, an invocation of this method of the form
dst.put(src)
has exactly the same effect as the loop
Copy
while (src.hasRemaining())
        dst.put(src.get());
except that it first checks that there is sufficient space in this
 buffer and it is potentially much more efficient.  If this buffer and
 the source buffer share the same backing array or memory, then the
 result will be as if the source elements were first copied to an
 intermediate location before being written into this buffer.
Parameters:
src
- The source buffer from which floats are to be read;
         must not be this buffer
Returns:
This buffer
Throws:
BufferOverflowException
- If there is insufficient space in this buffer

 source buffer and the given
index
in this buffer. The positions
 of both buffers are unchanged.
In other words, an invocation of this method of the form
dst.put(index, src, offset, length)
has exactly the same effect as the loop
Copy
for (int i = offset, j = index; i < offset + length; i++, j++)
        dst.put(j, src.get(i));
except that it first checks the consistency of the supplied parameters
 and it is potentially much more efficient.  If this buffer and
 the source buffer share the same backing array or memory, then the
 result will be as if the source elements were first copied to an
 intermediate location before being written into this buffer.
Parameters:
index
- The index in this buffer at which the first float will be
        written; must be non-negative and less than
limit()
src
- The buffer from which floats are to be read

Absolute bulk
put
method
(optional operation)
.
This method copies floats into this buffer from the given source
 array.  The position of this buffer is unchanged.  An invocation of this
 method of the form
dst.put(index, src)
behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation:
Copy
dst.put(index, src, 0, src.length);
Parameters:
index
- The index in this buffer at which the first float will be
         written; must be non-negative and less than
limit()
src
- The array from which floats are to be read
Returns:
This buffer
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- If
index
is negative, not smaller than
limit()
,
          or
limit() - index < src.length
ReadOnlyBufferException
- If this buffer is read-only
Since:

hasArray
public final
boolean
hasArray
()

then the
array
and
arrayOffset
methods may safely be invoked.
Specified by:
hasArray
in class
Buffer
Returns:
true
if, and only if, this buffer
          is backed by an array and is not read-only
array
public final
float[]
array
()
Returns the float array that backs this
 buffer
(optional operation)
.
Modifications to this buffer's content will cause the returned
 array's content to be modified, and vice versa.
Invoke the
hasArray
method before invoking this
 method in order to ensure that this buffer has an accessible backing
 array.
Specified by:
array
in class
Buffer
Returns:
The array that backs this buffer
Throws:
ReadOnlyBufferException
- If this buffer is backed by an array but is read-only
UnsupportedOperationException
- If this buffer is not backed by an accessible array
arrayOffset
public final
int
arrayOffset
()

 element of the buffer
(optional operation)
.
If this buffer is backed by an array then buffer position
p
corresponds to array index
p
+
arrayOffset()
.
Invoke the
hasArray
method before invoking this
 method in order to ensure that this buffer has an accessible backing
 array.
Specified by:

- If this buffer is not backed by an accessible array
position
public final
FloatBuffer
position
(int newPosition)
Sets this buffer's position.  If the mark is defined and larger than the
 new position then it is discarded.
Overrides:
position
in class
Buffer
Parameters:
newPosition
- The new position value; must be non-negative
         and no larger than the current limit
Returns:
This buffer
Since:
9
limit
public final
FloatBuffer
limit
(int newLimit)
Sets this buffer's limit.  If the position is larger than the new limit
 then it is set to the new limit.  If the mark is defined and larger than
 the new limit then it is discarded.
Overrides:
limit
in class
Buffer
Parameters:
newLimit
- The new limit value; must be non-negative
         and no larger than this buffer's capacity
Returns:

mark
public final
FloatBuffer
mark
()
Sets this buffer's mark at its position.
Overrides:
mark
in class
Buffer
Returns:
This buffer
Since:
9
reset
public final
FloatBuffer
reset
()
Resets this buffer's position to the previously-marked position.
Invoking this method neither changes nor discards the mark's
 value.
Overrides:
reset
in class
Buffer
Returns:
This buffer
Since:
9
clear
public final
FloatBuffer
clear
()
Clears this buffer.  The position is set to zero, the limit is set to
 the capacity, and the mark is discarded.
Invoke this method before using a sequence of channel-read or
put
operations to fill this buffer.  For example:
Copy
buf.clear();     // Prepare buffer for reading
    in.read(buf);    // Read data
This method does not actually erase the data in the buffer, but it
 is named as if it did because it will most often be used in situations
 in which that might as well be the case.
Overrides:
clear
in class
Buffer
Returns:
This buffer
Since:
9
flip
public final
FloatBuffer
flip
()
Flips this buffer.  The limit is set to the current position and then
 the position is set to zero.  If the mark is defined then it is
 discarded.
After a sequence of channel-read or
put
operations, invoke
 this method to prepare for a sequence of channel-write or relative
get
operations.  For example:
Copy
buf.put(magic);    // Prepend header
    in.read(buf);      // Read data into rest of buffer
    buf.flip();        // Flip buffer
    out.write(buf);    // Write header + data to channel
This method is often used in conjunction with the
compact
method when transferring data from
 one place to another.
Overrides:
flip
in class
Buffer
Returns:
This buffer
Since:
9
rewind
public final
FloatBuffer
rewind
()
Rewinds this buffer.  The position is set to zero and the mark is
 discarded.
Invoke this method before a sequence of channel-write or
get
operations, assuming that the limit has already been set
 appropriately.  For example:
Copy
out.write(buf);    // Write remaining data
    buf.rewind();      // Rewind buffer
    buf.get(array);    // Copy data into array
Overrides:
rewind
in class
Buffer
Returns:
This buffer
Since:
9
compact
public abstract
FloatBuffer
compact
()
Compacts this buffer
(optional operation)
.
The floats between the buffer's current position and its limit,
 if any, are copied to the beginning of the buffer.  That is, the
 float at index
p
=
position()
is copied
 to index zero, the float at index
p
+ 1 is copied
 to index one, and so forth until the float at index
limit()
- 1 is copied to index
n
=
limit()
-
1
-
p
.
 The buffer's position is then set to
n+1
and its limit is set to
 its capacity.  The mark, if defined, is discarded.
The buffer's position is set to the number of floats copied,
 rather than to zero, so that an invocation of this method can be
 followed immediately by an invocation of another relative
put
method.
Returns:
This buffer
Throws:
ReadOnlyBufferException
- If this buffer is read-only
isDirect
public abstract
boolean
isDirect
()
Tells whether or not this float buffer is direct.
Specified by:
isDirect
in class
Buffer
Returns:
true
if, and only if, this buffer is direct
toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns a string summarizing the state of this buffer.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
A summary string
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Returns the current hash code of this buffer.
The hash code of a float buffer depends only upon its remaining
 elements; that is, upon the elements from
position()
up to, and
 including, the element at
limit()
-
1
.
Because buffer hash codes are content-dependent, it is inadvisable
 to use buffers as keys in hash maps or similar data structures unless it
 is known that their contents will not change.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
The current hash code of this buffer
See Also:
Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
ob)
Tells whether or not this buffer is equal to another object.
Two float buffers are equal if, and only if,
They have the same element type,
They have the same number of remaining elements, and
The two sequences of remaining elements, considered
   independently of their starting positions, are pointwise equal.

   This method considers two float elements
a
and
b
to be equal if
(a == b) || (Float.isNaN(a) && Float.isNaN(b))
.
   The values
-0.0
and
+0.0
are considered to be
   equal, unlike
Float.equals(Object)
.
A float buffer is not equal to any other type of object.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
ob
- The object to which this buffer is to be compared
Returns:
true
if, and only if, this buffer is equal to the
           given object
See Also:
Object.hashCode()
HashMap
compareTo
public
int
compareTo
(
FloatBuffer
that)
Compares this buffer to another.
Two float buffers are compared by comparing their sequences of
 remaining elements lexicographically, without regard to the starting
 position of each sequence within its corresponding buffer.

 Pairs of
float
elements are compared as if by invoking
Float.compare(float,float)
, except that
-0.0
and
0.0
are considered to be equal.
Float.NaN
is considered by this method to be equal
 to itself and greater than all other
float
values
 (including
Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY
).
A float buffer is not comparable to any other type of object.
Specified by:
compareTo
in interface
Comparable
<
FloatBuffer
>
Parameters:
that
- the object to be compared.
Returns:
A negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this buffer
          is less than, equal to, or greater than the given buffer
mismatch
public
int
mismatch
(
FloatBuffer
that)
Finds and returns the relative index of the first mismatch between this
 buffer and a given buffer.  The index is relative to the
position
of each buffer and will be in the range of
 0 (inclusive) up to the smaller of the
remaining
elements in each buffer (exclusive).
If the two buffers share a common prefix then the returned index is
 the length of the common prefix and it follows that there is a mismatch
 between the two buffers at that index within the respective buffers.
 If one buffer is a proper prefix of the other then the returned index is
 the smaller of the remaining elements in each buffer, and it follows that
 the index is only valid for the buffer with the larger number of
 remaining elements.
 Otherwise, there is no mismatch.
Parameters:
that
- The byte buffer to be tested for a mismatch with this buffer
Returns:
The relative index of the first mismatch between this and the
          given buffer, otherwise -1 if no mismatch.
Since:
11
order
public abstract
ByteOrder
order
()
Retrieves this buffer's byte order.
The byte order of a float buffer created by allocation or by
 wrapping an existing
float
array is the
native order
of the underlying
 hardware.  The byte order of a float buffer created as a
view
of a byte buffer is that of the
 byte buffer at the moment that the view is created.
Returns:
This buffer's byte order
