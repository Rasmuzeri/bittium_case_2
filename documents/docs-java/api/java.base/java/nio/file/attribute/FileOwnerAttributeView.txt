FileAttributeView
A file attribute view that supports reading or updating the owner of a file.
 This file attribute view is intended for file system implementations that
 support a file attribute that represents an identity that is the owner of
 the file. Often the owner of a file is the identity of the entity that
 created the file.
The
getOwner
or
setOwner
methods may
 be used to read or update the owner of the file.
The
getAttribute
and
setAttribute
methods may also be
 used to read or update the owner. In that case, the owner attribute is
 identified by the name
"owner"
, and the value of the attribute is
 a
UserPrincipal
.
Since:
1.7

 across platforms it is recommended that this method should only be used
 to set the file owner to a user principal that is not a group.
Parameters:

owner

          group and this implementation does not support setting the owner
          to a group

          installed, and it denies
