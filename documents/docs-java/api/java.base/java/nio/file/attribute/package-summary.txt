package
java.nio.file.attribute
Interfaces and classes providing access to file and file system attributes.
Attribute views
Attribute views
Description
AttributeView
Can read or update non-opaque values associated with objects in a file system
FileAttributeView
Can read or update file attributes
BasicFileAttributeView
Can read or update a basic set of file attributes
PosixFileAttributeView
Can read or update POSIX defined file attributes
DosFileAttributeView
Can read or update FAT file attributes
FileOwnerAttributeView
Can read or update the owner of a file
AclFileAttributeView
Can read or update Access Control Lists
UserDefinedFileAttributeView
Can read or update user-defined file attributes
FileStoreAttributeView
Can read or update file system attributes
An attribute view provides a read-only or updatable view of the non-opaque
 values, or
metadata
, associated with objects in a file system.
 The
FileAttributeView
interface is
 extended by several other interfaces that provide views to specific sets of file
 attributes.
FileAttributeViews
are selected by invoking the
Files.getFileAttributeView(java.nio.file.Path, java.lang.Class<V>, java.nio.file.LinkOption...)
method with a
type-token
to identify the required view. Views can also be identified
 by name. The
FileStoreAttributeView
interface
 provides access to file store attributes. A
FileStoreAttributeView
of
 a given type is obtained by invoking the
FileStore.getFileStoreAttributeView(java.lang.Class<V>)
method.
The
BasicFileAttributeView
class defines methods to read and update a
basic
set of file
 attributes that are common to many file systems.
The
PosixFileAttributeView
interface extends
BasicFileAttributeView
by defining methods
 to access the file attributes commonly used by file systems and operating systems
 that implement the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) family of
 standards.
The
DosFileAttributeView
class extends
BasicFileAttributeView
by defining methods to
 access the legacy "DOS" file attributes supported on file systems such as File
 Allocation Table (FAT), commonly used in consumer devices.
The
AclFileAttributeView
class defines methods to read and write the Access Control List (ACL)
 file attribute. The ACL model used by this file attribute view is based
 on the model defined by
RFC 3530: Network File System (NFS) version 4 Protocol
.
In addition to attribute views, this package also defines classes and
 interfaces that are used when accessing attributes:
The
UserPrincipal
and
GroupPrincipal
interfaces represent an
   identity or group identity.
The
UserPrincipalLookupService
interface defines methods to lookup user or group principals.
The
FileAttribute
interface
   represents the value of an attribute for cases where the attribute value is
   required to be set atomically when creating an object in the file system.
Unless otherwise noted, passing a
null
argument to a constructor
 or method in any class or interface in this package will cause a
NullPointerException
to be thrown.
