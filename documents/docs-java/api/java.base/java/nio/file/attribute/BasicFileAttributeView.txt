public interface
BasicFileAttributeView
extends
FileAttributeView
A file attribute view that provides a view of a
basic set
of file
 attributes common to many file systems. The basic set of file attributes
 consist of
mandatory
and
optional
file attributes as
 defined by the
BasicFileAttributes
interface.
The file attributes are retrieved from the file system as a
bulk
 operation
by invoking the
readAttributes
method.
 This class also defines the
setTimes
method to update the
 file's time attributes.
Where dynamic access to file attributes is required, the attributes
 supported by this attribute view have the following names and types:
Supported attributes
Name
Type
"lastModifiedTime"
FileTime
"lastAccessTime"
FileTime
"creationTime"
FileTime
"size"
Long
"isRegularFile"
Boolean
"isDirectory"
Boolean
"isSymbolicLink"
Boolean
"isOther"
Boolean
"fileKey"
Object
The
getAttribute
method may be
 used to read any of these attributes as if by invoking the
readAttributes()
method.
The
setAttribute
method may be
 used to update the file's last modified time, last access time or create time
 attributes as if by invoking the
setTimes
method.

Reads the basic file attributes as a bulk operation.
It is implementation specific if all file attributes are read as an
 atomic operation with respect to other file system operations.
Returns:
the file attributes
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs
SecurityException
- In the case of the default provider, a security manager is
          installed, its
checkRead
method is invoked to check read access to the file

throws
IOException
Updates any or all of the file's last modified time, last access time,
 and create time attributes.
This method updates the file's timestamp attributes. The values are
 converted to the epoch and precision supported by the file system.
 Converting from finer to coarser granularities results in precision loss.
 The behavior of this method when attempting to set a timestamp that is
 not supported or to a value that is outside the range supported by the
 underlying file store is not defined. It may or not fail by throwing an
IOException
.
If any of the
lastModifiedTime
,
lastAccessTime
,
 or
createTime
parameters has the value
null
then the
 corresponding timestamp is not changed. An implementation may require to
 read the existing values of the file attributes when only some, but not
 all, of the timestamp attributes are updated. Consequently, this method
 may not be an atomic operation with respect to other file system
 operations. Reading and re-writing existing values may also result in
 precision loss. If all of the
lastModifiedTime
,
lastAccessTime
and
createTime
parameters are
null
then
 this method has no effect.
Usage Example:
Suppose we want to change a file's last access time.
Copy
Path path = ...
    FileTime time = ...
    Files.getFileAttributeView(path, BasicFileAttributeView.class).setTimes(null, time, null);
Parameters:
lastModifiedTime
- the new last modified time, or
null
to not change the
          value
lastAccessTime
- the last access time, or
null
to not change the value
createTime
- the file's create time, or
null
to not change the value
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs
SecurityException
- In the case of the default provider, a security manager is
          installed, its
checkWrite
method is invoked to check write access to the file
