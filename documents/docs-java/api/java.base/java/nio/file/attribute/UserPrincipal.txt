UserPrincipal
extends
Principal
A
Principal
representing an identity used to determine access rights
 to objects in a file system.
On many platforms and file systems an entity requires appropriate access
 rights or permissions in order to access objects in a file system. The
 access rights are generally performed by checking the identity of the entity.
 For example, on implementations that use Access Control Lists (ACLs) to
 enforce privilege separation then a file in the file system may have an
 associated ACL that determines the access rights of identities specified in
 the ACL.
A
UserPrincipal
object is an abstract representation of an
 identity. It has a
name
that is typically the username or
 account name that it represents. User principal objects may be obtained using
 a
UserPrincipalLookupService
, or returned by
FileAttributeView
implementations that provide access to identity related
 attributes. For example, the
AclFileAttributeView
and
PosixFileAttributeView
provide access to a file's
owner
.
