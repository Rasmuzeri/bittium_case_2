Class UserPrincipalLookupService
java.lang.Object
java.nio.file.attribute.UserPrincipalLookupService
public abstract class
UserPrincipalLookupService
extends
Object
An object to lookup user and group principals by name. A
UserPrincipal
represents an identity that may be used to determine access rights to objects
 in a file system. A
GroupPrincipal
represents a
group identity
.
 A
UserPrincipalLookupService
defines methods to lookup identities by
 name or group name (which are typically user or account names). Whether names
 and group names are case sensitive or not depends on the implementation.
 The exact definition of a group is implementation specific but typically a
 group represents an identity created for administrative purposes so as to
 determine the access rights for the members of the group. In particular it is
 implementation specific if the
namespace
for names and groups is the
 same or is distinct. To ensure consistent and correct behavior across
 platforms it is recommended that this API be used as if the namespaces are
 distinct. In other words, the
lookupPrincipalByName
should be used to lookup users, and
lookupPrincipalByGroupName
should be used to
 lookup groups.

Method Details
lookupPrincipalByName
public abstract
UserPrincipal
lookupPrincipalByName
(
String
name)
throws
IOException
Lookup a user principal by name.
Parameters:
name
- the string representation of the user principal to lookup
Returns:
a user principal
Throws:
UserPrincipalNotFoundException
- the principal does not exist
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs
SecurityException
- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
          installed, it checks
RuntimePermission
("lookupUserInformation")
lookupPrincipalByGroupName
public abstract
GroupPrincipal
lookupPrincipalByGroupName
(
String
group)
throws
IOException
Lookup a group principal by group name.
Where an implementation does not support any notion of group then
 this method always throws
UserPrincipalNotFoundException
. Where
 the namespace for user accounts and groups is the same, then this method
 is identical to invoking
lookupPrincipalByName
.
Parameters:
group
- the string representation of the group to lookup
Returns:
a group principal
Throws:
UserPrincipalNotFoundException
- the principal does not exist or is not a group
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs
SecurityException
- In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
          installed, it checks
RuntimePermission
("lookupUserInformation")
