Class AclEntry
java.lang.Object
java.nio.file.attribute.AclEntry
public final class
AclEntry
extends
Object
An entry in an access control list (ACL).
The ACL entry represented by this class is based on the ACL model
 specified in
RFC 3530:
 Network File System (NFS) version 4 Protocol
. Each entry has four
 components as follows:
The
type
component determines if the entry
    grants or denies access.
The
principal
component, sometimes called the
    "who" component, is a
UserPrincipal
corresponding to the identity
    that the entry grants or denies access
The
permissions
component is a set of
permissions
The
flags
component is a set of
flags
to indicate how entries are inherited and propagated
ACL entries are created using an associated
AclEntry.Builder
object by
 invoking its
build
method.
ACL entries are immutable and are safe for use by multiple concurrent
 threads.

AclEntry.Builder
newBuilder
()
Constructs a new builder. The initial value of the type and who
 components is
null
. The initial value of the permissions and
 flags components is the empty set.
Returns:
a new builder

equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
ob)
Compares the specified object with this ACL entry for equality.
If the given object is not an
AclEntry
then this method
 immediately returns
false
.
For two ACL entries to be considered equals requires that they are
 both the same type, their who components are equal, their permissions
 components are equal, and their flags components are equal.
This method satisfies the general contract of the
Object.equals
method.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
ob
- the object to which this object is to be compared
Returns:
true
if, and only if, the given object is an AclEntry that
          is identical to this AclEntry

Object.hashCode()
HashMap
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Returns the hash-code value for this ACL entry.
This method satisfies the general contract of the
Object.hashCode()
method.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
a hash code value for this object.
See Also:
Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)
toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns the string representation of this ACL entry.
Overrides:

in class
Object
Returns:
the string representation of this entry
