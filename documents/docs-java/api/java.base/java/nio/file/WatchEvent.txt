Interface WatchEvent<T>
Type Parameters:
T
- The type of the context object associated with the event
public interface
WatchEvent<T>
An event or a repeated event for an object that is registered with a
WatchService
.
An event is classified by its
kind
and has a
count
to indicate the number of times that the event has been
 observed. This allows for efficient representation of repeated events. The
context
method returns any context associated with
 the event. In the case of a repeated event then the context is the same for
 all events.
Watch events are immutable and safe for use by multiple concurrent
 threads.
