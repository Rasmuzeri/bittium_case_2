Class FileTypeDetector
java.lang.Object
java.nio.file.spi.FileTypeDetector
public abstract class
FileTypeDetector
extends
Object
A file type detector for probing a file to guess its file type.
A file type detector is a concrete implementation of this class, has a
 zero-argument constructor, and implements the abstract methods specified
 below.
The means by which a file type detector determines the file type is
 highly implementation specific. A simple implementation might examine the
file extension
(a convention used in some platforms) and map it to
 a file type. In other cases, the file type may be stored as a file
attribute
or the bytes in a
 file may be examined to guess its file type.

public abstract
String
probeContentType
(
Path

throws
IOException
Probes the given file to guess its content type.
The means by which this method determines the file type is highly
 implementation specific. It may simply examine the file name, it may use
 a file
attribute
,
 or it may examine bytes in the file.
The probe result is the string form of the value of a
 Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) content type as
 defined by
RFC 2045:
 Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet
 Message Bodies
. The string must be parsable according to the
 grammar in the RFC 2045.
Parameters:
path
- the path to the file to probe
Returns:
The content type or
null
if the file type is not
          recognized
Throws:
IOException
- An I/O error occurs
SecurityException
- If the implementation requires to access the file, and a
          security manager is installed, and it denies an unspecified
          permission required by a file system provider implementation.
          If the file reference is associated with the default file system
          provider then the
SecurityManager.checkRead(String)
method
          is invoked to check read access to the file.
