Class MembershipKey
java.lang.Object
java.nio.channels.MembershipKey
public abstract class
MembershipKey
extends
Object
A token representing the membership of an Internet Protocol (IP) multicast
 group.
A membership key may represent a membership to receive all datagrams sent
 to the group, or it may be
source-specific
, meaning that it
 represents a membership that receives only datagrams from a specific source
 address. Whether or not a membership key is source-specific may be determined
 by invoking its
sourceAddress
method.
A membership key is valid upon creation and remains valid until the
 membership is dropped by invoking the
drop
method, or
 the channel is closed. The validity of the membership key may be tested
 by invoking its
isValid
method.
Where a membership key is not source-specific and the underlying operation
 system supports source filtering, then the
block
and
unblock
methods can be used to block or unblock multicast datagrams
 from particular source addresses.

Method Details
isValid
public abstract
boolean
isValid
()
Tells whether or not this membership is valid.
A multicast group membership is valid upon creation and remains
 valid until the membership is dropped by invoking the
drop
method, or the channel is closed.
Returns:
true
if this membership key is valid,
false
otherwise
drop
public abstract
void
drop
()
Drop membership.
If the membership key represents a membership to receive all datagrams
 then the membership is dropped and the channel will no longer receive any
 datagrams sent to the group. If the membership key is source-specific
 then the channel will no longer receive datagrams sent to the group from
 that source address.
After membership is dropped it may still be possible to receive
 datagrams sent to the group. This can arise when datagrams are waiting to
 be received in the socket's receive buffer. After membership is dropped
 then the channel may
join
the group again
 in which case a new membership key is returned.
Upon return, this membership object will be
invalid
.
 If the multicast group membership is already invalid then invoking this
 method has no effect. Once a multicast group membership is invalid,
 it remains invalid forever.
block
public abstract
MembershipKey
block
(
InetAddress
source)
throws
IOException
Block multicast datagrams from the given source address.
If this membership key is not source-specific, and the underlying
 operating system supports source filtering, then this method blocks
 multicast datagrams from the given source address. If the given source
 address is already blocked then this method has no effect.
 After a source address is blocked it may still be possible to receive
 datagrams from that source. This can arise when datagrams are waiting to
 be received in the socket's receive buffer.
Parameters:
source
- The source address to block
Returns:
This membership key
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- If the
source
parameter is not a unicast address or
          is not the same address type as the multicast group
IllegalStateException
- If this membership key is source-specific or is no longer valid
UnsupportedOperationException
- If the underlying operating system does not support source
          filtering
IOException
- If an I/O error occurs
unblock
public abstract
MembershipKey
unblock
(
InetAddress
source)
Unblock multicast datagrams from the given source address that was
 previously blocked using the
block
method.
Parameters:
source
- The source address to unblock
Returns:
This membership key
Throws:
IllegalStateException
- If the given source address is not currently blocked or the
          membership key is no longer valid
channel
public abstract
MulticastChannel
channel
()
Returns the channel for which this membership key was created. This
 method will continue to return the channel even after the membership
 becomes
invalid
.
Returns:
the channel
group
public abstract
InetAddress
group
()
Returns the multicast group for which this membership key was created.
 This method will continue to return the group even after the membership
 becomes
invalid
.
Returns:
the multicast group
networkInterface
public abstract
NetworkInterface
networkInterface
()
Returns the network interface for which this membership key was created.
 This method will continue to return the network interface even after the
 membership becomes
invalid
.
Returns:
the network interface
sourceAddress
public abstract
InetAddress
sourceAddress
()
Returns the source address if this membership key is source-specific,
 or
null
if this membership is not source-specific.
Returns:
The source address if this membership key is source-specific,
          otherwise
null
