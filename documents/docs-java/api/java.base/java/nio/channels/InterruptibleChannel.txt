public interface
InterruptibleChannel
extends
Channel
A channel that can be asynchronously closed and interrupted.
A channel that implements this interface is
asynchronously
 closeable:
If a thread is blocked in an I/O operation on an
 interruptible channel then another thread may invoke the channel's
close
method.  This will cause the blocked thread to receive an
AsynchronousCloseException
.
A channel that implements this interface is also
interruptible:
If a thread is blocked in an I/O operation on an interruptible channel then
 another thread may invoke the blocked thread's
interrupt
method.  This will cause the channel to be closed, the blocked
 thread to receive a
ClosedByInterruptException
, and the blocked
 thread's interrupt status to be set.
If a thread's interrupt status is already set and it invokes a blocking
 I/O operation upon a channel then the channel will be closed and the thread
 will immediately receive a
ClosedByInterruptException
; its interrupt
 status will remain set.
A channel supports asynchronous closing and interruption if, and only
 if, it implements this interface.  This can be tested at runtime, if
 necessary, via the
instanceof
operator.
