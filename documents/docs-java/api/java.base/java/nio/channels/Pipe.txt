Class Pipe
java.lang.Object
java.nio.channels.Pipe
public abstract class
Pipe
extends
Object
A pair of channels that implements a unidirectional pipe.
A pipe consists of a pair of channels: A writable
sink
channel and a readable
source
channel.  Once some bytes are written to the sink channel they can be read
 from the source channel in exactly the order in which they were written.
Whether or not a thread writing bytes to a pipe will block until another
 thread reads those bytes, or some previously-written bytes, from the pipe is
 system-dependent and therefore unspecified.  Many pipe implementations will
 buffer up to a certain number of bytes between the sink and source channels,
 but such buffering should not be assumed.
