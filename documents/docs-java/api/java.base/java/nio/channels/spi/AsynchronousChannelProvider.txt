Class AsynchronousChannelProvider
java.lang.Object
java.nio.channels.spi.AsynchronousChannelProvider
public abstract class
AsynchronousChannelProvider
extends
Object
Service-provider class for asynchronous channels.
An asynchronous channel provider is a concrete subclass of this class that
 has a zero-argument constructor and implements the abstract methods specified
 below.  A given invocation of the Java virtual machine maintains a single
 system-wide default provider instance, which is returned by the
provider
method.  The first invocation of that method will locate
 the default provider as specified below.
All of the methods in this class are safe for use by multiple concurrent
 threads.

Method Details
provider
public static
AsynchronousChannelProvider
provider
()
Returns the system-wide default asynchronous channel provider for this
 invocation of the Java virtual machine.
The first invocation of this method locates the default provider
 object as follows:
If the system property
java.nio.channels.spi.AsynchronousChannelProvider
is
   defined then it is taken to be the fully-qualified name of a concrete
   provider class. The class is loaded and instantiated; if this process
   fails then an unspecified error is thrown.
If a provider class has been installed in a jar file that is
   visible to the system class loader, and that jar file contains a
   provider-configuration file named
java.nio.channels.spi.AsynchronousChannelProvider
in the resource
   directory
META-INF/services
, then the first class name
   specified in that file is taken.  The class is loaded and
   instantiated; if this process fails then an unspecified error is
   thrown.
Finally, if no provider has been specified by any of the above
   means then the system-default provider class is instantiated and the
   result is returned.
Subsequent invocations of this method return the provider that was
 returned by the first invocation.
Returns:
The system-wide default AsynchronousChannel provider
