Type Parameters:
V
- The result type of the I/O operation
A
- The type of the object attached to the I/O operation
public interface
CompletionHandler<V,
A>
A handler for consuming the result of an asynchronous I/O operation.
The asynchronous channels defined in this package allow a completion
 handler to be specified to consume the result of an asynchronous operation.
 The
completed
method is invoked when the I/O operation
 completes successfully. The
failed
method is invoked if the
 I/O operations fails. The implementations of these methods should complete
 in a timely manner so as to avoid keeping the invoking thread from dispatching
 to other completion handlers.
