public interface
NetworkChannel
extends
Channel
A channel to a network socket.
A channel that implements this interface is a channel to a network
 socket. The
bind
method is used to bind the
 socket to a local
address
, the
getLocalAddress
method returns the address that the socket is bound to, and
 the
setOption
and
getOption
methods are used to set and query socket
 options.  An implementation of this interface should specify the socket options
 that it supports.
The
bind
and
setOption
methods that do
 not otherwise have a value to return are specified to return the network
 channel upon which they are invoked. This allows method invocations to be
 chained. Implementations of this interface should specialize the return type
 so that method invocations on the implementation class can be chained.

Method Details
bind
NetworkChannel
bind
(
SocketAddress
local)
throws
IOException
Binds the channel's socket to a local address.
This method is used to establish an association between the socket and
 a local address. Once an association is established then the socket remains
 bound until the channel is closed. If the
local
parameter has the
 value
null
then the socket will be bound to an address that is
 assigned automatically.
Parameters:
local
- The address to bind the socket, or
null
to bind the socket
          to an automatically assigned socket address
Returns:
This channel
Throws:
AlreadyBoundException
- If the socket is already bound
UnsupportedAddressTypeException
- If the type of the given address is not supported
ClosedChannelException
- If the channel is closed
IOException
- If some other I/O error occurs
SecurityException
- If a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified
          permission. An implementation of this interface should specify
          any required permissions.

getLocalAddress
()
                       throws
IOException
Returns the socket address that this channel's socket is bound to.
Where the channel is
bound
to an Internet Protocol
 socket address then the return value from this method is of type
InetSocketAddress
.
Returns:
The socket address that the socket is bound to, or
null
if the channel's socket is not bound
Throws:
ClosedChannelException
- If the channel is closed
IOException
- If an I/O error occurs
setOption
<T>
NetworkChannel
setOption
(
SocketOption
<T> name,
 T value)
throws
IOException
Sets the value of a socket option.
Type Parameters:
T
- The type of the socket option value
Parameters:
name
- The socket option
value
- The value of the socket option. A value of
null
may be
          a valid value for some socket options.
Returns:
This channel
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException
- If the socket option is not supported by this channel
IllegalArgumentException
- If the value is not a valid value for this socket option
ClosedChannelException
- If this channel is closed
IOException
- If an I/O error occurs

getOption
(
SocketOption
<T> name)
throws
IOException
Returns the value of a socket option.
Type Parameters:
T
- The type of the socket option value
Parameters:
name
- The socket option
Returns:
The value of the socket option. A value of
null
may be
          a valid value for some socket options.
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException
- If the socket option is not supported by this channel
ClosedChannelException
- If this channel is closed
IOException
- If an I/O error occurs

Set
<
SocketOption
<?>>
supportedOptions
()
Returns a set of the socket options supported by this channel.
This method will continue to return the set of options even after the
 channel has been closed.
Returns:
A set of the socket options supported by this channel
