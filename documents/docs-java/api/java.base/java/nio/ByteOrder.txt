Field Details
BIG_ENDIAN
public static final
ByteOrder
BIG_ENDIAN
Constant denoting big-endian byte order.  In this order, the bytes of a
 multibyte value are ordered from most significant to least significant.
LITTLE_ENDIAN
public static final
ByteOrder
LITTLE_ENDIAN
Constant denoting little-endian byte order.  In this order, the bytes of
 a multibyte value are ordered from least significant to most
 significant.
Method Details
nativeOrder
public static
ByteOrder
nativeOrder
()
Retrieves the native byte order of the underlying platform.
This method is defined so that performance-sensitive Java code can
 allocate direct buffers with the same byte order as the hardware.
 Native code libraries are often more efficient when such buffers are
 used.
Returns:
The native byte order of the hardware upon which this Java
          virtual machine is running
toString

String
toString
()
Constructs a string describing this object.
This method returns the string
"BIG_ENDIAN"
for
BIG_ENDIAN
and
"LITTLE_ENDIAN"
for
LITTLE_ENDIAN
.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
The specified string
