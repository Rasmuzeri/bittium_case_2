java.util.function.ToLongFunction
Packages that use
ToLongFunction
Package
Description
java.util
Contains the collections framework, some internationalization support classes,
 a service loader, properties, random number generation, string parsing
 and scanning classes, base64 encoding and decoding, a bit array, and
 several miscellaneous utility classes.
java.util.concurrent
Utility classes commonly useful in concurrent programming.
java.util.stream
Classes to support functional-style operations on streams of elements, such
 as map-reduce transformations on collections.
