Interface LongUnaryOperator
Functional Interface:
This is a functional interface and can therefore be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.
@FunctionalInterface
public interface
LongUnaryOperator
Represents an operation on a single
long
-valued operand that produces
 a
long
-valued result.  This is the primitive type specialization of
UnaryOperator
for
long
.
This is a
functional interface
whose functional method is
applyAsLong(long)
.
Since:
1.8

Returns a composed operator that first applies this operator to
 its input, and then applies the
after
operator to the result.

before
operator to its input, and then applies this operator to the result.

Returns a unary operator that always returns its input argument.
Method Details
applyAsLong
long
applyAsLong
(long operand)
Applies this operator to the given operand.
Parameters:
operand
- the operand
Returns:
the operator result
compose
default
LongUnaryOperator
compose
(
LongUnaryOperator
before)
Returns a composed operator that first applies the
before
operator to its input, and then applies this operator to the result.
 If evaluation of either operator throws an exception, it is relayed to
 the caller of the composed operator.
Parameters:
before
- the operator to apply before this operator is applied
Returns:
a composed operator that first applies the
before
operator and then applies this operator
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if before is null

andThen(LongUnaryOperator)
andThen
default
LongUnaryOperator
andThen
(
LongUnaryOperator
after)
Returns a composed operator that first applies this operator to
 its input, and then applies the
after
operator to the result.
 If evaluation of either operator throws an exception, it is relayed to
 the caller of the composed operator.
Parameters:
after
- the operator to apply after this operator is applied
Returns:
a composed operator that first applies this operator and then
 applies the
after
operator
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if after is null

()
Returns a unary operator that always returns its input argument.
Returns:
a unary operator that always returns its input argument
