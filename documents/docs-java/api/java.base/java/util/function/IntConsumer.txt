Interface IntConsumer
All Known Subinterfaces:
IntStream.Builder
All Known Implementing Classes:
IntSummaryStatistics
,
LongSummaryStatistics
Functional Interface:
This is a functional interface and can therefore be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.
@FunctionalInterface
public interface
IntConsumer
Represents an operation that accepts a single
int
-valued argument and
 returns no result.  This is the primitive type specialization of
Consumer
for
int
.  Unlike most other functional interfaces,
IntConsumer
is expected to operate via side-effects.
This is a
functional interface
whose functional method is
accept(int)
.
Since:
1.8

accept
void
accept
(int value)
Performs this operation on the given argument.
Parameters:
value
- the input argument
andThen
default
IntConsumer
andThen
(
IntConsumer
after)
Returns a composed
IntConsumer
that performs, in sequence, this
 operation followed by the
after
operation. If performing either
 operation throws an exception, it is relayed to the caller of the
 composed operation.  If performing this operation throws an exception,
 the
after
operation will not be performed.
Parameters:
after
- the operation to perform after this operation
Returns:
a composed
IntConsumer
that performs in sequence this
 operation followed by the
after
operation
Throws:
