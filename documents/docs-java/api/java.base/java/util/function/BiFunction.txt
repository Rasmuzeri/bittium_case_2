 If evaluation of either function throws an exception, it is relayed to
 the caller of the composed function.
Type Parameters:
V
- the type of output of the
after
function, and of the
           composed function
Parameters:
after
- the function to apply after this function is applied
Returns:
a composed function that first applies this function and then
 applies the
after
function
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if after is null
