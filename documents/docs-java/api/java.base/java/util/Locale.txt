A
Locale
object represents a specific geographical, political,
 or cultural region. An operation that requires a
Locale
to perform
 its task is called
locale-sensitive
and uses the
Locale
to tailor information for the user. For example, displaying a number
 is a locale-sensitive operation— the number should be formatted
 according to the customs and conventions of the user's native country,
 region, or culture.
The
Locale
class implements IETF BCP 47 which is composed of
RFC 4647 "Matching of Language
 Tags"
and
RFC 5646 "Tags
 for Identifying Languages"
with support for the LDML (UTS#35, "Unicode
 Locale Data Markup Language") BCP 47-compatible extensions for locale data
 exchange.
A
Locale
object logically consists of the fields
 described below.
language
ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 language code, or registered
   language subtags up to 8 alpha letters (for future enhancements).
   When a language has both an alpha-2 code and an alpha-3 code, the
   alpha-2 code must be used.  You can find a full list of valid
   language codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for
   "Type: language").  The language field is case insensitive, but
Locale
always canonicalizes to lower case.
Well-formed language values have the form
[a-zA-Z]{2,8}
.  Note that this is not the full
   BCP47 language production, since it excludes extlang.  They are
   not needed since modern three-letter language codes replace
   them.
Example: "en" (English), "ja" (Japanese), "kok" (Konkani)
script
ISO 15924 alpha-4 script code.  You can find a full list of
   valid script codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search
   for "Type: script").  The script field is case insensitive, but
Locale
always canonicalizes to title case (the first
   letter is upper case and the rest of the letters are lower
   case).
Well-formed script values have the form
[a-zA-Z]{4}
Example: "Latn" (Latin), "Cyrl" (Cyrillic)
country (region)
ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code or UN M.49 numeric-3 area code.
   You can find a full list of valid country and region codes in the
   IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: region").  The
   country (region) field is case insensitive, but
Locale
always canonicalizes to upper case.
Well-formed country/region values have
   the form
[a-zA-Z]{2} | [0-9]{3}
Example: "US" (United States), "FR" (France), "029"
   (Caribbean)
variant
Any arbitrary value used to indicate a variation of a
Locale
.  Where there are two or more variant values
   each indicating its own semantics, these values should be ordered
   by importance, with most important first, separated by
   underscore('_').  The variant field is case sensitive.
Note: IETF BCP 47 places syntactic restrictions on variant
   subtags.  Also BCP 47 subtags are strictly used to indicate
   additional variations that define a language or its dialects that
   are not covered by any combinations of language, script and
   region subtags.  You can find a full list of valid variant codes
   in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: variant").
However, the variant field in
Locale
has
   historically been used for any kind of variation, not just
   language variations.  For example, some supported variants
   available in Java SE Runtime Environments indicate alternative
   cultural behaviors such as calendar type or number script.  In
   BCP 47 this kind of information, which does not identify the
   language, is supported by extension subtags or private use
   subtags.
Well-formed variant values have the form
SUBTAG
   (('_'|'-') SUBTAG)*
where
SUBTAG =
   [0-9][0-9a-zA-Z]{3} | [0-9a-zA-Z]{5,8}
. (Note: BCP 47 only
   uses hyphen ('-') as a delimiter, this is more lenient).
Example: "polyton" (Polytonic Greek), "POSIX"
extensions
A map from single character keys to string values, indicating
   extensions apart from language identification.  The extensions in
Locale
implement the semantics and syntax of BCP 47
   extension subtags and private use subtags. The extensions are
   case insensitive, but
Locale
canonicalizes all
   extension keys and values to lower case. Note that extensions
   cannot have empty values.
Well-formed keys are single characters from the set
[0-9a-zA-Z]
.  Well-formed values have the form
SUBTAG ('-' SUBTAG)*
where for the key 'x'
SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}
and for other keys
SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{2,8}
(that is, 'x' allows
   single-character subtags).
Example: key="u"/value="ca-japanese" (Japanese Calendar),
   key="x"/value="java-1-7"
Note:
Although BCP 47 requires field values to be registered
 in the IANA Language Subtag Registry, the
Locale
class
 does not provide any validation features.  The
Builder
only checks if an individual field satisfies the syntactic
 requirement (is well-formed), but does not validate the value
 itself.  See
Locale.Builder
for details.
Unicode locale/language extension
UTS#35, "Unicode Locale Data Markup Language" defines optional
 attributes and keywords to override or refine the default behavior
 associated with a locale.  A keyword is represented by a pair of
 key and type.  For example, "nu-thai" indicates that Thai local
 digits (value:"thai") should be used for formatting numbers
 (key:"nu").
The keywords are mapped to a BCP 47 extension value using the
 extension key 'u' (
UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION
).  The above
 example, "nu-thai", becomes the extension "u-nu-thai".
Thus, when a
Locale
object contains Unicode locale
 attributes and keywords,
getExtension(UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION)
will return a
 String representing this information, for example, "nu-thai".  The
Locale
class also provides
getUnicodeLocaleAttributes()
,
getUnicodeLocaleKeys()
, and
getUnicodeLocaleType(java.lang.String)
which allow you to access Unicode
 locale attributes and key/type pairs directly.  When represented as
 a string, the Unicode Locale Extension lists attributes
 alphabetically, followed by key/type sequences with keys listed
 alphabetically (the order of subtags comprising a key's type is
 fixed when the type is defined)
A well-formed locale key has the form
[0-9a-zA-Z]{2}
.  A well-formed locale type has the
 form
"" | [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8} ('-' [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8})*
(it
 can be empty, or a series of subtags 3-8 alphanums in length).  A
 well-formed locale attribute has the form
[0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8}
(it is a single subtag with the same
 form as a locale type subtag).
The Unicode locale extension specifies optional behavior in
 locale-sensitive services.  Although the LDML specification defines
 various keys and values, actual locale-sensitive service
 implementations in a Java Runtime Environment might not support any
 particular Unicode locale attributes or key/type pairs.
Obtaining a Locale
There are several ways to obtain a
Locale
object.
Builder
Using
Locale.Builder
you can construct a
Locale
object
 that conforms to BCP 47 syntax.
Factory Methods
The method
forLanguageTag(java.lang.String)
obtains a
Locale
object for a well-formed BCP 47 language tag. The method
of(String, String, String)
and its overloads obtain a
Locale
object from given
language
,
country
,
 and/or
variant
defined above.
Locale Constants
The
Locale
class provides a number of convenient constants
 that you can use to obtain
Locale
objects for commonly used
 locales. For example,
Locale.US
is the
Locale
object
 for the United States.
Locale Matching
If an application or a system is internationalized and provides localized
 resources for multiple locales, it sometimes needs to find one or more
 locales (or language tags) which meet each user's specific preferences. Note
 that a term "language tag" is used interchangeably with "locale" in this
 locale matching documentation.
In order to do matching a user's preferred locales to a set of language
 tags,
RFC 4647 Matching of
 Language Tags
defines two mechanisms: filtering and lookup.
Filtering
is used to get all matching locales, whereas
lookup
is to choose the best matching locale.
 Matching is done case-insensitively. These matching mechanisms are described
 in the following sections.
A user's preference is called a
Language Priority List
and is
 expressed as a list of language ranges. There are syntactically two types of
 language ranges: basic and extended. See
Locale.LanguageRange
for details.
Filtering
The filtering operation returns all matching language tags. It is defined
 in RFC 4647 as follows:
 "In filtering, each language range represents the least specific language
 tag (that is, the language tag with fewest number of subtags) that is an
 acceptable match. All of the language tags in the matching set of tags will
 have an equal or greater number of subtags than the language range. Every
 non-wildcard subtag in the language range will appear in every one of the
 matching language tags."
There are two types of filtering: filtering for basic language ranges
 (called "basic filtering") and filtering for extended language ranges
 (called "extended filtering"). They may return different results by what
 kind of language ranges are included in the given Language Priority List.
Locale.FilteringMode
is a parameter to specify how filtering should
 be done.
Lookup
The lookup operation returns the best matching language tags. It is
 defined in RFC 4647 as follows:
 "By contrast with filtering, each language range represents the most
 specific tag that is an acceptable match.  The first matching tag found,
 according to the user's priority, is considered the closest match and is the
 item returned."
For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,
"zh-Hant-TW"
and
"en-US"
, in prioritized order, lookup
 method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
 best matching language tag.
1. zh-Hant-TW
    2. zh-Hant
    3. zh
    4. en-US
    5. en
If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
 above, the language tag is returned.
"*"
is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.
If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag
'*'
included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
 an
Iterator
over a
Collection
of language tags is treated as
 the best matching one.
Use of Locale
Once you've obtained a
Locale
you can query it for information
 about itself. Use
getCountry
to get the country (or region)
 code and
getLanguage
to get the language code.
 You can use
getDisplayCountry
to get the
 name of the country suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly,
 you can use
getDisplayLanguage
to get the name of
 the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
 the
getDisplayXXX
methods are themselves locale-sensitive
 and have two versions: one that uses the default
DISPLAY
locale and one
 that uses the locale specified as an argument.
The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
 operations. For example, the
NumberFormat
class formats
 numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
 such as
NumberFormat
have several convenience methods
 for creating a default object of that type. For example, the
NumberFormat
class provides these three convenience methods
 for creating a default
NumberFormat
object:
Copy
NumberFormat.getInstance();
    NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance();
    NumberFormat.getPercentInstance();
Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
 and one without; the latter uses the default
FORMAT
locale:
Copy
NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale);
    NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale);
    NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale);
A
Locale
is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
 (
NumberFormat
) that you would like to get. The locale is
just
a mechanism for identifying objects,
not
a container for the objects themselves.
Compatibility
In order to maintain compatibility, Locale's
 constructors retain their behavior prior to the Java Runtime
 Environment version 1.7.  The same is largely true for the
toString
method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
 be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
 of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
 to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
 variant field will have additional information in it if script or
 extensions are present.
In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
 imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
 between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
 losing information. Thus
toLanguageTag
cannot
 represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
 do not conform to BCP 47.
Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
 away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the
forLanguageTag
and
Locale.Builder
APIs instead.
 Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
 then always rely on
toLanguageTag
for this purpose.
Special cases
For compatibility reasons, two
 non-conforming locales are treated as special cases.  These are
ja_JP_JP
and
th_TH_TH
. These are ill-formed
 in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
 these are treated specially during construction.  These two cases (and only
 these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
 exactly as they did prior to Java 7.
Java has used
ja_JP_JP
to represent Japanese as used in
 Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
 representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
 Unicode locale key
ca
(for "calendar") and type
japanese
. When the Locale constructor is called with the
 arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
 automatically added.
Java has used
th_TH_TH
to represent Thai as used in
 Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
 a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key
nu
(for "number") and value
thai
. When the Locale
 constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
 extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.
Serialization
During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
 stream, including extensions.
During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
 in
Special Cases
, only
 for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.
Legacy language codes
Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
 their earlier, obsoleted forms:
he
maps to
iw
,
yi
maps to
ji
, and
id
maps to
in
. Since Java SE 17, this is no longer the case. Each
 language maps to its new form;
iw
maps to
he
,
ji
maps to
yi
, and
in
maps to
id
.
For the backward compatible behavior, the system property
java.locale.useOldISOCodes
reverts the behavior
 back to that of before Java SE 17. If the system property is set to
true
, those three current language codes are mapped to their
 backward compatible forms. The property is only read at Java runtime
 startup and subsequent calls to
System.setProperty()
will
 have no effect.
The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
 maintaining the mapped codes internal to Locale (so that
getLanguage
and
toString
reflect the mapped
 code, which depends on the
java.locale.useOldISOCodes
system
 property), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
 that
toLanguageTag
reflects the new one). This
 preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
 API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
 lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
 can be named using either convention, see
ResourceBundle.Control
.
Three-letter language/country(region) codes
The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
 and the country param be two characters in length, although in
 practice they have accepted any length.  The specification has now
 been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
 country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
 particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
 codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.  For
 compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
 constraint.

getDefault
public static
Locale
getDefault
()
Gets the current value of the default locale for this instance
 of the Java Virtual Machine.
The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup
 based on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive
 methods if no locale is explicitly specified.
 It can be changed using the
setDefault
method.
Returns:
the default locale for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine
getDefault
public static
Locale
getDefault
(
Locale.Category
category)
Gets the current value of the default locale for the specified Category
 for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine.
The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup based
 on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive methods
 if no locale is explicitly specified. It can be changed using the
 setDefault(Locale.Category, Locale) method.
Parameters:
category
- the specified category to get the default locale
Returns:
the default locale for the specified Category for this instance
     of the Java Virtual Machine
Throws:

newLocale)
Sets the default locale for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine.
 This does not affect the host locale.
If there is a security manager, its
checkPermission
method is called with a
PropertyPermission("user.language", "write")
permission before the default locale is changed.
The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup
 based on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive
 methods if no locale is explicitly specified.
Since changing the default locale may affect many different areas
 of functionality, this method should only be used if the caller
 is prepared to reinitialize locale-sensitive code running
 within the same Java Virtual Machine.
By setting the default locale with this method, all of the default
 locales for each Category are also set to the specified default locale.
Parameters:
newLocale
- the new default locale
Throws:
SecurityException
- if a security manager exists and its
checkPermission
method doesn't allow the operation.
NullPointerException
- if
newLocale
is null

getISOCountries
public static
String
[]
getISOCountries
()
Returns a list of all 2-letter country codes defined in ISO 3166.
 Can be used to obtain Locales.
 This method is equivalent to
getISOCountries(Locale.IsoCountryCode type)
with
type
Locale.IsoCountryCode.PART1_ALPHA2
.
Note:
The
Locale
class also supports other codes for
 country (region), such as 3-letter numeric UN M.49 area codes.
 Therefore, the list returned by this method does not contain ALL valid
 codes that can be used to obtain Locales.
Note that this method does not return obsolete 2-letter country codes.
 ISO3166-3 codes which designate country codes for those obsolete codes,
 can be retrieved from
getISOCountries(Locale.IsoCountryCode type)

()
Returns a list of all 2-letter language codes defined in ISO 639.
 Can be used to obtain Locales.
Note:
ISO 639 is not a stable standard— some languages' codes have changed.
 The list this function returns includes both the new and the old codes for the
 languages whose codes have changed.
The
Locale
class also supports language codes up to
 8 characters in length.  Therefore, the list returned by this method does
 not contain ALL valid codes that can be used to obtain Locales.
Returns:
An array of ISO 639 two-letter language codes.
getLanguage

toString
public final
String
toString
()
Returns a string representation of this
Locale
object, consisting of language, country, variant, script,
 and extensions as below:
language + "_" + country + "_" + (variant + "_#" | "#") + script + "_" + extensions
Language is always lower case, country is always upper case, script is always title
 case, and extensions are always lower case.  Extensions and private use subtags
 will be in canonical order as explained in
toLanguageTag()
.
When the locale has neither script nor extensions, the result is the same as in
 Java 6 and prior.
If both the language and country fields are missing, this function will return
 the empty string, even if the variant, script, or extensions field is present (you
 can't have a locale with just a variant, the variant must accompany a well-formed
 language or country code).
If script or extensions are present and variant is missing, no underscore is
 added before the "#".
This behavior is designed to support debugging and to be compatible with
 previous uses of
toString
that expected language, country, and variant
 fields only.  To represent a Locale as a String for interchange purposes, use
toLanguageTag()
.
Examples:
en
de_DE

toLanguageTag
public
String
toLanguageTag
()
Returns a well-formed IETF BCP 47 language tag representing
 this locale.
If this
Locale
has a language, country, or
 variant that does not satisfy the IETF BCP 47 language tag
 syntax requirements, this method handles these fields as
 described below:
Language:
If language is empty, or not
well-formed
(for example "a" or
 "e2"), it will be emitted as "und" (Undetermined).
Country:
If country is not
well-formed
(for example "12" or "USA"), it will be omitted.
Variant:
If variant
is
well-formed
, each sub-segment
 (delimited by '-' or '_') is emitted as a subtag.  Otherwise:
if all sub-segments match
[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}
(for example "WIN" or "Oracle_JDK_Standard_Edition"), the first
 ill-formed sub-segment and all following will be appended to
 the private use subtag.  The first appended subtag will be
 "lvariant", followed by the sub-segments in order, separated by
 hyphen. For example, "x-lvariant-WIN",
 "Oracle-x-lvariant-JDK-Standard-Edition".
if any sub-segment does not match
[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}
, the variant will be truncated
 and the problematic sub-segment and all following sub-segments
 will be omitted.  If the remainder is non-empty, it will be
 emitted as a private use subtag as above (even if the remainder
 turns out to be well-formed).  For example,
 "Solaris_isjustthecoolestthing" is emitted as
 "x-lvariant-Solaris", not as "solaris".
Special Conversions:
Java supports some old locale
 representations, including deprecated ISO language codes,
 for compatibility. This method performs the following
 conversions:
Deprecated ISO language codes "iw", "ji", and "in" are
 converted to "he", "yi", and "id", respectively.
A locale with language "no", country "NO", and variant
 "NY", representing Norwegian Nynorsk (Norway), is converted
 to a language tag "nn-NO".
Note:
Although the language tag obtained by this
 method is well-formed (satisfies the syntax requirements
 defined by the IETF BCP 47 specification), it is not
 necessarily a valid BCP 47 language tag.  For example,
Copy
Locale.forLanguageTag("xx-YY").toLanguageTag();
will return "xx-YY", but the language subtag "xx" and the
 region subtag "YY" are invalid because they are not registered
 in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.
Returns:
a BCP47 language tag representing the locale
Since:
1.7
See Also:
forLanguageTag(String)
caseFoldLanguageTag
public static
String
caseFoldLanguageTag
(
String
languageTag)
Returns a case folded IETF BCP 47 language tag.
This method formats a language tag into one with case convention
 that adheres to section 2.1.1. Formatting of Language Tags of RFC5646.
 This format is defined as:
All subtags, including extension and private
 use subtags, use lowercase letters with two exceptions: two-letter
 and four-letter subtags that neither appear at the start of the tag
 nor occur after singletons. Such two-letter subtags are all
 uppercase (as in the tags "en-CA-x-ca" or "sgn-BE-FR") and four-
 letter subtags are titlecase (as in the tag "az-Latn-x-latn").
As
 legacy tags, (defined as "grandfathered" in RFC5646) are not always well-formed, this method
 will simply case fold a legacy tag to match the exact case convention
 for the particular tag specified in the respective
Legacy tags
table.
Special Exceptions
To maintain consistency with
variant
which is case-sensitive, this method will neither case fold variant
 subtags nor case fold private use subtags prefixed by
lvariant
.
For example,
Copy
String tag = "ja-kana-jp-x-lvariant-Oracle-JDK-Standard-Edition";
Locale.caseFoldLanguageTag(tag); // returns "ja-Kana-JP-x-lvariant-Oracle-JDK-Standard-Edition"
String tag2 = "ja-kana-jp-x-Oracle-JDK-Standard-Edition";
Locale.caseFoldLanguageTag(tag2); // returns "ja-Kana-JP-x-oracle-jdk-standard-edition"
Excluding case folding, this method makes no modifications to the tag itself.
 Case convention of language tags does not carry meaning, and is simply
 recommended as it corresponds with various ISO standards, including:
 ISO639-1, ISO15924, and ISO3166-1.
As the formatting of the case convention is dependent on the
 positioning of certain subtags, callers of this method should ensure

forLanguageTag
public static
Locale
forLanguageTag
(
String
languageTag)
Returns a locale for the specified IETF BCP 47 language tag string.
If the specified language tag contains any ill-formed subtags,
 the first such subtag and all following subtags are ignored.  Compare
 to
Locale.Builder.setLanguageTag(java.lang.String)
which throws an exception
 in this case.
The following
conversions
are performed:
The language code "und" is mapped to language "".
The language codes "iw", "ji", and "in" are mapped to "he",
 "yi", and "id" respectively. (This is the same canonicalization
 that's done in Locale's constructors.) See
Legacy language codes
for more information.
The portion of a private use subtag prefixed by "lvariant",
 if any, is removed and appended to the variant field in the
 result locale (without case normalization).  If it is then
 empty, the private use subtag is discarded:
Copy
Locale loc;
    loc = Locale.forLanguageTag("en-US-x-lvariant-POSIX");
    loc.getVariant(); // returns "POSIX"
    loc.getExtension('x'); // returns null

    loc = Locale.forLanguageTag("de-POSIX-x-URP-lvariant-Abc-Def");
    loc.getVariant(); // returns "POSIX_Abc_Def"
    loc.getExtension('x'); // returns "urp"
When the languageTag argument contains an extlang subtag,
 the first such subtag is used as the language, and the primary
 language subtag and other extlang subtags are ignored:
Copy
Locale.forLanguageTag("ar-aao").getLanguage(); // returns "aao"
    Locale.forLanguageTag("en-abc-def-us").toString(); // returns "abc_US"
Case is normalized except for variant tags, which are left
 unchanged.  Language is normalized to lower case, script to
 title case, country to upper case, and extensions to lower
 case.
If, after processing, the locale would exactly match either
 ja_JP_JP or th_TH_TH with no extensions, the appropriate
 extensions are added as though the constructor had been called:
Copy
Locale.forLanguageTag("ja-JP-x-lvariant-JP").toLanguageTag();
   // returns "ja-JP-u-ca-japanese-x-lvariant-JP"
   Locale.forLanguageTag("th-TH-x-lvariant-TH").toLanguageTag();
   // returns "th-TH-u-nu-thai-x-lvariant-TH"
This implements the 'Language-Tag' production of BCP47, and
 so supports legacy (regular and irregular, referred to as
 "Type: grandfathered" in BCP47) as well as
 private use language tags.  Stand alone private use tags are
 represented as empty language and extension 'x-whatever',
 and legacy tags are converted to their canonical replacements
 where they exist.
Legacy tags with canonical replacements are as follows:

Returns a three-letter abbreviation of this locale's language.

 If the language matches an ISO 639-1 two-letter code, the
 corresponding ISO 639-2/T three-letter lowercase code is
 returned.  The ISO 639-2 language codes can be found on-line,
 see "Codes for the Representation of Names of Languages Part 2:
 Alpha-3 Code".  If the locale specifies a three-letter
 language, the language is returned as is.  If the locale does
 not specify a language the empty string is returned.
Returns:
a three-letter abbreviation of this locale's language
Throws:
MissingResourceException
- Throws MissingResourceException if
 three-letter language abbreviation is not available for this locale.

locale
 is en_US, getDisplayLanguage() will return "French"; if the locale is en_US and
 the default
DISPLAY
locale is fr_FR,
 getDisplayLanguage() will return "anglais".
 If the name returned cannot be localized for the default
DISPLAY
