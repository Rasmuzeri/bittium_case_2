Class OptionalDouble
java.lang.Object
java.util.OptionalDouble
public final class
OptionalDouble
extends
Object
A container object which may or may not contain a
double
value.
 If a value is present,
isPresent()
returns
true
. If no
 value is present, the object is considered
empty
and
isPresent()
returns
false
.
Additional methods that depend on the presence or absence of a contained
 value are provided, such as
orElse()
(returns a default value if no value is present) and
ifPresent()
(performs
 an action if a value is present).
This is a
value-based
class; programmers should treat instances that are
equal
as interchangeable and should not
 use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may
 occur. For example, in a future release, synchronization may fail.
API Note:
OptionalDouble
is primarily intended for use as a method return type where
 there is a clear need to represent "no result." A variable whose type is
OptionalDouble
should never itself be
null
; it should always point
 to an
OptionalDouble
instance.

Method Details
empty
public static
OptionalDouble
empty
()
Returns an empty
OptionalDouble
instance.  No value is present
 for this
OptionalDouble
.
API Note:
Though it may be tempting to do so, avoid testing if an object is empty
 by comparing with
==
or
!=
against instances returned by
OptionalDouble.empty()
.  There is no guarantee that it is a singleton.
 Instead, use
isEmpty()
or
isPresent()
.
Returns:
an empty
OptionalDouble
.
of
public static
OptionalDouble
of
(double value)

describing the given value.
Parameters:
value
- the value to describe
Returns:
an
OptionalDouble
with the value present
getAsDouble
public
double
getAsDouble
()
If a value is present, returns the value, otherwise throws
NoSuchElementException
.
API Note:
The preferred alternative to this method is
orElseThrow()
.
Returns:
the value described by this
OptionalDouble
Throws:
NoSuchElementException
- if no value is present
isPresent
public
boolean
isPresent
()
If a value is present, returns
true

false
.
Returns:
true
if a value is present, otherwise

isEmpty
()
If a value is not present, returns
true

ifPresent
public
void
ifPresent
(
DoubleConsumer
action)
If a value is present, performs the given action with the value,
 otherwise does nothing.
Parameters:
action
- the action to be performed, if a value is present
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if value is present and the given action is
null
ifPresentOrElse
public
void
ifPresentOrElse

If a value is present, performs the given action with the value,
 otherwise performs the given empty-based action.
Parameters:

- the action to be performed, if a value is present
emptyAction
- the empty-based action to be performed, if no value is
 present
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if a value is present and the given action
         is
null
, or no value is present and the given empty-based
         action is
null
.

DoubleStream
stream
()
If a value is present, returns a sequential

This method can be used to transform a
Stream
of optional doubles
 to a

of present doubles:
Stream<OptionalDouble> os = ..
     DoubleStream s = os.flatMapToDouble(OptionalDouble::stream)

A method reference to the exception constructor with an empty argument
 list can be used as the supplier. For example,
IllegalStateException::new

equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this
OptionalDouble
. The other object is considered equal if:
it is also an
OptionalDouble
and;
both instances have no value present or;
the present values are "equal to" each other via
Double.compare() == 0
.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- an object to be tested for equality
Returns:
true
if the other object is "equal to" this object
         otherwise
false

Object.hashCode()
HashMap
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Returns the hash code of the value, if present, otherwise
0
(zero) if no value is present.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
hash code value of the present value or
0
if no value is
         present

toString
public
String
toString

Returns a non-empty string representation of this
OptionalDouble
suitable for debugging.  The exact presentation format is unspecified and
 may vary between implementations and versions.
Overrides:
toString

If a value is present the result must include its string representation
 in the result.  Empty and present
OptionalDouble
s must be
 unambiguously differentiable.
Returns:
the string representation of this instance
