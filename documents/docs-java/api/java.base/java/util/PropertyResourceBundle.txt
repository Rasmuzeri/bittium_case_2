Class PropertyResourceBundle
java.lang.Object
java.util.ResourceBundle
java.util.PropertyResourceBundle
public class
PropertyResourceBundle
extends
ResourceBundle
PropertyResourceBundle
is a concrete subclass of
ResourceBundle
that manages resources for a locale
 using a set of static strings from a property file. See
ResourceBundle
for more information about resource
 bundles.
Unlike other types of resource bundle, you don't subclass
PropertyResourceBundle
.  Instead, you supply properties
 files containing the resource data.
ResourceBundle.getBundle
will automatically look for the appropriate properties file and create a
PropertyResourceBundle
that refers to it. See
ResourceBundle.getBundle
for a complete description of the search and instantiation strategy.
The following
example
shows a member of a resource
 bundle family with the base name "MyResources".
 The text defines the bundle "MyResources_de",
 the German member of the bundle family.
 This member is based on
PropertyResourceBundle
, and the text
 therefore is the content of the file "MyResources_de.properties"
 (a related
example
shows
 how you can add bundles to this family that are implemented as subclasses
 of
ListResourceBundle
).
 The keys in this example are of the form "s1" etc. The actual
 keys are entirely up to your choice, so long as they are the same as
 the keys you use in your program to retrieve the objects from the bundle.
 Keys are case-sensitive.

API Note:
PropertyResourceBundle
can be constructed either
 from an
InputStream
or a
Reader
, which represents a property file.
 Constructing a
PropertyResourceBundle
instance from an
InputStream
requires that the input stream be encoded in
UTF-8
. By default, if a
MalformedInputException
or an
UnmappableCharacterException
occurs on reading the
 input stream, then the
PropertyResourceBundle
instance resets to the state
 before the exception, re-reads the input stream in
ISO-8859-1
, and
 continues reading. If the system property
java.util.PropertyResourceBundle.encoding
is set to either
 "ISO-8859-1" or "UTF-8", the input stream is solely read in that encoding,
 and throws the exception if it encounters an invalid sequence.
 If "ISO-8859-1" is specified, characters that cannot be represented in
 ISO-8859-1 encoding must be represented by Unicode Escapes as defined in section
3.3
of
The Java Language Specification
whereas the other constructor which takes a
Reader
does not have that limitation.
 Other encoding values are ignored for this system property.
 The system property is read and evaluated when initializing this class.
 Changing or removing the property has no effect after the initialization.
Implementation Requirements:
The implementation of a
PropertyResourceBundle
subclass must be
 thread-safe if it's simultaneously used by multiple threads. The default
 implementations of the non-abstract methods in this class are thread-safe.

Constructor Details
PropertyResourceBundle
public
PropertyResourceBundle
(
InputStream
stream)
throws
IOException
Creates a property resource bundle from an
InputStream
. This constructor reads the property file in UTF-8 by default.
 If a
MalformedInputException
or an
UnmappableCharacterException
occurs on reading the
 input stream, then the PropertyResourceBundle instance resets to the state
 before the exception, re-reads the input stream in
ISO-8859-1
and
 continues reading. If the system property
java.util.PropertyResourceBundle.encoding
is set to either
 "ISO-8859-1" or "UTF-8", the input stream is solely read in that encoding,
 and throws the exception if it encounters an invalid sequence. Other
 encoding values are ignored for this system property.
 The system property is read and evaluated when initializing this class.
 Changing or removing the property has no effect after the initialization.
Parameters:
stream
- an InputStream that represents a property file
        to read from.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs
NullPointerException
- if
stream
is null
IllegalArgumentException
- if
stream
contains a
     malformed Unicode escape sequence.
MalformedInputException
- if the system property
java.util.PropertyResourceBundle.encoding
is set to "UTF-8"
     and
stream
contains an invalid UTF-8 byte sequence.
UnmappableCharacterException
- if the system property
java.util.PropertyResourceBundle.encoding
is set to "UTF-8"
     and
stream
contains an unmappable UTF-8 byte sequence.
PropertyResourceBundle
public
PropertyResourceBundle
(
Reader
reader)
throws
IOException
Creates a property resource bundle from a
Reader
.  Unlike the constructor
PropertyResourceBundle(InputStream)
,
 there is no limitation as to the encoding of the input property file.
Parameters:
reader
- a Reader that represents a property file to
        read from.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs
NullPointerException
- if
reader
is null
IllegalArgumentException
- if a malformed Unicode escape sequence appears
     from
reader
.
