Calendar
GregorianCalendar
is a concrete subclass of
Calendar
and provides the standard calendar system
 used by most of the world.
GregorianCalendar
is a hybrid calendar that
 supports both the Julian and Gregorian calendar systems with the
 support of a single discontinuity, which corresponds by default to
 the Gregorian date when the Gregorian calendar was instituted
 (October 15, 1582 in some countries, later in others).  The cutover
 date may be changed by the caller by calling
setGregorianChange()
.
Historically, in those countries which adopted the Gregorian calendar first,
 October 4, 1582 (Julian) was thus followed by October 15, 1582 (Gregorian). This calendar models
 this correctly.  Before the Gregorian cutover,
GregorianCalendar
implements the Julian calendar.  The only difference between the Gregorian
 and the Julian calendar is the leap year rule. The Julian calendar specifies
 leap years every four years, whereas the Gregorian calendar omits century
 years which are not divisible by 400.
GregorianCalendar
implements
proleptic
Gregorian and
 Julian calendars. That is, dates are computed by extrapolating the current
 rules indefinitely far backward and forward in time. As a result,
GregorianCalendar
may be used for all years to generate
 meaningful and consistent results. However, dates obtained using
GregorianCalendar
are historically accurate only from March 1, 4
 AD onward, when modern Julian calendar rules were adopted.  Before this date,
 leap year rules were applied irregularly, and before 45 BC the Julian
 calendar did not even exist.
Prior to the institution of the Gregorian calendar, New Year's Day was
 March 25. To avoid confusion, this calendar always uses January 1. A manual
 adjustment may be made if desired for dates that are prior to the Gregorian
 changeover and which fall between January 1 and March 24.
Week Of Year and Week Year
Values calculated for the
WEEK_OF_YEAR
field range from 1 to 53. The first week of a
 calendar year is the earliest seven day period starting on
getFirstDayOfWeek()
that contains at
 least
getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()
days from that year. It thus depends
 on the values of
getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()
,
getFirstDayOfWeek()
, and the day of the week of January 1. Weeks
 between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the following year
 (exclusive) are numbered sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (except
 for year(s) involved in the Julian-Gregorian transition).
The
getFirstDayOfWeek()
and
getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()
values are initialized using
 locale-dependent resources when constructing a
GregorianCalendar
.
The week
 determination is compatible
with the ISO 8601 standard when
getFirstDayOfWeek()
is
MONDAY
and
getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()
is 4, which values are used in locales
 where the standard is preferred. These values can explicitly be set by
 calling
setFirstDayOfWeek()
and
setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()
.
A
week year
is in sync with a
WEEK_OF_YEAR
cycle. All weeks between the first and last
 weeks (inclusive) have the same
week year
value.
 Therefore, the first and last days of a week year may have
 different calendar year values.
For example, January 1, 1998 is a Thursday. If
getFirstDayOfWeek()
is
MONDAY
and
getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()
is 4 (ISO 8601 standard compatible
 setting), then week 1 of 1998 starts on December 29, 1997, and ends
 on January 4, 1998. The week year is 1998 for the last three days
 of calendar year 1997. If, however,
getFirstDayOfWeek()
is
SUNDAY
, then week 1 of 1998 starts on January 4, 1998, and
 ends on January 10, 1998; the first three days of 1998 then are
 part of week 53 of 1997 and their week year is 1997.
Week Of Month
Values calculated for the
WEEK_OF_MONTH
field range from 0
 to 6.  Week 1 of a month (the days with
WEEK_OF_MONTH =
 1
) is the earliest set of at least
getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()
contiguous days in that month,
 ending on the day before
getFirstDayOfWeek()
.  Unlike
 week 1 of a year, week 1 of a month may be shorter than 7 days, need
 not start on
getFirstDayOfWeek()
, and will not include days of
 the previous month.  Days of a month before week 1 have a
WEEK_OF_MONTH
of 0.
For example, if
getFirstDayOfWeek()
is
SUNDAY
and
getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()
is 4, then the first week of
 January 1998 is Sunday, January 4 through Saturday, January 10.  These days
 have a
WEEK_OF_MONTH
of 1.  Thursday, January 1 through
 Saturday, January 3 have a
WEEK_OF_MONTH
of 0.  If
getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()
is changed to 3, then January 1
 through January 3 have a
WEEK_OF_MONTH
of 1.
Default Fields Values

field
. Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its
 range and, as a result, the next larger field is incremented or
 decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range.
Add rule 2
. If a smaller field is expected to be
 invariant, but it is impossible for it to be equal to its
 prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after
field
is changed, then its value is adjusted to be as close
 as possible to its expected value. A smaller field represents a
 smaller unit of time.
HOUR
is a smaller field than
DAY_OF_MONTH
. No adjustment is made to smaller fields
 that are not expected to be invariant. The calendar system
 determines what fields are expected to be invariant.
Specified by:
add
in class
Calendar
Parameters:
field
- the calendar field.
amount
- the amount of date or time to be added to the field.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
field
is
ZONE_OFFSET
,

, or unknown,
 or if any calendar fields have out-of-range values in
 non-lenient mode.

roll
public
void
roll
(int field,
 boolean up)
Adds or subtracts (up/down) a single unit of time on the given time
 field without changing larger fields.
Example
: Consider a
GregorianCalendar
originally set to December 31, 1999. Calling
roll(Calendar.MONTH, true)
sets the calendar to January 31, 1999.  The
YEAR
field is unchanged
 because it is a larger field than
MONTH
.
Specified by:
roll
in class
Calendar
Parameters:
field
- the time field.
up
- indicates if the value of the specified calendar field is to be
 rolled up or rolled down. Use
true
if rolling up,
false
otherwise.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
field
is
ZONE_OFFSET
,
DST_OFFSET
, or unknown,
 or if any calendar fields have out-of-range values in
 non-lenient mode.

add(int,int)
Calendar.set(int,int)
roll
public
void
roll
(int field,
 int amount)
Adds a signed amount to the specified calendar field without changing larger fields.
 A negative roll amount means to subtract from field without changing
 larger fields. If the specified amount is 0, this method performs nothing.
This method calls
Calendar.complete()
before adding the
 amount so that all the calendar fields are normalized. If there
 is any calendar field having an out-of-range value in non-lenient mode, then an
IllegalArgumentException
is thrown.
Example
: Consider a
GregorianCalendar
originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling
roll(Calendar.MONTH,
 8)
sets the calendar to April 30,
1999
. Using a
GregorianCalendar
, the
DAY_OF_MONTH
field cannot
 be 31 in the month April.
DAY_OF_MONTH
is set to the closest possible
 value, 30. The
YEAR
field maintains the value of 1999 because it
 is a larger field than
MONTH
.
Example
: Consider a
GregorianCalendar
originally set to Sunday June 6, 1999. Calling
roll(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)
sets the calendar to
 Tuesday June 1, 1999, whereas calling
add(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)
sets the calendar to
 Sunday May 30, 1999. This is because the roll rule imposes an
 additional constraint: The
MONTH
must not change when the
WEEK_OF_MONTH
is rolled. Taken together with add rule 1,
 the resultant date must be between Tuesday June 1 and Saturday June
 5. According to add rule 2, the
DAY_OF_WEEK
, an invariant
 when changing the
WEEK_OF_MONTH
, is set to Tuesday, the
 closest possible value to Sunday (where Sunday is the first day of the
 week).

methods.
For example, if the Gregorian change date is January 10,
 1970 and the date of this
GregorianCalendar
is
 January 20, 1970, the actual minimum value of the
DAY_OF_MONTH
field is 10 because the previous date
 of January 10, 1970 is December 27, 1996 (in the Julian
 calendar). Therefore, December 28, 1969 to January 9, 1970
 don't exist.

methods.
 For example, if the date of this instance is February 1, 2004,
 the actual maximum value of the
DAY_OF_MONTH
field
 is 29 because 2004 is a leap year, and if the date of this
 instance is February 1, 2005, it's 28.
This method calculates the maximum value of

 date specifiers -
weekYear
,
weekOfYear
, and
dayOfWeek
.
weekOfYear
follows the
WEEK_OF_YEAR

 the ISO 8601 standard, and that the
weekOfYear
numbering is compatible with the standard when
getFirstDayOfWeek()
is
MONDAY
and
getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

If
weekOfYear
is out of the valid week-of-year
 range in
weekYear

toZonedDateTime
()
Converts this object to a
ZonedDateTime
that represents
 the same point on the time-line as this
GregorianCalendar
.
Since this object supports a Julian-Gregorian cutover date and
ZonedDateTime
does not, it is possible that the resulting year,
 month and day will have different values.  The result will represent the
 correct date in the ISO calendar system, which will also be the same value
 for Modified Julian Days.
Returns:

zdt)
Obtains an instance of
GregorianCalendar
with the default locale
 from a
ZonedDateTime
object.
Since
ZonedDateTime
does not support a Julian-Gregorian cutover
 date and uses ISO calendar system, the return GregorianCalendar is a pure
 Gregorian calendar and uses ISO 8601 standard for week definitions,
 which has
MONDAY
as the
FirstDayOfWeek
and
4
as the value of the
MinimalDaysInFirstWeek
.
ZoneDateTime
can store points on the time-line further in the
 future and further in the past than
GregorianCalendar
. In this
 scenario, this method will throw an
IllegalArgumentException
exception.
Parameters:
zdt
- the zoned date-time object to convert
Returns:
the gregorian calendar representing the same point on the
  time-line as the zoned date-time provided
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
zdt
is null
IllegalArgumentException
- if the zoned date-time is too
 large to represent as a
GregorianCalendar
