A sequence of primitive long-valued elements supporting sequential and parallel
 aggregate operations.  This is the
long
primitive specialization of
Stream
.
The following example illustrates an aggregate operation using
Stream
and
LongStream
, computing the sum of the weights of the
 red widgets:
long sum = widgets.stream()
                       .filter(w -> w.getColor() == RED)
                       .mapToLong(w -> w.getWeight())
                       .sum();

Stream
and the package documentation
 for

Returns a stream consisting of the results of replacing each element of
 this stream with the contents of a mapped stream produced by applying
 the provided mapping function to each element.  Each mapped stream is
closed
after its contents
 have been placed into this stream.  (If a mapped stream is

Stream.flatMap(Function)
mapMulti
default
LongStream
mapMulti
(
LongStream.LongMapMultiConsumer
mapper)
Returns a stream consisting of the results of replacing each element of
 this stream with multiple elements, specifically zero or more elements.
 Replacement is performed by applying the provided mapping function to each
 element in conjunction with a
consumer
argument
 that accepts replacement elements. The mapping function calls the consumer
 zero or more times to provide the replacement elements.
This is an
intermediate
 operation
.
If the
consumer
argument is used outside the scope of
 its application to the mapping function, the results are undefined.
Implementation Requirements:
The default implementation invokes
flatMap
on this stream,
 passing a function that behaves as follows. First, it calls the mapper function
 with a
LongConsumer
that accumulates replacement elements into a newly created
 internal buffer. When the mapper function returns, it creates a
LongStream
from the
 internal buffer. Finally, it returns this stream to
flatMap
.
Parameters:
mapper
- a
non-interfering
,
stateless
function that generates replacement elements
Returns:
the new stream

Returns a stream consisting of the distinct elements of this stream.
This is a
stateful
 intermediate operation
.

sorted
LongStream
sorted
()

 order.
This is a

peek
LongStream
peek
(
LongConsumer
action)
Returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, additionally
 performing the provided action on each element as elements are consumed
 from the resulting stream.
This is an
intermediate
 operation
.
For parallel stream pipelines, the action may be called at
 whatever time and in whatever thread the element is made available by the
 upstream operation.  If the action modifies shared state,
 it is responsible for providing the required synchronization.
API Note:
This method exists mainly to support debugging, where you want
 to see the elements as they flow past a certain point in a pipeline:
LongStream.of(1, 2, 3, 4)
         .filter(e -> e > 2)
         .peek(e -> System.out.println("Filtered value: " + e))
         .map(e -> e * e)
         .peek(e -> System.out.println("Mapped value: " + e))
         .sum();
In cases where the stream implementation is able to optimize away the
 production of some or all the elements (such as with short-circuiting
 operations like
findFirst
, or in the example described in
count()
), the action will not be invoked for those elements.
Parameters:
action
- a
non-interfering
action to perform on the elements as
               they are consumed from the stream
Returns:
the new stream
limit
LongStream
limit
(long maxSize)
Returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, truncated
 to be no longer than
maxSize
in length.
This is a
short-circuiting
 stateful intermediate operation
.
API Note:
While
limit()
is generally a cheap operation on sequential
 stream pipelines, it can be quite expensive on ordered parallel pipelines,
 especially for large values of
maxSize
, since
limit(n)
is constrained to return not just any
n
elements, but the
first n
elements in the encounter order.  Using an unordered
 stream source (such as
generate(LongSupplier)
) or removing the
 ordering constraint with
BaseStream.unordered()
may result in significant
 speedups of
limit()
in parallel pipelines, if the semantics of
 your situation permit.  If consistency with encounter order is required,
 and you are experiencing poor performance or memory utilization with
limit()
in parallel pipelines, switching to sequential execution
 with
BaseStream.sequential()
may improve performance.
Parameters:
maxSize
- the number of elements the stream should be limited to
Returns:
the new stream
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
maxSize
is negative
skip
LongStream
skip
(long n)
Returns a stream consisting of the remaining elements of this stream
 after discarding the first
n
elements of the stream.
 If this stream contains fewer than
n
elements then an
 empty stream will be returned.
This is a
stateful
 intermediate operation
.
API Note:
While
skip()
is generally a cheap operation on sequential
 stream pipelines, it can be quite expensive on ordered parallel pipelines,
 especially for large values of
n
, since
skip(n)
is constrained to skip not just any
n
elements, but the
first n
elements in the encounter order.  Using an unordered
 stream source (such as
generate(LongSupplier)
) or removing the
 ordering constraint with
BaseStream.unordered()
may result in significant
 speedups of
skip()
in parallel pipelines, if the semantics of
 your situation permit.  If consistency with encounter order is required,
 and you are experiencing poor performance or memory utilization with
skip()
in parallel pipelines, switching to sequential execution
 with
BaseStream.sequential()
may improve performance.
Parameters:
n
- the number of leading elements to skip
Returns:
the new stream
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
n
is negative
takeWhile
default
LongStream
takeWhile
(
LongPredicate
predicate)
Returns, if this stream is ordered, a stream consisting of the longest
 prefix of elements taken from this stream that match the given predicate.
 Otherwise returns, if this stream is unordered, a stream consisting of a
 subset of elements taken from this stream that match the given predicate.
If this stream is ordered then the longest prefix is a contiguous
 sequence of elements of this stream that match the given predicate.  The
 first element of the sequence is the first element of this stream, and
 the element immediately following the last element of the sequence does
 not match the given predicate.
If this stream is unordered, and some (but not all) elements of this
 stream match the given predicate, then the behavior of this operation is
 nondeterministic; it is free to take any subset of matching elements
 (which includes the empty set).
Independent of whether this stream is ordered or unordered if all
 elements of this stream match the given predicate then this operation
 takes all elements (the result is the same as the input), or if no
 elements of the stream match the given predicate then no elements are
 taken (the result is an empty stream).
This is a
short-circuiting
 stateful intermediate operation
.
API Note:
While
takeWhile()
is generally a cheap operation on sequential
 stream pipelines, it can be quite expensive on ordered parallel
 pipelines, since the operation is constrained to return not just any
 valid prefix, but the longest prefix of elements in the encounter order.
 Using an unordered stream source (such as
generate(LongSupplier)
) or removing the ordering constraint with
BaseStream.unordered()
may result in significant speedups of
takeWhile()
in parallel pipelines, if the semantics of your
 situation permit.  If consistency with encounter order is required, and
 you are experiencing poor performance or memory utilization with
takeWhile()
in parallel pipelines, switching to sequential
 execution with
BaseStream.sequential()
may improve performance.
Implementation Requirements:
The default implementation obtains the
spliterator
of this stream, wraps that spliterator so as to support the semantics
 of this operation on traversal, and returns a new stream associated with
 the wrapped spliterator.  The returned stream preserves the execution
 characteristics of this stream (namely parallel or sequential execution
 as per
BaseStream.isParallel()
) but the wrapped spliterator may choose to
 not support splitting.  When the returned stream is closed, the close
 handlers for both the returned and this stream are invoked.
Parameters:
predicate
- a
non-interfering
,
stateless
predicate to apply to elements to determine the longest
                  prefix of elements.
Returns:
the new stream
Since:

dropWhile
default
LongStream
dropWhile
(
LongPredicate
predicate)
Returns, if this stream is ordered, a stream consisting of the remaining
 elements of this stream after dropping the longest prefix of elements
 that match the given predicate.  Otherwise returns, if this stream is
 unordered, a stream consisting of the remaining elements of this stream
 after dropping a subset of elements that match the given predicate.
If this stream is ordered then the longest prefix is a contiguous
 sequence of elements of this stream that match the given predicate.  The
 first element of the sequence is the first element of this stream, and
 the element immediately following the last element of the sequence does
 not match the given predicate.
If this stream is unordered, and some (but not all) elements of this
 stream match the given predicate, then the behavior of this operation is
 nondeterministic; it is free to drop any subset of matching elements
 (which includes the empty set).
Independent of whether this stream is ordered or unordered if all
 elements of this stream match the given predicate then this operation
 drops all elements (the result is an empty stream), or if no elements of
 the stream match the given predicate then no elements are dropped (the
 result is the same as the input).
This is a
stateful
 intermediate operation
.
API Note:
While
dropWhile()
is generally a cheap operation on sequential
 stream pipelines, it can be quite expensive on ordered parallel
 pipelines, since the operation is constrained to return not just any
 valid prefix, but the longest prefix of elements in the encounter order.
 Using an unordered stream source (such as
generate(LongSupplier)
) or removing the ordering constraint with
BaseStream.unordered()
may result in significant speedups of
dropWhile()
in parallel pipelines, if the semantics of your
 situation permit.  If consistency with encounter order is required, and
 you are experiencing poor performance or memory utilization with
dropWhile()
in parallel pipelines, switching to sequential
 execution with
BaseStream.sequential()
may improve performance.
Implementation Requirements:
The default implementation obtains the
spliterator
of this stream, wraps that spliterator so as to support the semantics
 of this operation on traversal, and returns a new stream associated with
 the wrapped spliterator.  The returned stream preserves the execution

Parameters:
predicate
- a
non-interfering
,
stateless
predicate to apply to elements to determine the longest
                  prefix of elements.
Returns:
the new stream
Since:
9
forEach
void
forEach
(
LongConsumer
action)
Performs an action for each element of this stream.
This is a
terminal
 operation
.
For parallel stream pipelines, this operation does
not
guarantee to respect the encounter order of the stream, as doing so
 would sacrifice the benefit of parallelism.  For any given element, the
 action may be performed at whatever time and in whatever thread the
 library chooses.  If the action accesses shared state, it is
 responsible for providing the required synchronization.
Parameters:
action
- a
non-interfering
action to perform on the elements
forEachOrdered
void
forEachOrdered
(
LongConsumer
action)
Performs an action for each element of this stream, guaranteeing that
 each element is processed in encounter order for streams that have a
 defined encounter order.
This is a
terminal
 operation
.
Parameters:
action
- a
non-interfering
action to perform on the elements
See Also:
forEach(LongConsumer)
toArray
long[]
toArray
()
Returns an array containing the elements of this stream.
This is a
terminal
 operation
.
Returns:
an array containing the elements of this stream
reduce
long
reduce
(long identity,
LongBinaryOperator
op)
Performs a
reduction
on the
 elements of this stream, using the provided identity value and an
associative
accumulation function, and returns the reduced value.  This is equivalent
 to:
long result = identity;
     for (long element : this stream)
         result = accumulator.applyAsLong(result, element)
     return result;
but is not constrained to execute sequentially.
The
identity
value must be an identity for the accumulator
 function. This means that for all
x
,
accumulator.apply(identity, x)
is equal to
x
.
 The
accumulator
function must be an
associative
function.
This is a
terminal
 operation
.
API Note:
Sum, min, max, and average are all special cases of reduction.
 Summing a stream of numbers can be expressed as:
long sum = integers.reduce(0, (a, b) -> a+b);
or more compactly:
long sum = integers.reduce(0, Long::sum);
While this may seem a more roundabout way to perform an aggregation
 compared to simply mutating a running total in a loop, reduction
 operations parallelize more gracefully, without needing additional
 synchronization and with greatly reduced risk of data races.
Parameters:
identity
- the identity value for the accumulating function
op
- an
associative
,
non-interfering
,
stateless
function for combining two values
Returns:
the result of the reduction

OptionalLong
reduce
(
LongBinaryOperator
op)
Performs a
reduction
on the
 elements of this stream, using an
associative
accumulation
 function, and returns an
OptionalLong
describing the reduced value,
 if any. This is equivalent to:
boolean foundAny = false;
     long result = null;
     for (long element : this stream) {
         if (!foundAny) {
             foundAny = true;
             result = element;
         }
         else
             result = accumulator.applyAsLong(result, element);
     }
     return foundAny ? OptionalLong.of(result) : OptionalLong.empty();
but is not constrained to execute sequentially.
The
accumulator
function must be an
associative
function.
This is a
terminal
 operation
.
Parameters:
op
- an
associative
,
non-interfering
,
stateless

Performs a
mutable
 reduction
operation on the elements of this stream.  A mutable
 reduction is one in which the reduced value is a mutable result container,
 such as an
ArrayList
, and elements are incorporated by updating
 the state of the result rather than by replacing the result.  This
 produces a result equivalent to:
R result = supplier.get();
     for (long element : this stream)
         accumulator.accept(result, element);
     return result;
Like
reduce(long, LongBinaryOperator)
,
collect
operations
 can be parallelized without requiring additional synchronization.
This is a
terminal
 operation
.
Type Parameters:
R
- the type of the mutable result container
Parameters:
supplier
- a function that creates a new mutable result container.
                 For a parallel execution, this function may be called
                 multiple times and must return a fresh value each time.
accumulator
- an
associative
,
non-interfering
,
stateless
function that must fold an element into a result
                    container.
combiner
- an
associative
,
non-interfering
,
stateless
function that accepts two partial result containers
                    and merges them, which must be compatible with the
                    accumulator function.  The combiner function must fold
                    the elements from the second result container into the
                    first result container.
Returns:
the result of the reduction

sum
long
sum
()
Returns the sum of elements in this stream.  This is a special case
 of a
reduction
and is equivalent to:
return reduce(0, Long::sum);
This is a
terminal
 operation
.
Returns:
the sum of elements in this stream
min
OptionalLong
min
()
Returns an
OptionalLong
describing the minimum element of this
 stream, or an empty optional if this stream is empty.  This is a special
 case of a
reduction
and is equivalent to:
return reduce(Long::min);
This is a
terminal operation
.
Returns:
an
OptionalLong
containing the minimum element of this
 stream, or an empty
OptionalLong
if the stream is empty
max
OptionalLong
max
()
Returns an
OptionalLong
describing the maximum element of this
 stream, or an empty optional if this stream is empty.  This is a special
 case of a
reduction
and is equivalent to:
return reduce(Long::max);
This is a
terminal
 operation
.
Returns:
an
OptionalLong
containing the maximum element of this
 stream, or an empty
OptionalLong
if the stream is empty
count
long
count
()
Returns the count of elements in this stream.  This is a special case of
 a
reduction
and is
 equivalent to:
return map(e -> 1L).sum();
This is a
terminal operation
.
API Note:
An implementation may choose to not execute the stream pipeline (either
 sequentially or in parallel) if it is capable of computing the count
 directly from the stream source.  In such cases no source elements will
 be traversed and no intermediate operations will be evaluated.
 Behavioral parameters with side-effects, which are strongly discouraged
 except for harmless cases such as debugging, may be affected.  For
 example, consider the following stream:
LongStream s = LongStream.of(1, 2, 3, 4);
     long count = s.peek(System.out::println).count();
The number of elements covered by the stream source is known and the
 intermediate operation,
peek
, does not inject into or remove
 elements from the stream (as may be the case for
flatMap
or
filter
operations).  Thus the count is 4 and there is no need to
 execute the pipeline and, as a side-effect, print out the elements.
Returns:
the count of elements in this stream
average
OptionalDouble
average
()
Returns an
OptionalDouble
describing the arithmetic mean of elements of
 this stream, or an empty optional if this stream is empty.  This is a
 special case of a
reduction
.
This is a
terminal
 operation
.
Returns:
an
OptionalDouble
containing the average element of this
 stream, or an empty optional if the stream is empty
summaryStatistics
LongSummaryStatistics
summaryStatistics
()
Returns a
LongSummaryStatistics
describing various summary data
 about the elements of this stream.  This is a special case of a
reduction
.
This is a
terminal
 operation
.
Returns:
a
LongSummaryStatistics
describing various summary data
 about the elements of this stream
anyMatch
boolean
anyMatch
(
LongPredicate
predicate)
Returns whether any elements of this stream match the provided
 predicate.  May not evaluate the predicate on all elements if not
 necessary for determining the result.  If the stream is empty then
false
is returned and the predicate is not evaluated.
This is a
short-circuiting
 terminal operation
.
API Note:
This method evaluates the
existential quantification
of the
 predicate over the elements of the stream (for some x P(x)).
Parameters:
predicate
- a
non-interfering
,
stateless
predicate to apply to elements of this stream
Returns:
true
if any elements of the stream match the provided
 predicate, otherwise
false
allMatch
boolean
allMatch
(
LongPredicate
predicate)
Returns whether all elements of this stream match the provided predicate.
 May not evaluate the predicate on all elements if not necessary for
 determining the result.  If the stream is empty then
true
is
 returned and the predicate is not evaluated.
This is a
short-circuiting
 terminal operation
.
API Note:
This method evaluates the
universal quantification
of the
 predicate over the elements of the stream (for all x P(x)).  If the
 stream is empty, the quantification is said to be
vacuously
 satisfied
and is always
true
(regardless of P(x)).
Parameters:
predicate
- a
non-interfering
,
stateless
predicate to apply to elements of this stream
Returns:
true
if either all elements of the stream match the
 provided predicate or the stream is empty, otherwise
false
noneMatch
boolean
noneMatch
(
LongPredicate
predicate)
Returns whether no elements of this stream match the provided predicate.
 May not evaluate the predicate on all elements if not necessary for
 determining the result.  If the stream is empty then
true
is
 returned and the predicate is not evaluated.
This is a
short-circuiting
 terminal operation
.
API Note:
This method evaluates the
universal quantification
of the
 negated predicate over the elements of the stream (for all x ~P(x)).  If
 the stream is empty, the quantification is said to be vacuously satisfied
 and is always
true
, regardless of P(x).
Parameters:
predicate
- a
non-interfering
,
stateless
predicate to apply to elements of this stream
Returns:
true
if either no elements of the stream match the
 provided predicate or the stream is empty, otherwise
false
findFirst
OptionalLong
findFirst
()
Returns an
OptionalLong
describing the first element of this
 stream, or an empty
OptionalLong
if the stream is empty.  If the
 stream has no encounter order, then any element may be returned.
This is a
short-circuiting
 terminal operation
.
Returns:
an
OptionalLong
describing the first element of this
 stream, or an empty
OptionalLong
if the stream is empty
findAny
OptionalLong
findAny
()
Returns an
OptionalLong
describing some element of the stream, or
 an empty
OptionalLong
if the stream is empty.
This is a
short-circuiting
 terminal operation
.
The behavior of this operation is explicitly nondeterministic; it is
 free to select any element in the stream.  This is to allow for maximal
 performance in parallel operations; the cost is that multiple invocations
 on the same source may not return the same result.  (If a stable result
 is desired, use
findFirst()
instead.)
Returns:
an
OptionalLong
describing some element of this stream,
 or an empty
OptionalLong
if the stream is empty

iterate
static
LongStream
iterate
(long seed,
LongUnaryOperator
f)
Returns an infinite sequential ordered
LongStream
produced by iterative
 application of a function
f
to an initial element
seed
,
 producing a
Stream
consisting of
seed
,
f(seed)
,
f(f(seed))
, etc.
The first element (position
0
) in the
LongStream
will
 be the provided
seed
.  For
n > 0
, the element at position
n
, will be the result of applying the function
f
to the
 element at position
n - 1
.
The action of applying
f
for one element
happens-before
the action of applying
f
for subsequent elements.  For any given
 element the action may be performed in whatever thread the library
 chooses.
Parameters:
seed
- the initial element
f
- a function to be applied to the previous element to produce
          a new element
Returns:
a new sequential
LongStream
iterate
static
LongStream
iterate
(long seed,
LongPredicate
hasNext,
LongUnaryOperator
next)
Returns a sequential ordered
LongStream
produced by iterative
 application of the given
next
function to an initial element,
 conditioned on satisfying the given
hasNext
predicate.  The
 stream terminates as soon as the
hasNext
predicate returns false.
LongStream.iterate
should produce the same sequence of elements as
 produced by the corresponding for-loop:
for (long index=seed; hasNext.test(index); index = next.applyAsLong(index)) {
         ...
     }
The resulting sequence may be empty if the
hasNext
predicate
 does not hold on the seed value.  Otherwise the first element will be the
 supplied
seed
value, the next element (if present) will be the
 result of applying the
next
function to the
seed
value,
 and so on iteratively until the
hasNext
predicate indicates that
 the stream should terminate.
The action of applying the
hasNext
predicate to an element
happens-before
the action of applying the
next
function to that element.  The
 action of applying the
next
function for one element
happens-before
the action of applying the
hasNext
predicate for subsequent elements.  For any given element an action may
 be performed in whatever thread the library chooses.
Parameters:
seed
- the initial element
hasNext
- a predicate to apply to elements to determine when the
                stream must terminate.
next
- a function to be applied to the previous element to produce
             a new element

An equivalent sequence of increasing values can be produced
 sequentially using a
for
loop as follows:
for (long i = startInclusive; i <= endInclusive ; i++) { ... }
Parameters:

concat
static
LongStream
concat
(
LongStream
a,
LongStream
b)
Creates a lazily concatenated stream whose elements are all the
 elements of the first stream followed by all the elements of the
 second stream.  The resulting stream is ordered if both
 of the input streams are ordered, and parallel if either of the input
 streams is parallel.  When the resulting stream is closed, the close
 handlers for both input streams are invoked.
This method operates on the two input streams and binds each stream
 to its source.  As a result subsequent modifications to an input stream
 source may not be reflected in the concatenated stream result.
API Note:
To preserve optimization opportunities this method binds each stream to
 its source and accepts only two streams as parameters.  For example, the
 exact size of the concatenated stream source can be computed if the exact
 size of each input stream source is known.
 To concatenate more streams without binding, or without nested calls to
 this method, try creating a stream of streams and flat-mapping with the
 identity function, for example:
LongStream concat = Stream.of(s1, s2, s3, s4).flatMapToLong(s -> s);
Implementation Note:
Use caution when constructing streams from repeated concatenation.
 Accessing an element of a deeply concatenated stream can result in deep
 call chains, or even
StackOverflowError
.
Parameters:
a
- the first stream
b
- the second stream
Returns:
the concatenation of the two input streams
