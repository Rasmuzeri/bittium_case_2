Interface DoubleStream.Builder
All Superinterfaces:
DoubleConsumer
Enclosing interface:
DoubleStream
public static interface
DoubleStream.Builder
extends
DoubleConsumer
A mutable builder for a
DoubleStream
.
A stream builder has a lifecycle, which starts in a building
 phase, during which elements can be added, and then transitions to a built
 phase, after which elements may not be added.  The built phase
 begins when the
build()
method is called, which creates an
 ordered stream whose elements are the elements that were added to the
 stream builder, in the order they were added.
Since:
1.8
