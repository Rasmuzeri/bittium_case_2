Enum Constant Summary
Enum Constants
Enum Constant
Description
CONCURRENT
Indicates that this collector is
concurrent
, meaning that
 the result container can support the accumulator function being
 called concurrently with the same result container from multiple
 threads.
IDENTITY_FINISH
Indicates that the finisher function is the identity function and
 can be elided.
UNORDERED
Indicates that the collection operation does not commit to preserving
 the encounter order of input elements.

Enum Constant Details
CONCURRENT
public static final
Collector.Characteristics
CONCURRENT
Indicates that this collector is
concurrent
, meaning that
 the result container can support the accumulator function being
 called concurrently with the same result container from multiple
 threads.
If a
CONCURRENT
collector is not also
UNORDERED
,
 then it should only be evaluated concurrently if applied to an
 unordered data source.
UNORDERED
public static final
Collector.Characteristics
UNORDERED
Indicates that the collection operation does not commit to preserving
 the encounter order of input elements.  (This might be true if the
 result container has no intrinsic order, such as a
Set
.)
IDENTITY_FINISH
public static final
Collector.Characteristics
IDENTITY_FINISH
Indicates that the finisher function is the identity function and
 can be elided.  If set, it must be the case that an unchecked cast
 from A to R will succeed.

Collector.Characteristics
valueOf
(
String
name)
Returns the enum constant of this class with the specified name.
The string must match
exactly
an identifier used to declare an
enum constant in this class.  (Extraneous whitespace characters are 
not permitted.)
Parameters:
name
- the name of the enum constant to be returned.
Returns:
the enum constant with the specified name
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if this enum class has no constant with the specified name
NullPointerException
- if the argument is null
