Interface IntStream.Builder
All Superinterfaces:
IntConsumer
Enclosing interface:
IntStream
public static interface
IntStream.Builder
extends
IntConsumer
A mutable builder for an
IntStream
.
A stream builder has a lifecycle, which starts in a building
 phase, during which elements can be added, and then transitions to a built
 phase, after which elements may not be added.  The built phase
 begins when the
build()
method is called, which creates an
 ordered stream whose elements are the elements that were added to the
 stream builder, in the order they were added.
Since:
1.8
