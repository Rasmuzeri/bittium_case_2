Method Details
nextLong
long
nextLong
()
Returns the next
long
element in the iteration.
Returns:
the next
long
element in the iteration
Throws:
NoSuchElementException
- if the iteration has no more elements
forEachRemaining
default
void
forEachRemaining
(
LongConsumer
action)
Performs the given action for each remaining element until all elements
 have been processed or the action throws an exception.  Actions are
 performed in the order of iteration, if that order is specified.
 Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the caller.
The behavior of an iterator is unspecified if the action modifies the
 source of elements in any way (even by calling the
remove
method or other mutator methods of
Iterator
subtypes),
 unless an overriding class has specified a concurrent modification policy.
Subsequent behavior of an iterator is unspecified if the action throws an
 exception.
Specified by:
forEachRemaining
in interface
PrimitiveIterator
<
Long
,
LongConsumer
>
Implementation Requirements:
The default implementation behaves as if:
while (hasNext())
         action.accept(nextLong());
Parameters:
action
- The action to be performed for each element
next
default
Long
next
()
Returns the next element in the iteration.
Specified by:
next
in interface
Iterator
<
Long
>
Implementation Requirements:
The default implementation boxes the result of calling
nextLong()
, and returns that boxed result.
Returns:
the next element in the iteration
forEachRemaining
default
void
forEachRemaining
(
Consumer
<? super
Long
> action)
Performs the given action for each remaining element until all elements
 have been processed or the action throws an exception.  Actions are
 performed in the order of iteration, if that order is specified.
 Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the caller.
The behavior of an iterator is unspecified if the action modifies the
 collection in any way (even by calling the
remove
method
 or other mutator methods of
Iterator
subtypes),
 unless an overriding class has specified a concurrent modification policy.
Subsequent behavior of an iterator is unspecified if the action throws an
 exception.
Specified by:
forEachRemaining
in interface
Iterator
<
Long
>
Implementation Requirements:
If the action is an instance of
LongConsumer
then it is cast
 to
LongConsumer
and passed to
forEachRemaining(java.util.function.LongConsumer)
;
 otherwise the action is adapted to an instance of
LongConsumer
, by boxing the argument of
LongConsumer
,
 and then passed to
forEachRemaining(java.util.function.LongConsumer)
.
Parameters:
action
- The action to be performed for each element
