Method Details
tryAdvance
default
boolean
tryAdvance
(
Consumer
<? super
Long
> action)
If a remaining element exists: performs the given action on it,
 returning
true
; else returns
false
.  If this
 Spliterator is
Spliterator.ORDERED
the action is performed on the
 next element in encounter order.  Exceptions thrown by the
 action are relayed to the caller.
Subsequent behavior of a spliterator is unspecified if the action throws
 an exception.
Specified by:
tryAdvance
in interface
Spliterator
<
Long
>
Implementation Requirements:
If the action is an instance of
LongConsumer
then it is cast
 to
LongConsumer
and passed to
Spliterator.OfPrimitive.tryAdvance(java.util.function.LongConsumer)
; otherwise
 the action is adapted to an instance of
LongConsumer
, by
 boxing the argument of
LongConsumer
, and then passed to
Spliterator.OfPrimitive.tryAdvance(java.util.function.LongConsumer)
.
Parameters:
action
- The action whose operation is performed at-most once
Returns:
false
if no remaining elements existed
 upon entry to this method, else
true
.
forEachRemaining
default
void
forEachRemaining
(
Consumer
<? super
Long
> action)
Performs the given action for each remaining element, sequentially in
 the current thread, until all elements have been processed or the action
 throws an exception.  If this Spliterator is
Spliterator.ORDERED
, actions
 are performed in encounter order.  Exceptions thrown by the action
 are relayed to the caller.
Subsequent behavior of a spliterator is unspecified if the action throws
 an exception.
Specified by:
forEachRemaining
in interface
Spliterator
<
Long
>
Implementation Requirements:
If the action is an instance of
LongConsumer
then it is cast
 to
LongConsumer
and passed to
Spliterator.OfPrimitive.forEachRemaining(java.util.function.LongConsumer)
; otherwise
 the action is adapted to an instance of
LongConsumer
, by
 boxing the argument of
LongConsumer
, and then passed to
Spliterator.OfPrimitive.forEachRemaining(java.util.function.LongConsumer)
.
Parameters:
