java.util.regex
Classes for matching character sequences against patterns specified
 by regular expressions.
An instance of the
Pattern
class
 represents a regular expression that is specified in string form in
 a syntax similar to that used by Perl.
Instances of the
Matcher
class are used
 to match character sequences against a given pattern.  Input is
 provided to matchers via the
CharSequence
interface in order to support matching against characters from a
 wide variety of input sources.
Unless otherwise noted, passing a
null
argument to a
 method in any class or interface in this package will cause a
NullPointerException
to be
 thrown.
