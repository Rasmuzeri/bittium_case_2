Interface ResourceBundleControlProvider
public interface
ResourceBundleControlProvider
An interface for service providers that provide implementations of
ResourceBundle.Control
. The
default resource bundle loading
 behavior
of the
ResourceBundle.getBundle
factory methods that take
 no
ResourceBundle.Control
instance can be modified with
ResourceBundleControlProvider
implementations.
Provider implementations are loaded from the application's class path
 using
ServiceLoader
at the first invocation of the
ResourceBundle.getBundle
factory method that takes no
ResourceBundle.Control
instance.
All
ResourceBundleControlProvider
s are ignored in named modules.
Since:
1.8
