Constructs a new Manifest that is a copy of the specified Manifest.
Parameters:

- the Manifest to copy
Method Details
getMainAttributes
public
Attributes
getMainAttributes
()
Returns the main Attributes for the Manifest.
Returns:
the main Attributes for the Manifest
getEntries
public
Map
<
String
,
Attributes
>
getEntries
()
Returns a Map of the entries contained in this Manifest. Each entry
 is represented by a String name (key) and associated Attributes (value).
 The Map permits the
null
key, but no entry with a null key is
 created by
read(java.io.InputStream)
, nor is such an entry written by using
write(java.io.OutputStream)
.
Returns:
a Map of the entries contained in this Manifest
getAttributes
public
Attributes
getAttributes
(
String
name)
Returns the Attributes for the specified entry name.
 This method is defined as:
return (Attributes)getEntries().get(name)
Though
null
is a valid
name
, when
getAttributes(null)
is invoked on a
Manifest
obtained from a jar file,
null
will be returned.  While jar
 files themselves do not allow
null
-named attributes, it is
 possible to invoke
getEntries()
on a
Manifest
, and
 on that result, invoke
put
with a null key and an
 arbitrary value.  Subsequent invocations of
getAttributes(null)
will return the just-
put
value.
Note that this method does not return the manifest's main attributes;
 see
getMainAttributes()
.
Parameters:
name
- entry name
Returns:
the Attributes for the specified entry name
clear
public
void
clear
()
Clears the main Attributes as well as the entries in this Manifest.
write
public
void
write
(
OutputStream
out)
throws
IOException
Writes the Manifest to the specified OutputStream.
 Attributes.Name.MANIFEST_VERSION must be set in
 MainAttributes prior to invoking this method.
Parameters:
out
- the output stream
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error has occurred

getMainAttributes()
read
public
void
read
(
InputStream
is)
throws
IOException
Reads the Manifest from the specified InputStream. The entry
 names and attributes read will be merged in with the current
 manifest entries.
Parameters:
is
- the input stream
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error has occurred
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
o)
Returns true if the specified Object is also a Manifest and has
 the same main Attributes and entries.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
o
- the object to be compared
Returns:
true if the specified Object is also a Manifest and has
 the same main Attributes and entries

HashMap
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Returns the hash code for this Manifest.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
a hash code value for this object.
See Also:
Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)
clone
public
Object
clone
()
Returns a shallow copy of this Manifest.  The shallow copy is
 implemented as follows:
public Object clone() { return new Manifest(this); }
Overrides:
