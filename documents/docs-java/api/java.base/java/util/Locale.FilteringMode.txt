This enum provides constants to select a filtering mode for locale
 matching. Refer to
RFC 4647
 Matching of Language Tags
for details.
As an example, think of two Language Priority Lists each of which
 includes only one language range and a set of following language tags:
de (German)
    de-DE (German, Germany)
    de-Deva (German, in Devanagari script)
    de-Deva-DE (German, in Devanagari script, Germany)
    de-DE-1996 (German, Germany, orthography of 1996)
    de-Latn-DE (German, in Latin script, Germany)
    de-Latn-DE-1996 (German, in Latin script, Germany, orthography of 1996)
The filtering method will behave as follows:

Performs
basic

because
 nothing matches.
MAP_EXTENDED_RANGES
Same as above.
Performs
basic
filtering and returns
"de-DE"
and

because
"de-*-DE"
is mapped to
"de-DE"
.
REJECT_EXTENDED_RANGES
Same as above.
Throws
IllegalArgumentException
because
"de-*-DE"
is
 not a valid basic language range.

Description
AUTOSELECT_FILTERING
Specifies automatic filtering mode based on the given Language
 Priority List consisting of language ranges.
EXTENDED_FILTERING
Specifies extended filtering.
IGNORE_EXTENDED_RANGES
Specifies basic filtering: Note that any extended language ranges
 included in the given Language Priority List are ignored.
MAP_EXTENDED_RANGES
Specifies basic filtering: If any extended language ranges are
 included in the given Language Priority List, they are mapped to the
 basic language range.
REJECT_EXTENDED_RANGES
Specifies basic filtering: If any extended language ranges are
 included in the given Language Priority List, the list is rejected
 and the filtering method throws
IllegalArgumentException

AUTOSELECT_FILTERING
public static final
Locale.FilteringMode
AUTOSELECT_FILTERING
Specifies automatic filtering mode based on the given Language
 Priority List consisting of language ranges. If all of the ranges
 are basic, basic filtering is selected. Otherwise, extended
 filtering is selected.
EXTENDED_FILTERING
public static final
Locale.FilteringMode
EXTENDED_FILTERING
Specifies extended filtering.
IGNORE_EXTENDED_RANGES
public static final
Locale.FilteringMode
IGNORE_EXTENDED_RANGES
Specifies basic filtering: Note that any extended language ranges
 included in the given Language Priority List are ignored.
MAP_EXTENDED_RANGES
public static final
Locale.FilteringMode
MAP_EXTENDED_RANGES
Specifies basic filtering: If any extended language ranges are
 included in the given Language Priority List, they are mapped to the
 basic language range. Specifically, a language range starting with a
 subtag
"*"
is treated as a language range
"*"
. For
 example,
"*-US"
is treated as
"*"
. If
"*"
is
 not the first subtag,
"*"
and extra
"-"
are removed.
 For example,
"ja-*-JP"
is mapped to
"ja-JP"
.
REJECT_EXTENDED_RANGES
public static final
Locale.FilteringMode
REJECT_EXTENDED_RANGES
Specifies basic filtering: If any extended language ranges are
 included in the given Language Priority List, the list is rejected
 and the filtering method throws
IllegalArgumentException
.
