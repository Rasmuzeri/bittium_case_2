Class AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
java.lang.Object
java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractOwnableSynchronizer
java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public abstract class
AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
extends
AbstractOwnableSynchronizer
implements
Serializable
Provides a framework for implementing blocking locks and related
 synchronizers (semaphores, events, etc) that rely on
 first-in-first-out (FIFO) wait queues.  This class is designed to
 be a useful basis for most kinds of synchronizers that rely on a
 single atomic
int
value to represent state. Subclasses
 must define the protected methods that change this state, and which
 define what that state means in terms of this object being acquired
 or released.  Given these, the other methods in this class carry
 out all queuing and blocking mechanics. Subclasses can maintain
 other state fields, but only the atomically updated
int
value manipulated using methods
getState()
,
setState(int)
and
compareAndSetState(int, int)
is tracked with respect
 to synchronization.
Subclasses should be defined as non-public internal helper
 classes that are used to implement the synchronization properties
 of their enclosing class.  Class
AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
does not implement any
 synchronization interface.  Instead it defines methods such as
acquireInterruptibly(int)
that can be invoked as
 appropriate by concrete locks and related synchronizers to
 implement their public methods.
This class supports either or both a default
exclusive
mode and a
shared
mode. When acquired in exclusive mode,
 attempted acquires by other threads cannot succeed. Shared mode
 acquires by multiple threads may (but need not) succeed. This class
 does not "understand" these differences except in the
 mechanical sense that when a shared mode acquire succeeds, the next
 waiting thread (if one exists) must also determine whether it can
 acquire as well. Threads waiting in the different modes share the
 same FIFO queue. Usually, implementation subclasses support only
 one of these modes, but both can come into play for example in a
ReadWriteLock
. Subclasses that support only exclusive or
 only shared modes need not define the methods supporting the unused mode.
This class defines a nested
AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject
class that
 can be used as a
Condition
implementation by subclasses
 supporting exclusive mode for which method
isHeldExclusively()
reports whether synchronization is exclusively
 held with respect to the current thread, method
release(int)
invoked with the current
getState()
value fully releases
 this object, and
acquire(java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.Node, int, boolean, boolean, boolean, long)
, given this saved state value,
 eventually restores this object to its previous acquired state.  No
AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
method otherwise creates such a
 condition, so if this constraint cannot be met, do not use it.  The
 behavior of
AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject
depends of course on the
 semantics of its synchronizer implementation.
This class provides inspection, instrumentation, and monitoring
 methods for the internal queue, as well as similar methods for
 condition objects. These can be exported as desired into classes
 using an
AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
for their
 synchronization mechanics.
Serialization of this class stores only the underlying atomic
 integer maintaining state, so deserialized objects have empty
 thread queues. Typical subclasses requiring serializability will
 define a
readObject
method that restores this to a known
 initial state upon deserialization.
Usage
To use this class as the basis of a synchronizer, redefine the
 following methods, as applicable, by inspecting and/or modifying
 the synchronization state using
getState()
,
setState(int)
and/or
compareAndSetState(int, int)
:
tryAcquire(int)
tryRelease(int)
tryAcquireShared(int)
tryReleaseShared(int)
isHeldExclusively()
Each of these methods by default throws
UnsupportedOperationException
.  Implementations of these methods
 must be internally thread-safe, and should in general be short and
 not block. Defining these methods is the
only
supported
 means of using this class. All other methods are declared
final
because they cannot be independently varied.
You may also find the inherited methods from
AbstractOwnableSynchronizer
useful to keep track of the thread
 owning an exclusive synchronizer.  You are encouraged to use them
 -- this enables monitoring and diagnostic tools to assist users in
 determining which threads hold locks.
Even though this class is based on an internal FIFO queue, it
 does not automatically enforce FIFO acquisition policies.  The core
 of exclusive synchronization takes the form:
Acquire:
while (!tryAcquire(arg)) {
enqueue thread if it is not already queued
;
possibly block current thread
;
     }
Release:
if (tryRelease(arg))
unblock the first queued thread
;
(Shared mode is similar but may involve cascading signals.)
Because checks in acquire are invoked before
 enqueuing, a newly acquiring thread may
barge
ahead of
 others that are blocked and queued.  However, you can, if desired,
 define
tryAcquire
and/or
tryAcquireShared
to
 disable barging by internally invoking one or more of the inspection
 methods, thereby providing a
fair
FIFO acquisition order.
 In particular, most fair synchronizers can define
tryAcquire
to return
false
if
hasQueuedPredecessors()
(a method
 specifically designed to be used by fair synchronizers) returns
true
.  Other variations are possible.
Throughput and scalability are generally highest for the
 default barging (also known as
greedy
,
renouncement
, and
convoy-avoidance
) strategy.
 While this is not guaranteed to be fair or starvation-free, earlier
 queued threads are allowed to recontend before later queued
 threads, and each recontention has an unbiased chance to succeed
 against incoming threads.  Also, while acquires do not
 "spin" in the usual sense, they may perform multiple
 invocations of
tryAcquire
interspersed with other
 computations before blocking.  This gives most of the benefits of
 spins when exclusive synchronization is only briefly held, without
 most of the liabilities when it isn't. If so desired, you can
 augment this by preceding calls to acquire methods with
 "fast-path" checks, possibly prechecking
hasContended()
and/or
hasQueuedThreads()
to only do so if the synchronizer
 is likely not to be contended.
This class provides an efficient and scalable basis for
 synchronization in part by specializing its range of use to
 synchronizers that can rely on
int
state, acquire, and
 release parameters, and an internal FIFO wait queue. When this does
 not suffice, you can build synchronizers from a lower level using
atomic
classes, your own custom
Queue
classes, and
LockSupport
blocking
 support.
Usage Examples
Here is a non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock class that uses
 the value zero to represent the unlocked state, and one to
 represent the locked state. While a non-reentrant lock
 does not strictly require recording of the current owner
 thread, this class does so anyway to make usage easier to monitor.
 It also supports conditions and exposes some instrumentation methods:
class Mutex implements Lock, java.io.Serializable {

   // Our internal helper class
   private static class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer {
     // Acquires the lock if state is zero
     public boolean tryAcquire(int acquires) {
       assert acquires == 1; // Otherwise unused
       if (compareAndSetState(0, 1)) {
         setExclusiveOwnerThread(Thread.currentThread());
         return true;
       }
       return false;
     }

     // Releases the lock by setting state to zero
     protected boolean tryRelease(int releases) {
       assert releases == 1; // Otherwise unused
       if (!isHeldExclusively())
         throw new IllegalMonitorStateException();
       setExclusiveOwnerThread(null);
       setState(0);
       return true;
     }

     // Reports whether in locked state
     public boolean isLocked() {
       return getState() != 0;
     }

     public boolean isHeldExclusively() {
       // a data race, but safe due to out-of-thin-air guarantees
       return getExclusiveOwnerThread() == Thread.currentThread();
     }

     // Provides a Condition
     public Condition newCondition() {
       return new ConditionObject();
     }

     // Deserializes properly
     private void readObject(ObjectInputStream s)
         throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
       s.defaultReadObject();
       setState(0); // reset to unlocked state
     }
   }

   // The sync object does all the hard work. We just forward to it.
   private final Sync sync = new Sync();

   public void lock()              { sync.acquire(1); }
   public boolean tryLock()        { return sync.tryAcquire(1); }
   public void unlock()            { sync.release(1); }
   public Condition newCondition() { return sync.newCondition(); }
   public boolean isLocked()       { return sync.isLocked(); }
   public boolean isHeldByCurrentThread() {
     return sync.isHeldExclusively();
   }
   public boolean hasQueuedThreads() {
     return sync.hasQueuedThreads();
   }
   public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
     sync.acquireInterruptibly(1);
   }
   public boolean tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
       throws InterruptedException {
     return sync.tryAcquireNanos(1, unit.toNanos(timeout));
   }
 }
Here is a latch class that is like a
CountDownLatch
except that it only requires a single
signal
to
 fire. Because a latch is non-exclusive, it uses the
shared
acquire and release methods.
class BooleanLatch {

   private static class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer {
     boolean isSignalled() { return getState() != 0; }

     protected int tryAcquireShared(int ignore) {
       return isSignalled() ? 1 : -1;
     }

     protected boolean tryReleaseShared(int ignore) {
       setState(1);
       return true;
     }
   }

   private final Sync sync = new Sync();
   public boolean isSignalled() { return sync.isSignalled(); }
   public void signal()         { sync.releaseShared(1); }
   public void await() throws InterruptedException {
     sync.acquireSharedInterruptibly(1);
   }
 }

tryAcquire
protected
boolean
tryAcquire
(int arg)
Attempts to acquire in exclusive mode. This method should query
 if the state of the object permits it to be acquired in the
 exclusive mode, and if so to acquire it.
This method is always invoked by the thread performing
 acquire.  If this method reports failure, the acquire method
 may queue the thread, if it is not already queued, until it is
 signalled by a release from some other thread. This can be used
 to implement method
Lock.tryLock()
.
The default
 implementation throws
UnsupportedOperationException
.
Parameters:
arg
- the acquire argument. This value is always the one
        passed to an acquire method, or is the value saved on entry
        to a condition wait.  The value is otherwise uninterpreted
        and can represent anything you like.
Returns:
true
if successful. Upon success, this object has
         been acquired.
Throws:
IllegalMonitorStateException
- if acquiring would place this
         synchronizer in an illegal state. This exception must be
         thrown in a consistent fashion for synchronization to work
         correctly.
UnsupportedOperationException
- if exclusive mode is not supported
tryRelease
protected
boolean
tryRelease
(int arg)
Attempts to set the state to reflect a release in exclusive
 mode.
This method is always invoked by the thread performing release.
The default implementation throws
UnsupportedOperationException
.
Parameters:
arg
- the release argument. This value is always the one
        passed to a release method, or the current state value upon
        entry to a condition wait.  The value is otherwise
        uninterpreted and can represent anything you like.
Returns:
true
if this object is now in a fully released
         state, so that any waiting threads may attempt to acquire;
         and
false
otherwise.
Throws:
IllegalMonitorStateException
- if releasing would place this
         synchronizer in an illegal state. This exception must be
         thrown in a consistent fashion for synchronization to work
         correctly.
UnsupportedOperationException
- if exclusive mode is not supported
tryAcquireShared
protected
int
tryAcquireShared
(int arg)
Attempts to acquire in shared mode. This method should query if
 the state of the object permits it to be acquired in the shared
 mode, and if so to acquire it.
This method is always invoked by the thread performing
 acquire.  If this method reports failure, the acquire method
 may queue the thread, if it is not already queued, until it is
 signalled by a release from some other thread.
The default implementation throws
UnsupportedOperationException
.
Parameters:
arg
- the acquire argument. This value is always the one
        passed to an acquire method, or is the value saved on entry
        to a condition wait.  The value is otherwise uninterpreted
        and can represent anything you like.
Returns:
a negative value on failure; zero if acquisition in shared
         mode succeeded but no subsequent shared-mode acquire can
         succeed; and a positive value if acquisition in shared
         mode succeeded and subsequent shared-mode acquires might
         also succeed, in which case a subsequent waiting thread
         must check availability. (Support for three different
         return values enables this method to be used in contexts
         where acquires only sometimes act exclusively.)  Upon
         success, this object has been acquired.
Throws:
IllegalMonitorStateException
- if acquiring would place this
         synchronizer in an illegal state. This exception must be
         thrown in a consistent fashion for synchronization to work
         correctly.
UnsupportedOperationException
- if shared mode is not supported
tryReleaseShared
protected
boolean
tryReleaseShared
(int arg)
Attempts to set the state to reflect a release in shared mode.
This method is always invoked by the thread performing release.
The default implementation throws
UnsupportedOperationException
.
Parameters:
arg
- the release argument. This value is always the one
        passed to a release method, or the current state value upon
        entry to a condition wait.  The value is otherwise
        uninterpreted and can represent anything you like.
Returns:
true
if this release of shared mode may permit a
         waiting acquire (shared or exclusive) to succeed; and
false
otherwise
Throws:
IllegalMonitorStateException
- if releasing would place this
         synchronizer in an illegal state. This exception must be
         thrown in a consistent fashion for synchronization to work
         correctly.
UnsupportedOperationException
- if shared mode is not supported
isHeldExclusively
protected
boolean
isHeldExclusively
()
Returns
true
if synchronization is held exclusively with
 respect to the current (calling) thread.  This method is invoked
 upon each call to a
AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject
method.
The default implementation throws
UnsupportedOperationException
. This method is invoked
 internally only within
AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject
methods, so need
 not be defined if conditions are not used.
Returns:
true
if synchronization is held exclusively;
false
otherwise

- if the current thread is interrupted
releaseShared
public final
boolean
releaseShared
(int arg)
Releases in shared mode.  Implemented by unblocking one or more
 threads if
tryReleaseShared(int)
returns true.
Parameters:
arg
- the release argument.  This value is conveyed to
tryReleaseShared(int)
but is otherwise uninterpreted
        and can represent anything you like.
Returns:
the value returned from
tryReleaseShared(int)
hasQueuedThreads
public final
boolean
hasQueuedThreads
()
Queries whether any threads are waiting to acquire. Note that
 because cancellations due to interrupts and timeouts may occur
 at any time, a
true
return does not guarantee that any
 other thread will ever acquire.
Returns:
true
if there may be other threads waiting to acquire
hasContended
public final
boolean
hasContended
()
Queries whether any threads have ever contended to acquire this
 synchronizer; that is, if an acquire method has ever blocked.
In this implementation, this operation returns in
 constant time.
Returns:
true
if there has ever been contention
getFirstQueuedThread
public final
Thread
getFirstQueuedThread
()
Returns the first (longest-waiting) thread in the queue, or
null
if no threads are currently queued.
In this implementation, this operation normally returns in
 constant time, but may iterate upon contention if other threads are
 concurrently modifying the queue.
Returns:
the first (longest-waiting) thread in the queue, or
null
if no threads are currently queued
isQueued
public final
boolean
isQueued
(
Thread
thread)
Returns true if the given thread is currently queued.
This implementation traverses the queue to determine
 presence of the given thread.
Parameters:
thread
- the thread
Returns:
true
if the given thread is on the queue
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if the thread is null
hasQueuedPredecessors
public final
boolean
hasQueuedPredecessors
()
Queries whether any threads have been waiting to acquire longer
 than the current thread.
An invocation of this method is equivalent to (but may be
 more efficient than):
getFirstQueuedThread() != Thread.currentThread()
   && hasQueuedThreads()
Note that because cancellations due to interrupts and
 timeouts may occur at any time, a
true
return does not
 guarantee that some other thread will acquire before the current
 thread.  Likewise, it is possible for another thread to win a
 race to enqueue after this method has returned
false
,
 due to the queue being empty.
This method is designed to be used by a fair synchronizer to
 avoid
barging
.
 Such a synchronizer's
tryAcquire(int)
method should return
false
, and its
tryAcquireShared(int)
method should
 return a negative value, if this method returns
true
(unless this is a reentrant acquire).  For example, the
tryAcquire
method for a fair, reentrant, exclusive mode
 synchronizer might look like this:
protected boolean tryAcquire(int arg) {
   if (isHeldExclusively()) {
     // A reentrant acquire; increment hold count
     return true;
   } else if (hasQueuedPredecessors()) {
     return false;
   } else {
     // try to acquire normally
   }
 }
Returns:
true
if there is a queued thread preceding the
         current thread, and
false
if the current thread
         is at the head of the queue or the queue is empty

getQueueLength
public final
int
getQueueLength
()
Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting to
 acquire.  The value is only an estimate because the number of
 threads may change dynamically while this method traverses
 internal data structures.  This method is designed for use in
 monitoring system state, not for synchronization control.
Returns:
the estimated number of threads waiting to acquire
getQueuedThreads
public final
Collection
<
Thread
>
getQueuedThreads
()
Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to
 acquire.  Because the actual set of threads may change
 dynamically while constructing this result, the returned
 collection is only a best-effort estimate.  The elements of the
 returned collection are in no particular order.  This method is
 designed to facilitate construction of subclasses that provide
 more extensive monitoring facilities.
Returns:
the collection of threads
getExclusiveQueuedThreads
public final
Collection
<
Thread
>
getExclusiveQueuedThreads
()
Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to
 acquire in exclusive mode. This has the same properties
 as
getQueuedThreads()
except that it only returns
 those threads waiting due to an exclusive acquire.
Returns:
the collection of threads
getSharedQueuedThreads
public final
Collection
<
Thread
>
getSharedQueuedThreads
()
Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to
 acquire in shared mode. This has the same properties
 as
getQueuedThreads()
except that it only returns
 those threads waiting due to a shared acquire.
Returns:
the collection of threads
toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns a string identifying this synchronizer, as well as its state.
 The state, in brackets, includes the String
"State ="
followed by the current value of
getState()
, and either
"nonempty"
or
"empty"
depending on whether the
 queue is empty.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
a string identifying this synchronizer, as well as its state
owns
public final
boolean
owns
(
AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject
condition)
Queries whether the given ConditionObject
 uses this synchronizer as its lock.
Parameters:
condition
- the condition
Returns:
true
if owned
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if the condition is null
hasWaiters
public final
boolean
hasWaiters
(
AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject
condition)
Queries whether any threads are waiting on the given condition
 associated with this synchronizer. Note that because timeouts
 and interrupts may occur at any time, a
true
return
 does not guarantee that a future
signal
will awaken
 any threads.  This method is designed primarily for use in
 monitoring of the system state.
Parameters:
condition
- the condition
Returns:
true
if there are any waiting threads
Throws:
IllegalMonitorStateException
- if exclusive synchronization
         is not held
IllegalArgumentException
- if the given condition is
         not associated with this synchronizer
NullPointerException
- if the condition is null
getWaitQueueLength
public final
int
getWaitQueueLength
(
AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject
condition)
Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting on the
 given condition associated with this synchronizer. Note that
 because timeouts and interrupts may occur at any time, the
 estimate serves only as an upper bound on the actual number of
 waiters.  This method is designed for use in monitoring system
 state, not for synchronization control.
Parameters:
condition
- the condition
Returns:
the estimated number of waiting threads
Throws:
IllegalMonitorStateException
- if exclusive synchronization
         is not held
IllegalArgumentException
- if the given condition is
         not associated with this synchronizer
NullPointerException
- if the condition is null
getWaitingThreads
public final
Collection
<
Thread
>
getWaitingThreads
(
AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject
condition)
Returns a collection containing those threads that may be
 waiting on the given condition associated with this
 synchronizer.  Because the actual set of threads may change
 dynamically while constructing this result, the returned
 collection is only a best-effort estimate. The elements of the
 returned collection are in no particular order.
Parameters:
condition
- the condition
Returns:
the collection of threads
Throws:
IllegalMonitorStateException
- if exclusive synchronization
         is not held
IllegalArgumentException
- if the given condition is
         not associated with this synchronizer
NullPointerException
- if the condition is null
