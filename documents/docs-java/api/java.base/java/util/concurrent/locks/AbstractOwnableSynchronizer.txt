public abstract class
AbstractOwnableSynchronizer
extends

implements
Serializable
A synchronizer that may be exclusively owned by a thread.  This
 class provides a basis for creating locks and related synchronizers
 that may entail a notion of ownership.  The
AbstractOwnableSynchronizer
class itself does not manage or
 use this information. However, subclasses and tools may use
 appropriately maintained values to help control and monitor access
 and provide diagnostics.
