Class ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy
java.lang.Object
java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy
All Implemented Interfaces:
RejectedExecutionHandler
Enclosing class:
ThreadPoolExecutor
public static class
ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy
extends
Object
implements
RejectedExecutionHandler
A handler for rejected tasks that discards the oldest unhandled
 request and then retries
execute
, unless the executor
 is shut down, in which case the task is discarded. This policy is
 rarely useful in cases where other threads may be waiting for
 tasks to terminate, or failures must be recorded. Instead consider
 using a handler of the form:
new RejectedExecutionHandler() {
   public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e) {
     Runnable dropped = e.getQueue().poll();
     if (dropped instanceof Future<?>) {
       ((Future<?>)dropped).cancel(false);
       // also consider logging the failure
     }
     e.execute(r);  // retry
 }}
