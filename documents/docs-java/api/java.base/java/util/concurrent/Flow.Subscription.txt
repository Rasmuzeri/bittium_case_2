Interface Flow.Subscription
Enclosing class:
Flow
public static interface
Flow.Subscription
Message control linking a
Flow.Publisher
and
Flow.Subscriber
.  Subscribers receive items only when requested,
 and may cancel at any time. The methods in this interface are
 intended to be invoked only by their Subscribers; usages in
 other contexts have undefined effects.

Method Details
request
void
request
(long n)
Adds the given number
n
of items to the current
 unfulfilled demand for this subscription.  If
n
is
 less than or equal to zero, the Subscriber will receive an
onError
signal with an
IllegalArgumentException
argument.  Otherwise, the
 Subscriber will receive up to
n
additional
onNext
invocations (or fewer if terminated).
Parameters:
n
- the increment of demand; a value of
Long.MAX_VALUE
may be considered as effectively unbounded
cancel
void
cancel
()
Causes the Subscriber to (eventually) stop receiving
 messages.  Implementation is best-effort -- additional
 messages may be received after invoking this method.
 A cancelled subscription need not ever receive an
onComplete
or
onError
signal.
