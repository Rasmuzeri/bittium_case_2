 it is relayed to the caller of the method (for example
execute
) causing attempted thread creation. If this
 method returns null or throws an exception, it is not
 retried until the next attempted creation (for example
 another call to
execute
).

the new worker thread, or
null
if the request
         to create a thread is rejected
