Interface ThreadFactory
public interface
ThreadFactory
An object that creates new threads on demand.  Using thread factories
 removes hardwiring of calls to
new Thread
,
 enabling applications to use special thread subclasses, priorities, etc.
The simplest implementation of this interface is just:
class SimpleThreadFactory implements ThreadFactory {
   public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
     return new Thread(r);
   }
 }
The
Executors.defaultThreadFactory()
method provides a more
 useful simple implementation, that sets the created thread context
 to known values before returning it.
Since:
1.5
