Class AtomicLongFieldUpdater<T>
java.lang.Object
java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLongFieldUpdater<T>
Type Parameters:
T
- The type of the object holding the updatable field
public abstract class
AtomicLongFieldUpdater<T>
extends
Object
A reflection-based utility that enables atomic updates to
 designated
volatile long
fields of designated classes.
 This class is designed for use in atomic data structures in which
 several fields of the same node are independently subject to atomic
 updates.
Note that the guarantees of the
compareAndSet
method in this class are weaker than in other atomic classes.
 Because this class cannot ensure that all uses of the field
 are appropriate for purposes of atomic access, it can
 guarantee atomicity only with respect to other invocations of
compareAndSet
and
set
on the same updater.
Object arguments for parameters of type
T
that are not
 instances of the class passed to
newUpdater(java.lang.Class<U>, java.lang.String)
will result in
 a
ClassCastException
being thrown.

Method Details
newUpdater
public static
<U>
AtomicLongFieldUpdater
<U>
newUpdater
(
Class
<U> tclass,
String
fieldName)
Creates and returns an updater for objects with the given field.
 The Class argument is needed to check that reflective types and
 generic types match.
Type Parameters:
U
- the type of instances of tclass
Parameters:
tclass
- the class of the objects holding the field
fieldName
- the name of the field to be updated
Returns:
the updater
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if the field is not a
 volatile long type
RuntimeException
- with a nested reflection-based
 exception if the class does not hold field or is the wrong type,
 or the field is inaccessible to the caller according to Java language
 access control
compareAndSet
public abstract
boolean
compareAndSet
(
T
obj,
 long expect,
 long update)
Atomically sets the field of the given object managed by this updater
 to the given updated value if the current value
==
the
 expected value. This method is guaranteed to be atomic with respect to
 other calls to
compareAndSet
and
set
, but not
 necessarily with respect to other changes in the field.
Parameters:
obj
- An object whose field to conditionally set
expect
- the expected value
update
- the new value
Returns:
true
if successful
weakCompareAndSet
public abstract
boolean
weakCompareAndSet
(
T
obj,
 long expect,
 long update)
Atomically sets the field of the given object managed by this updater
 to the given updated value if the current value
==
the
 expected value. This method is guaranteed to be atomic with respect to
 other calls to
compareAndSet
and
set
, but not
 necessarily with respect to other changes in the field.
This operation may fail spuriously and does not provide
 ordering guarantees, so is only rarely an appropriate
 alternative to
compareAndSet
.
Parameters:
obj
- An object whose field to conditionally set
expect
- the expected value
update
- the new value
Returns:
true
if successful
set
public abstract
void
set
(
T
obj,
 long newValue)
Sets the field of the given object managed by this updater to the
 given updated value. This operation is guaranteed to act as a volatile
 store with respect to subsequent invocations of
compareAndSet
.
Parameters:
obj
- An object whose field to set
newValue
- the new value
lazySet
public abstract
void
lazySet
(
T

) the field of the given object managed
 by this updater with the results of applying the given function

 re-applied when attempted updates fail due to contention among
 threads.  The function is applied with the current value as its
 first argument, and the given update as the second argument.
Parameters:
obj
- An object whose field to get and set
x
- the update value
accumulatorFunction
- a side-effect-free function of two arguments

) the field of the given object managed
 by this updater with the results of applying the given function
 to the current and given values, returning the updated value.
 The function should be side-effect-free, since it may be
 re-applied when attempted updates fail due to contention among
 threads.  The function is applied with the current value as its
 first argument, and the given update as the second argument.
Parameters:
