All Implemented Interfaces:

public class
LongAccumulator
extends
Number
implements
Serializable
One or more variables that together maintain a running
long
value updated using a supplied function.  When updates (method
accumulate(long)
) are contended across threads, the set of variables
 may grow dynamically to reduce contention.  Method
get()
(or, equivalently,
longValue()
) returns the current value
 across the variables maintaining updates.
This class is usually preferable to
AtomicLong
when
 multiple threads update a common value that is used for purposes such
 as collecting statistics, not for fine-grained synchronization
 control.  Under low update contention, the two classes have similar
 characteristics. But under high contention, expected throughput of
 this class is significantly higher, at the expense of higher space
 consumption.
The order of accumulation within or across threads is not
 guaranteed and cannot be depended upon, so this class is only
 applicable to functions for which the order of accumulation does
 not matter. The supplied accumulator function should be
 side-effect-free, since it may be re-applied when attempted updates
 fail due to contention among threads. For predictable results, the
 accumulator function should be associative and commutative. The
 function is applied with an existing value (or identity) as one
 argument, and a given update as the other argument.  For example,
 to maintain a running maximum value, you could supply
Long::max
along with
Long.MIN_VALUE
as the identity.
Class
LongAdder
provides analogs of the functionality of
 this class for the common special case of maintaining counts and
 sums.  The call
new LongAdder()
is equivalent to
new
 LongAccumulator((x, y) -> x + y, 0L)
.
This class extends
Number
, but does
not
define
 methods such as
equals
,
hashCode
and
compareTo
because instances are expected to be mutated, and so are
 not useful as collection keys.

Constructor Details
LongAccumulator
public
LongAccumulator
(
LongBinaryOperator
accumulatorFunction,
 long identity)
Creates a new instance using the given accumulator function
 and identity element.
Parameters:
accumulatorFunction
- a side-effect-free function of two arguments
identity
- identity (initial value) for the accumulator function
Method Details
accumulate
public
void
accumulate
(long x)
Updates with the given value.
Parameters:
x
- the value
get
public
long
get
()
Returns the current value.  The returned value is
NOT
an atomic snapshot; invocation in the absence of concurrent
 updates returns an accurate result, but concurrent updates that
 occur while the value is being calculated might not be
 incorporated.
Returns:
the current value
reset
public
void
reset
()
Resets variables maintaining updates to the identity value.
 This method may be a useful alternative to creating a new
 updater, but is only effective if there are no concurrent
 updates.  Because this method is intrinsically racy, it should
 only be used when it is known that no threads are concurrently
 updating.
getThenReset
public
long
getThenReset
()
Equivalent in effect to
get()
followed by
reset()
. This method may apply for example during quiescent
 points between multithreaded computations.  If there are
 updates concurrent with this method, the returned value is
not
guaranteed to be the final value occurring before
 the reset.
Returns:
the value before reset
