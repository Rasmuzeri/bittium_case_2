SequencedSet<E>
extends
SequencedCollection
<E>,
Set
<E>
A collection that is both a
SequencedCollection
and a
Set
. As such,
 it can be thought of either as a
Set
that also has a well-defined
encounter order
, or as a
SequencedCollection
that also has unique elements.
This interface has the same requirements on the
equals
and
hashCode
methods as defined by
Set.equals
and
Set.hashCode
.
 Thus, a
Set
and a
SequencedSet
will compare equals if and only
 if they have equal elements, irrespective of ordering.
SequencedSet
defines the
reversed()
method, which provides a
 reverse-ordered
view
of this set. The only difference
 from the
SequencedCollection.reversed
method is
 that the return type of
SequencedSet.reversed
is
SequencedSet
.
This class is a member of the
Java Collections Framework
.

Method Details
reversed
SequencedSet
<
E
>
reversed
()
Returns a reverse-ordered
view
of this collection.
 The encounter order of elements in the returned view is the inverse of the encounter
 order of elements in this collection. The reverse ordering affects all order-sensitive
 operations, including those on the view collections of the returned view. If the collection
 implementation permits modifications to this view, the modifications "write through" to the
 underlying collection. Changes to the underlying collection might or might not be visible
 in this reversed view, depending upon the implementation.

Returns:
a reverse-ordered view of this collection, as a
SequencedSet
