java.util.zip
Provides classes for reading and writing the standard ZIP and GZIP file
 formats. Also includes classes for compressing and decompressing data using
 the DEFLATE compression algorithm, which is used by the ZIP and GZIP file
 formats. Additionally, there are utility classes for computing the CRC-32,
 CRC-32C and Adler-32 checksums of arbitrary input streams.
Package Specification
Info-ZIP Application Note 970311
- a detailed description of
         the Info-ZIP format upon which the
java.util.zip
classes
         are based.
An implementation may optionally support the
         ZIP64(tm) format extensions defined by the
PKWARE ZIP File Format Specification
. The ZIP64(tm) format
         extensions are used to overcome the size limitations of the
         original ZIP format.
APPENDIX D of
PKWARE ZIP File Format Specification
- Language Encoding Flag
         to encode ZIP entry filename and comment fields using UTF-8.
