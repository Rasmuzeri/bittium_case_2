 the "deflate" compression format. It is also used as the basis for other
 types of compression filters, such as GZIPOutputStream.

1.7
DeflaterOutputStream
public
DeflaterOutputStream
(
OutputStream
out,
Deflater
def,
 int size)
Creates a new output stream with the specified compressor and
 buffer size.
The new output stream instance is created as if by invoking
 the 4-argument constructor DeflaterOutputStream(out, def, size, false).
Parameters:
out
- the output stream
def
- the compressor ("deflater")
size
- the output buffer size
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if
size <= 0
DeflaterOutputStream
public
DeflaterOutputStream
(
OutputStream
out,
Deflater
def,
 boolean syncFlush)
Creates a new output stream with the specified compressor, flush
 mode and a default buffer size.
Parameters:
out
- the output stream
def
- the compressor ("deflater")
syncFlush
- if
true
the
flush()
method of this
        instance flushes the compressor with flush mode
Deflater.SYNC_FLUSH
before flushing the output
        stream, otherwise only flushes the output stream
Since:
1.7
DeflaterOutputStream
public
DeflaterOutputStream
(
OutputStream
out,
Deflater
def)
Creates a new output stream with the specified compressor and
 a default buffer size.
The new output stream instance is created as if by invoking
 the 3-argument constructor DeflaterOutputStream(out, def, false).
Parameters:
out
- the output stream
def
- the compressor ("deflater")
DeflaterOutputStream
public
DeflaterOutputStream
(
OutputStream
out,
 boolean syncFlush)
Creates a new output stream with a default compressor, a default
 buffer size and the specified flush mode.
Parameters:
out
- the output stream
syncFlush
- if
true
the
flush()
method of this
        instance flushes the compressor with flush mode
Deflater.SYNC_FLUSH
before flushing the output
        stream, otherwise only flushes the output stream
Since:
1.7
DeflaterOutputStream
public
DeflaterOutputStream
(
OutputStream
out)
Creates a new output stream with a default compressor and buffer size.
The new output stream instance is created as if by invoking
 the 2-argument constructor DeflaterOutputStream(out, false).
Parameters:
out
- the output stream
Method Details
write
public
void
write
(int b)
throws
IOException
Writes a byte to the compressed output stream. This method will
 block until the byte can be written.
Overrides:
write
in class
FilterOutputStream
Parameters:
b
- the byte to be written
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error has occurred
write
public
void
write
(byte[] b,
 int off,
 int len)
throws
IOException
Writes an array of bytes to the compressed output stream. This
 method will block until all the bytes are written.
Overrides:
write
in class
FilterOutputStream
Parameters:
b
- the data to be written
off
- the start offset of the data
len
- the length of the data
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error has occurred
See Also:
FilterOutputStream.write(int)
finish
public
void
finish
()
            throws
IOException
Finishes writing compressed data to the output stream without closing
 the underlying stream. Use this method when applying multiple filters
 in succession to the same output stream.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error has occurred
close
public
void
close
()
           throws
IOException
Writes remaining compressed data to the output stream and closes the
 underlying stream.
Specified by:
close
in interface
AutoCloseable
Specified by:

in interface
Closeable
Overrides:
close
in class
FilterOutputStream
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error has occurred
See Also:
FilterOutputStream.flush()
FilterOutputStream.out
deflate
protected
void
deflate
()
                throws
IOException
Writes next block of compressed data to the output stream.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error has occurred
flush
public
void
flush
()
           throws
IOException
Flushes the compressed output stream.

 If
syncFlush
is
true
when this compressed output stream is
 constructed, this method first flushes the underlying
compressor
with the flush mode
Deflater.SYNC_FLUSH
to force
 all pending data to be flushed out to the output stream and then
 flushes the output stream. Otherwise this method only flushes the
 output stream without flushing the
compressor
.
Specified by:
flush
in interface
Flushable
Overrides:
flush
in class
FilterOutputStream
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error has occurred
