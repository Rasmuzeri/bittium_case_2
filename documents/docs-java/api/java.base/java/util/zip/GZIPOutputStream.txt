Constructor Details
GZIPOutputStream
public
GZIPOutputStream
(
OutputStream
out,
 int size)
throws
IOException
Creates a new output stream with the specified buffer size.
The new output stream instance is created as if by invoking
 the 3-argument constructor GZIPOutputStream(out, size, false).
Parameters:
out
- the output stream
size
- the output buffer size
Throws:
IOException
- If an I/O error has occurred.
IllegalArgumentException
- if
size <= 0
GZIPOutputStream
public
GZIPOutputStream
(
OutputStream
out,
 int size,
 boolean syncFlush)
throws
IOException
Creates a new output stream with the specified buffer size and
 flush mode.
Parameters:
out
- the output stream
size
- the output buffer size
syncFlush
- if
true
invocation of the inherited
flush()
method of
        this instance flushes the compressor with flush mode
Deflater.SYNC_FLUSH
before flushing the output
        stream, otherwise only flushes the output stream
Throws:
IOException
- If an I/O error has occurred.
IllegalArgumentException
- if
size <= 0
Since:
1.7
GZIPOutputStream
public
GZIPOutputStream
(

The new output stream instance is created as if by invoking
 the 2-argument constructor GZIPOutputStream(out, false).
Parameters:
out
- the output stream
Throws:
IOException
- If an I/O error has occurred.
GZIPOutputStream

Method Details
write
public
void
write
(byte[] buf,
 int off,
 int len)
throws
IOException
Writes array of bytes to the compressed output stream. This method
 will block until all the bytes are written.
Overrides:
write
in class
DeflaterOutputStream
Parameters:
buf
- the data to be written
off
- the start offset of the data
len
- the length of the data
Throws:
IOException
- If an I/O error has occurred.

finish
public
void
finish
()
            throws
IOException
Finishes writing compressed data to the output stream without closing
 the underlying stream. Use this method when applying multiple filters
 in succession to the same output stream.
Overrides:
finish
in class
DeflaterOutputStream
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error has occurred
