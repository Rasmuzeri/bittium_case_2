Returns the provider type. There is no guarantee that this type is
 accessible or that it has a public no-args constructor. The
get()
method should be used to obtain the provider instance.
When a module declares that the provider class is created by a
 provider factory then this method returns the return type of its
 public static "
provider()
" method.
Returns:
The provider type

Returns an instance of the provider.

Supplier
<
S
>
Returns:
An instance of the provider.
Throws:
ServiceConfigurationError
- If the service provider cannot be instantiated, or in the
         case of a provider factory, the public static
         "
provider()
" method returns
null
or throws
         an error or exception. The
ServiceConfigurationError
will carry an appropriate cause where possible.
