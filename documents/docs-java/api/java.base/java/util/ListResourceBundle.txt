Class ListResourceBundle
java.lang.Object
java.util.ResourceBundle
java.util.ListResourceBundle
Direct Known Subclasses:
AccessibleResourceBundle
public abstract class
ListResourceBundle
extends
ResourceBundle
ListResourceBundle
is an abstract subclass of
ResourceBundle
that manages resources for a locale
 in a convenient and easy to use list. See
ResourceBundle
for
 more information about resource bundles in general.
Subclasses must override
getContents
and provide an array,
 where each item in the array is a pair of objects.
 The first element of each pair is the key, which must be a
String
, and the second element is the value associated with
 that key.
The following
example
shows two members of a resource
 bundle family with the base name "MyResources".
 "MyResources" is the default member of the bundle family, and
 "MyResources_fr" is the French member.
 These members are based on
ListResourceBundle
(a related
example
shows
 how you can add a bundle to this family that's based on a properties file).
 The keys in this example are of the form "s1" etc. The actual
 keys are entirely up to your choice, so long as they are the same as
 the keys you use in your program to retrieve the objects from the bundle.
 Keys are case-sensitive.

public class MyResources extends ListResourceBundle {
    protected Object[][] getContents() {
        return new Object[][] {
        // LOCALIZE THIS
            {"s1", "The disk \"{1}\" contains {0}."},  // MessageFormat pattern
            {"s2", "1"},                               // location of {0} in pattern
            {"s3", "My Disk"},                         // sample disk name
            {"s4", "no files"},                        // first ChoiceFormat choice
            {"s5", "one file"},                        // second ChoiceFormat choice
            {"s6", "{0,number} files"},                // third ChoiceFormat choice
            {"s7", "3 Mar 96"},                        // sample date
            {"s8", new Dimension(1,5)}                 // real object, not just string
        // END OF MATERIAL TO LOCALIZE
        };

            {"s4", "ne contient pas de fichiers"},     // first ChoiceFormat choice

subclass must be thread-safe
 if it's simultaneously used by multiple threads. The default implementations
 of the methods in this class are thread-safe.
