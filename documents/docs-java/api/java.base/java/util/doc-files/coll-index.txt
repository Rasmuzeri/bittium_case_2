The Collections Framework
The collections framework is a unified architecture for
representing and manipulating collections, enabling them to be
manipulated independently of the details of their representation.
It reduces programming effort while increasing performance. It
enables interoperability among unrelated APIs, reduces effort in
designing and learning new APIs, and fosters software reuse. The
framework is based on more than a dozen collection interfaces. It
includes implementations of these interfaces and algorithms to
manipulate them.
The documents in this section are non-normative portions of
the Java Platform, Standard Edition API Specification.
