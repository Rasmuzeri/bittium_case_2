Enclosing class:
Spliterators
public abstract static class
Spliterators.AbstractDoubleSpliterator
extends
Object
implements
Spliterator.OfDouble
An abstract
Spliterator.OfDouble
that implements
trySplit
to permit limited parallelism.
To implement a spliterator an extending class need only
 implement
tryAdvance
.  The extending class should override
forEachRemaining
if it can provide a more performant implementation.
API Note:
This class is a useful aid for creating a spliterator when it is not
 possible or difficult to efficiently partition elements in a manner
 allowing balanced parallel computation.
An alternative to using this class, that also permits limited
 parallelism, is to create a spliterator from an iterator
 (see
Spliterators.spliterator(java.util.PrimitiveIterator.OfDouble, long, int)
.
 Depending on the circumstances using an iterator may be easier or more
 convenient than extending this class. For example, if there is already an
 iterator available to use then there is no need to extend this class.

AbstractDoubleSpliterator
protected
AbstractDoubleSpliterator
(long est,
 int additionalCharacteristics)
Creates a spliterator reporting the given estimated size and
 characteristics.
Parameters:
est
- the estimated size of this spliterator if known, otherwise
Long.MAX_VALUE
.
additionalCharacteristics
- properties of this spliterator's
        source or elements.  If
SIZED
is reported then this
        spliterator will additionally report
SUBSIZED
.
Method Details
trySplit
public
Spliterator.OfDouble
trySplit
()
If this spliterator can be partitioned, returns a Spliterator
 covering elements, that will, upon return from this method, not
 be covered by this Spliterator.
If this Spliterator is
Spliterator.ORDERED
, the returned Spliterator
 must cover a strict prefix of the elements.
Unless this Spliterator covers an infinite number of elements,
 repeated calls to
trySplit()
must eventually return
null
.
 Upon non-null return:
the value reported for
estimateSize()
before splitting,
 must, after splitting, be greater than or equal to
estimateSize()
for this and the returned Spliterator; and
if this Spliterator is
SUBSIZED
, then
estimateSize()
for this spliterator before splitting must be equal to the sum of
estimateSize()
for this and the returned Spliterator after
 splitting.
This method may return
null
for any reason,
 including emptiness, inability to split after traversal has
 commenced, data structure constraints, and efficiency
 considerations.

 This implementation permits limited parallelism.
Specified by:
trySplit
in interface
Spliterator
<
Double
>
Returns:
a
Spliterator
covering some portion of the
 elements, or
null
if this spliterator cannot be split
estimateSize
public
long
estimateSize
()
Returns an estimate of the number of elements that would be
 encountered by a
Spliterator.forEachRemaining(java.util.function.Consumer<? super T>)
traversal, or returns
Long.MAX_VALUE
if infinite, unknown, or too expensive to compute.
If this Spliterator is
Spliterator.SIZED
and has not yet been partially
 traversed or split, or this Spliterator is
Spliterator.SUBSIZED
and has
 not yet been partially traversed, this estimate must be an accurate
 count of elements that would be encountered by a complete traversal.
 Otherwise, this estimate may be arbitrarily inaccurate, but must decrease
 as specified across invocations of
Spliterator.trySplit()
.
Specified by:
estimateSize
in interface
Spliterator
<
Double
>
Implementation Requirements:
This implementation returns the estimated size as reported when
 created and, if the estimate size is known, decreases in size when
 split.
Returns:
the estimated size, or
Long.MAX_VALUE
if infinite,
         unknown, or too expensive to compute.
characteristics
public
int
characteristics
()
Returns a set of characteristics of this Spliterator and its
 elements. The result is represented as ORed values from
Spliterator.ORDERED
,
Spliterator.DISTINCT
,
Spliterator.SORTED
,
Spliterator.SIZED
,
Spliterator.NONNULL
,
Spliterator.IMMUTABLE
,
Spliterator.CONCURRENT
,
Spliterator.SUBSIZED
.  Repeated calls to
characteristics()
on
 a given spliterator, prior to or in-between calls to
trySplit
,
 should always return the same result.
If a Spliterator reports an inconsistent set of
 characteristics (either those returned from a single invocation
 or across multiple invocations), no guarantees can be made
 about any computation using this Spliterator.
Specified by:
characteristics
in interface
Spliterator
<
Double
>
Implementation Requirements:
This implementation returns the characteristics as reported when
 created.
Returns:
a representation of characteristics
