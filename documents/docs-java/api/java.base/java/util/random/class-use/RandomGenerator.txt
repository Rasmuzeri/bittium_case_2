java.util.random.RandomGenerator
Packages that use
RandomGenerator
Package
Description
java.security
Provides the classes and interfaces for the security framework.
java.util
Contains the collections framework, some internationalization support classes,
 a service loader, properties, random number generation, string parsing
 and scanning classes, base64 encoding and decoding, a bit array, and
 several miscellaneous utility classes.
java.util.concurrent
Utility classes commonly useful in concurrent programming.
java.util.random
This package contains classes and interfaces that support a generic API
 for random number generation.

Subinterfaces of
RandomGenerator
in
java.util.random
Modifier and Type
Interface
Description
static interface
RandomGenerator.ArbitrarilyJumpableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate sequences of pseudorandom values and can easily
jump
forward, by an arbitrary amount, to a distant point in the state cycle.
static interface
RandomGenerator.JumpableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate pseudorandom values and can easily
jump
forward, by a
 moderate amount (ex. 2
64
) to a distant point in the state cycle.
static interface
RandomGenerator.LeapableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate sequences of pseudorandom values and can easily not only jump
 but also
leap
forward, by a large amount (ex. 2
128
), to
 a very distant point in the state cycle.
static interface
RandomGenerator.SplittableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate sequences of pseudorandom values and can be
split
into
 two objects (the original one and a new one) each of which obey that same
 protocol (and therefore can be recursively split indefinitely).
static interface
RandomGenerator.StreamableGenerator
The
RandomGenerator.StreamableGenerator
interface augments the
RandomGenerator
interface to provide methods that return streams
 of
RandomGenerator
objects.
