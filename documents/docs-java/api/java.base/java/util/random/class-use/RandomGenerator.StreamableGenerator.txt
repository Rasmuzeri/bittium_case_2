Uses of Interface
java.util.random.RandomGenerator.StreamableGenerator
Packages that use
RandomGenerator.StreamableGenerator
Package
Description
java.util
Contains the collections framework, some internationalization support classes,
 a service loader, properties, random number generation, string parsing
 and scanning classes, base64 encoding and decoding, a bit array, and
 several miscellaneous utility classes.
java.util.random
This package contains classes and interfaces that support a generic API
 for random number generation.

Class
Description
final class
SplittableRandom
A generator of uniform pseudorandom values (with period 2
64
)
 applicable for use in (among other contexts) isolated parallel
 computations that may generate subtasks.

Modifier and Type
Interface
Description
static interface
RandomGenerator.ArbitrarilyJumpableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate sequences of pseudorandom values and can easily
jump
forward, by an arbitrary amount, to a distant point in the state cycle.
static interface
RandomGenerator.JumpableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate pseudorandom values and can easily
jump
forward, by a
 moderate amount (ex. 2
64
) to a distant point in the state cycle.
static interface
RandomGenerator.LeapableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate sequences of pseudorandom values and can easily not only jump
 but also
leap
forward, by a large amount (ex. 2
128
), to
 a very distant point in the state cycle.
static interface
RandomGenerator.SplittableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate sequences of pseudorandom values and can be
split
into
 two objects (the original one and a new one) each of which obey that same
 protocol (and therefore can be recursively split indefinitely).
