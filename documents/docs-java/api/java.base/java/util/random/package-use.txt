Uses of Package
java.util.random
Packages that use
java.util.random
Package
Description
java.security
Provides the classes and interfaces for the security framework.
java.util
Contains the collections framework, some internationalization support classes,
 a service loader, properties, random number generation, string parsing
 and scanning classes, base64 encoding and decoding, a bit array, and
 several miscellaneous utility classes.
java.util.concurrent
Utility classes commonly useful in concurrent programming.
java.util.random
This package contains classes and interfaces that support a generic API
 for random number generation.

Class
Description
RandomGenerator
The
RandomGenerator
interface is designed to provide a common
 protocol for objects that generate random or (more typically) pseudorandom
 sequences of numbers (or Boolean values).

Description
RandomGenerator
The
RandomGenerator
interface is designed to provide a common
 protocol for objects that generate random or (more typically) pseudorandom
 sequences of numbers (or Boolean values).
RandomGenerator.SplittableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate sequences of pseudorandom values and can be
split
into
 two objects (the original one and a new one) each of which obey that same
 protocol (and therefore can be recursively split indefinitely).
RandomGenerator.StreamableGenerator
The
RandomGenerator.StreamableGenerator
interface augments the
RandomGenerator
interface to provide methods that return streams
 of
RandomGenerator
objects.

interface is designed to provide a common
 protocol for objects that generate random or (more typically) pseudorandom
 sequences of numbers (or Boolean values).
RandomGenerator.ArbitrarilyJumpableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate sequences of pseudorandom values and can easily
jump
forward, by an arbitrary amount, to a distant point in the state cycle.
RandomGenerator.JumpableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate pseudorandom values and can easily
jump
forward, by a
 moderate amount (ex. 2
64
) to a distant point in the state cycle.
RandomGenerator.LeapableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate sequences of pseudorandom values and can easily not only jump
 but also
leap
forward, by a large amount (ex. 2
128
), to
 a very distant point in the state cycle.
RandomGenerator.SplittableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate sequences of pseudorandom values and can be
split
into
 two objects (the original one and a new one) each of which obey that same
 protocol (and therefore can be recursively split indefinitely).
RandomGenerator.StreamableGenerator
The
RandomGenerator.StreamableGenerator
interface augments the
RandomGenerator
interface to provide methods that return streams
 of
RandomGenerator
objects.
RandomGeneratorFactory
This is a factory class for generating multiple random number generators
 of a specific
algorithm
