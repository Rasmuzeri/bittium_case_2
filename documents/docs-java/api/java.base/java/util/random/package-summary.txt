Package java.util.random
package
java.util.random
This package contains classes and interfaces that support a generic API
 for random number generation.
These classes and interfaces support the definition and use of "random
 generators", a term covering what have traditionally been called "random
 number generators" as well as generators of other sorts of randomly chosen
 values (eg. booleans). These classes and interfaces cover not only
 deterministic (pseudorandom) algorithms but also generators of values that
 use some "truly random" physical source (stochastic algorithms perhaps making
 use of thermal noise, for example, or quantum-mechanical effects).
The principal interface is
RandomGenerator
, which provides
 methods for requesting individual values of type
int
,
long
,
float
,
double
, or
boolean
chosen pseudorandomly
 from a uniform distribution; methods for requesting values of type
double
chosen pseudorandomly from a normal distribution or from an
 exponential distribution; and methods for creating streams of values of type
int
,
long
, or
double
chosen pseudorandomly from a
 uniform distribution (such streams are spliterator-based, allowing for
 parallel processing of their elements). There are also static factory methods
 for creating an instance of a specific random number generator algorithm
 given its name.
The principal supporting class is
RandomGeneratorFactory
. This
 can be used to generate multiple random number generators for a specific
 algorithm.
RandomGeneratorFactory
also provides methods for
 selecting random number generator algorithms. RandomGeneratorFactory
 registers implementations of
RandomGenerator
interface using the
 service provider API.
An important subsidiary interface is
RandomGenerator.StreamableGenerator
, which provides methods for
 creating spliterator-based streams of
RandomGenerator
objects,
 allowing for parallel processing of these objects using multiple threads.
 Unlike
Random
, most implementations of
RandomGenerator
are
not
thread-safe. The intent is that
 instances should not be shared among threads; rather, each thread should have
 its own random generator(s) to use. The various pseudorandom algorithms
 provided by this package are designed so that multiple instances will (with
 very high probability) behave as if statistically independent.
For many purposes, these are the only two interfaces that a consumer of
 pseudorandom values will need. There are also some more specialized
 interfaces that describe more specialized categories of random number
 generators
SplittableGenerator
,
JumpableGenerator
,
LeapableGenerator
, and
ArbitrarilyJumpableGenerator
that have specific strategies for creating statistically independent instances.
Using the Random Number Generator Interfaces
To get started, an application should first create one instance of a
 generator class. Assume that the contents of the package
java.util.random
has been imported:
import java.util.random.*;
Then one can choose a specific implementation by giving the name of a generator
 algorithm to the static method
RandomGenerator.of(java.lang.String)
, in which case the
 no-arguments constructor for that implementation is used:
RandomGenerator g = RandomGenerator.of("L64X128MixRandom");
For a single-threaded application, this is all that is needed. One can then
 invoke methods of
g
such as
nextLong()
,
nextInt()
,
nextFloat()
,
nextDouble()
and
nextBoolean()
to generate individual
 randomly chosen values. One can also use the methods
ints()
,
longs()
and
doubles()
to create streams of randomly
 chosen values. The methods
nextGaussian()
and
nextExponential()
draw floating-point
 values from nonuniform distributions.
For a multi-threaded application, one can repeat the preceding steps
 to create additional
RandomGenerators
, but
 often it is preferable to use methods of the one single initially
 created generator to create others like it. (One reason is that some
 generator algorithms, if asked to create a new set of generators all at
 once, can make a special effort to ensure that the new generators are
 statistically independent.) If the initial generator implements the
 interface
RandomGenerator.StreamableGenerator
, then the method
rngs()
can be used to
 create a stream of generators. If this is a parallel stream, then it is
 easy to get parallel execution by using the
map()
method on the stream.
For a multi-threaded application that forks new threads dynamically,
 another approach is to use an initial generator that implements the interface
RandomGenerator.SplittableGenerator
, which is then considered to
 "belong" to the initial thread for its exclusive use; then whenever any
 thread needs to fork a new thread, it first uses the
split()
method of its own
 generator to create a new generator, which is then passed to the newly
 created thread for exclusive use by that new thread.
Choosing a Random Number Generator Algorithm
There are three groups of random number generator algorithm provided
 in Java: the Legacy group, the LXM group, and the Xoroshiro/Xoshiro group.
The legacy group includes random number generators that existed
 before JDK 17: Random, ThreadLocalRandom, SplittableRandom, and
 SecureRandom. Random (LCG) is the weakest of the available algorithms, and it
 is recommended that users migrate to newer algorithms. If an application
 requires a random number generator algorithm that is cryptographically
 secure, then it should continue to use an instance of the class
SecureRandom
.
The algorithms in the LXM group are similar to each other. The parameters
 of each algorithm can be found in the algorithm name. The number after "L" indicates the
 number of state bits for the LCG subgenerator, and the number after "X" indicates the
 number of state bits for the XBG subgenerator. "Mix" indicates that
 the algorithm uses an 8-operation bit-mixing function; "StarStar" indicates use
 of a 3-operation bit-scrambler.
The algorithms in the Xoroshiro/Xoshiro group are more traditional algorithms
 (see David Blackman and Sebastiano Vigna, "Scrambled Linear Pseudorandom
 Number Generators," ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, 2021);
 the number in the name indicates the number of state bits.
For applications (such as physical simulation, machine learning, and
 games) that do not require a cryptographically secure algorithm, this package
 provides multiple implementations of interface
RandomGenerator
that
 provide trade-offs among speed, space, period, accidental correlation, and
 equidistribution properties.
For applications with no special requirements,
L64X128MixRandom
has a good balance among speed, space,
 and period, and is suitable for both single-threaded and multi-threaded
 applications when used properly (a separate instance for each thread).
If the application uses only a single thread, then
Xoroshiro128PlusPlus
is even smaller and faster, and
 certainly has a sufficiently long period.
For an application running in a 32-bit hardware environment and using
 only one thread or a small number of threads,
L32X64MixRandom
may be a good
 choice.
For an application that uses many threads that are allocated in one batch
 at the start of the computation, either a "jumpable" generator such as
Xoroshiro128PlusPlus
or
Xoshiro256PlusPlus
may be used, or a "splittable"
 generator such as
L64X128MixRandom
or
L64X256MixRandom
may be used.
For an application that creates many threads dynamically, perhaps through
 the use of spliterators, a "splittable" generator such as
L64X128MixRandom
or
L64X256MixRandom
is
 recommended. If the number of generators created dynamically may
 be very large (millions or more), then using generators such as
L128X128MixRandom
or
L128X256MixRandom
,
 which use a 128-bit parameter rather than a 64-bit parameter for their LCG
 subgenerator, will make it much less likely that two instances use the same
 state cycle.
For an application that uses tuples of consecutively generated values, it
 may be desirable to use a generator that is
k
-equidistributed such
 that
k
is at least as large as the length of the tuples being
 generated. The generator
L64X256MixRandom
is provably
 4-equidistributed, and
L64X1024MixRandom
is provably
 16-equidistributed.
For applications that generate large permutations, it may be best to use
 a generator whose period is much larger than the total number of possible
 permutations; otherwise it will be impossible to generate some of the
 intended permutations. For example, if the goal is to shuffle a deck of 52
 cards, the number of possible permutations is 52! (52 factorial), which is
 larger than 2
225
(but smaller than 2
226
), so it may be
 best to use a generator whose period at least 2
256
, such as
L64X256MixRandom
or
L64X1024MixRandom
or
L128X256MixRandom
or
L128X1024MixRandom
. (It is of course also necessary to
 provide sufficiently many seed bits when the generator is initialized, or
 else it will still be impossible to generate some of the intended
 permutations.)
Random Number Generator Algorithms Available
These algorithms [in the table below] must be found with the current version
 of Java SE. A particular JDK implementation may recognize additional
 algorithms; check the JDK's documentation for details. The set of algorithms
 required by Java SE may be updated by changes to the Java SE specification.
 Over time, new algorithms may be added and old algorithms may be removed.
In addition, as another life-cycle phase, an algorithm may be
deprecated
. A deprecated algorithm is
 not recommended for use. If a required algorithm is deprecated, it may be
 removed in a future release. Due to advances in random number generator
 algorithm development and analysis, an algorithm may be deprecated during the
 lifetime of a particular Java SE release. Changing the deprecation status of
 an algorithm is
not
a specification change.

Categories of Random Number Generator Algorithms
Historically, most pseudorandom generator algorithms have been based on some
 sort of finite-state machine with a single, large cycle of states; when it is
 necessary to have multiple threads use the same algorithm simultaneously, the
 usual technique is to arrange for each thread to traverse a different region
 of the state cycle. These regions may be doled out to threads by starting
 with a single initial state and then using a "jump function" that travels a
 long distance around the cycle (perhaps 2
64
steps or more); the
 jump function is applied repeatedly and sequentially, to identify widely
 spaced states that are then doled out, one to each thread, to serve as the
 initial state for the generator to be used by that thread. This strategy is
 supported by the interface
RandomGenerator.JumpableGenerator
.
 Sometimes it is desirable to support two levels of jumping (by long distances
 and by
really
long distances); this strategy is supported by the
 interface
RandomGenerator.LeapableGenerator
. In this package,
 implementations of this interface include "Xoroshiro128PlusPlus" and
 "Xoshiro256PlusPlus". There is also an interface
RandomGenerator.ArbitrarilyJumpableGenerator
for algorithms that allow
 jumping along the state cycle by any user-specified distance; there are currently
 no implementations of this interface in this package.
A more recent category of "splittable" pseudorandom generator algorithms
 uses a large family of state cycles and makes some attempt to ensure that
 distinct instances use different state cycles; but even if two instances
 "accidentally" use the same state cycle, they are highly likely to traverse
 different regions of that shared state cycle. This strategy is
 supported by the interface
RandomGenerator.SplittableGenerator
.
 In this package, implementations of this interface include
 "L32X64MixRandom",
 "L64X128StarStarRandom",
 "L64X128MixRandom",
 "L64X256MixRandom",
 "L64X1024MixRandom",
 "L128X128MixRandom",
 "L128X256MixRandom", and
 "L128X1024MixRandom"; note that the class
SplittableRandom
also implements this interface.
The LXM Family of Random Number Generator Algorithms
The structure of the central nextLong (or nextInt) method of an LXM
 algorithm follows a suggestion in December 2017 by Sebastiano Vigna
 that using one Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) as a first subgenerator
 and one Xor-Based Generator (XBG) as a second subgenerator (rather
 than using two LCG subgenerators) would provide a longer period, superior
 equidistribution, scalability, and better quality.  Each of the
 specific implementations here combines one of the best currently known
 XBG algorithms (xoroshiro128 or xoshiro256, described by Blackman and
 Vigna in "Scrambled Linear Pseudorandom Number Generators",
ACM Transactions
 on Mathematical Software
, 2021) with an LCG that uses one of the best
 currently known multipliers (found by a search for better multipliers
 in 2019 by Steele and Vigna, described in "Computationally Easy, Spectrally
 Good Multipliers for Congruential Pseudorandom Number Generators",
Software: Practice and Experience
(2021), doi:10.1002/spe.3030),
 and then applies either a mixing function identified by Doug Lea or
 or a simple scrambler proposed by Blackman and Vigna. Testing has
 confirmed that the LXM algorithm is far superior in quality to the
 SplitMix algorithm (2014) used by
SplittableRandom
(see Steele and Vigna, "LXM: Better Splittable Pseudorandom Number
 Generators (and Almost as Fast)",
Proc. 2021 ACM OOPSLA Conference
).

 Each class with a name of the form
L
p
X
q
SomethingRandom
uses some specific member of the LXM family of random number
 algorithms; "LXM" is short for "LCG, XBG, Mixer". Every LXM
 generator has two subgenerators; one is an LCG (Linear Congruential
 Generator) and the other is an XBG (Xor-Based Generator). Each output of an LXM
 generator is the result of combining state from the LCG with state from the
 XBG using a Mixing function (and then the state of the LCG
 and the state of the XBG are advanced).
The LCG subgenerator has an update step of the form
s = m*s + a
,
 where
s
,
m
, and
a
are all binary integers of the same
 size, each having
p
bits;
s
is the mutable state, the
 multiplier
m
is fixed (the same for all instances of a class) and the
 addend
a
is a parameter (a final field of the instance). The
 parameter
a
is required to be odd (this allows the LCG to have the
 maximal period, namely 2
p
); therefore there are
 2
p
−1
distinct choices of parameter. (When the size of
s
is 128 bits, then we use the name "
sh
" below to refer to
 the high half of
s
, that is, the high-order 64 bits of
s
.)
The XBG subgenerator can in principle be any one of a wide variety
 of XBG algorithms; in this package it is always either
xoroshiro128
,
xoshiro256
, or
xoroshiro1024
, in each
 case without any final scrambler (such as "+" or "**") because LXM uses
 a separate Mixer later in the process. The XBG state consists of
 some fixed number of
int
or
long
fields, generally named
x0
,
x1
, and so on, which can take on any values provided that
 they are not all zero. The collective total size of these fields is
q
bits; therefore the period of this subgenerator is
 2
q
−1.
Because the periods 2
p
and 2
q
−1
 of the two subgenerators are relatively prime, the
period
of any
 single instance of an LXM algorithm (the length of the series of generated
 values before it repeats) is the product of the periods of the subgenerators,
 that is, 2
p
(2
q
−1), which is just
 slightly smaller than 2
(
p
+
q
)
. Moreover, if two
 distinct instances of the same LXM algorithm have different
a
parameters, then their cycles of produced values will be different.
Generally speaking, among the "
L
p
X
q
"
 generators, the memory required for an instance is 2
p
+
q
bits.
 (If
q
is 1024 or larger, the XBG state is represented as an
 array, so additional bits are needed for the array object header, and another
 32 bits are used for an array index.)
Larger values of
p
imply a lower probability that two distinct
 instances will traverse the same state cycle, and larger values of
q
imply that the generator is equidistributed in a larger number of dimensions
 (this is provably true when
p
is 64, and conjectured to be
 approximately true when
p
is 128). A class with "
Mix
" in its
 name uses a fairly strong mixing function with excellent avalanche
 characteristics; a class with "
StarStar
" in its name uses a weaker
 but faster mixing function.
The specific LXM algorithms used in this package are all chosen so that
 the 64-bit values produced by the
nextLong()
method are exactly equidistributed (for example, for any specific instance of
 "L64X128MixRandom", over the course of its cycle each of the
 2
64
possible
long
values will be produced
 2
128
−1 times). The values produced by the
nextInt()
,
nextFloat()
, and
nextDouble()
methods are likewise exactly
 equidistributed. Some algorithms provide a further guarantee of
k
-equidistribution for some
k
greater than 1, meaning that successive
 non-overlapping
k
-tuples of 64-bit values produced by the
nextLong()
method are exactly
 equidistributed (equally likely to occur).
The following table gives the period, state size (in bits), parameter
 size (in bits, including the low-order bit that is required always to be a
 1-bit), and equidistribution property for each of the specific LXM algorithms
 used in this package.

For the algorithms listed above whose names begin with
L32
, the
 32-bit values produced by the
nextInt()
method are exactly equidistributed, but the 64-bit values produced by the
nextLong()
method are not exactly
 equidistributed.
For the algorithms listed above whose names begin with
L64
or
L128
, the 64-bit values produced by the
nextLong()
method are
exactly
 equidistributed
: every instance, over the course of its cycle, will
 produce each of the 2
64
possible
long
values exactly the
 same number of times. For example, any specific instance of
 "L64X256MixRandom", over the course of its cycle each of the
 2
64
possible
long
values will be produced
 2
256
−1 times. The values produced by the
nextInt()
,
nextFloat()
, and
nextDouble()
methods are likewise exactly
 equidistributed.
In addition, for the algorithms listed above whose names begin with
L64
, the 64-bit values produced by the
nextLong()
method are
k
-equidistributed (but not exactly
k
-equidistributed). To be
 precise, and taking "L64X256MixRandom" as an example: for
 any specific instance of "L64X256MixRandom", consider the
 (overlapping) length-4 subsequences of the cycle of 64-bit values produced by
nextLong()
(assuming no other methods are
 called that would affect the state). There are
 2
64
(2
256
−1) such subsequences, and each
 subsequence, which consists of 4 64-bit values, can have one of
 2
256
values. Of those 2
256
subsequence values, nearly
 all of them (2
256
−2
64
) occur 2
64
times
 over the course of the entire cycle, and the other 2
64
subsequence
 values occur only 2
64
−1 times. So the ratio of the
 probability of getting any specific one of the less common subsequence values
 and the probability of getting any specific one of the more common
 subsequence values is 1−2
-64
. (Note that the set of
 2
64
less-common subsequence values will differ from one instance
 of "L64X256MixRandom" to another, as a function of the
 additive parameter of the LCG.) The values produced by the
nextInt()
,
nextFloat()
, and
nextDouble()
methods are likewise
 4-equidistributed (but not exactly 4-equidistributed).
The next table gives the LCG multiplier value, the name of the specific
 XBG algorithm used, the specific numeric parameters for that XBG
 algorithm, and the mixing function for each of the specific LXM algorithms
 used in this package. (Note that the multiplier used for the 128-bit LCG
 cases is 65 bits wide, so the constant
0x1d605bbb58c8abbfdL
shown in
 the table cannot actually be used in code; instead, only the 64 low-order
 bits
0xd605bbb58c8abbfdL
are represented in the source code, and the
 missing 1-bit is handled through special coding of the multiply-add algorithm
 used in the LCG.)

Description
RandomGenerator
The
RandomGenerator
interface is designed to provide a common
 protocol for objects that generate random or (more typically) pseudorandom
 sequences of numbers (or Boolean values).
RandomGenerator.ArbitrarilyJumpableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate sequences of pseudorandom values and can easily
jump
forward, by an arbitrary amount, to a distant point in the state cycle.
RandomGenerator.JumpableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate pseudorandom values and can easily
jump
forward, by a
 moderate amount (ex. 2
64
) to a distant point in the state cycle.
RandomGenerator.LeapableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate sequences of pseudorandom values and can easily not only jump
 but also
leap
forward, by a large amount (ex. 2
128
), to
 a very distant point in the state cycle.
RandomGenerator.SplittableGenerator
This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 generate sequences of pseudorandom values and can be
split
into
 two objects (the original one and a new one) each of which obey that same
 protocol (and therefore can be recursively split indefinitely).
RandomGenerator.StreamableGenerator
The
RandomGenerator.StreamableGenerator
interface augments the
RandomGenerator
interface to provide methods that return streams
 of
RandomGenerator
objects.
RandomGeneratorFactory
<T extends
RandomGenerator
>
This is a factory class for generating multiple random number generators
 of a specific
algorithm
.
