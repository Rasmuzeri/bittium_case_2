The Thai Buddhist calendar system.
This chronology defines the rules of the Thai Buddhist calendar system.
 This calendar system is primarily used in Thailand.
 Dates are aligned such that
2484-01-01 (Buddhist)
is
1941-01-01 (ISO)
.
The fields are defined as follows:
era - There are two eras, the current 'Buddhist' (ERA_BE) and the previous era (ERA_BEFORE_BE).
year-of-era - The year-of-era for the current era increases uniformly from the epoch at year one.
  For the previous era the year increases from one as time goes backwards.
  The value for the current era is equal to the ISO proleptic-year plus 543.
proleptic-year - The proleptic year is the same as the year-of-era for the
  current era. For the previous era, years have zero, then negative values.
  The value is equal to the ISO proleptic-year plus 543.
month-of-year - The ThaiBuddhist month-of-year exactly matches ISO.
day-of-month - The ThaiBuddhist day-of-month exactly matches ISO.
day-of-year - The ThaiBuddhist day-of-year exactly matches ISO.
leap-year - The ThaiBuddhist leap-year pattern exactly matches ISO, such that the two calendars
  are never out of step.
Implementation Requirements:
This class is immutable and thread-safe.

TemporalAccessor
temporal)
Description copied from interface:
Chronology
Obtains a local date in this chronology from another temporal object.
This obtains a date in this chronology based on the specified temporal.
 A
TemporalAccessor
represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
 which this factory converts to an instance of
ChronoLocalDate
.
The conversion typically uses the
EPOCH_DAY
field, which is standardized across calendar systems.
This method matches the signature of the functional interface
TemporalQuery
allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,
aChronology::date
.
Specified by:
date
in interface

This obtains a date-time in this chronology based on the specified temporal.
 A
TemporalAccessor
represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
 which this factory converts to an instance of
ChronoLocalDateTime
.
The conversion extracts and combines the
ChronoLocalDate
and the
LocalTime
from the temporal object.
 Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
 those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.
 The result uses this chronology.
This method matches the signature of the functional interface

Description copied from interface:
Chronology
Obtains a
ChronoZonedDateTime
in this chronology from another temporal object.
This obtains a zoned date-time in this chronology based on the specified temporal.
 A
TemporalAccessor
represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
 which this factory converts to an instance of
ChronoZonedDateTime
.
The conversion will first obtain a
ZoneId
from the temporal object,
 falling back to a
ZoneOffset
if necessary. It will then try to obtain
 an
Instant
, falling back to a
ChronoLocalDateTime
if necessary.
 The result will be either the combination of
ZoneId
or
ZoneOffset
with
Instant
or
ChronoLocalDateTime
.
 Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
 those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.
 The result uses this chronology.

boolean
isLeapYear
(long prolepticYear)
Checks if the specified year is a leap year.
Thai Buddhist leap years occur exactly in line with ISO leap years.
 This method does not validate the year passed in, and only has a
 well-defined result for years in the supported range.
Specified by:
isLeapYear
in interface

 int yearOfEra)
Description copied from interface:
Chronology
Calculates the proleptic-year given the era and year-of-era.
This combines the era and year-of-era into the single proleptic-year field.
If the chronology makes active use of eras, such as
JapaneseChronology
then the year-of-era will be validated against the era.
 For other chronologies, validation is optional.
Specified by:
prolepticYear
in interface
Chronology
Parameters:
era
- the era of the correct type for the chronology, not null
yearOfEra
- the chronology year-of-era
Returns:
the proleptic-year
eraOf
public
ThaiBuddhistEra
eraOf
(int eraValue)
Description copied from interface:
Chronology
Creates the chronology era object from the numeric value.
The era is, conceptually, the largest division of the time-line.
 Most calendar systems have a single epoch dividing the time-line into two eras.
 However, some have multiple eras, such as one for the reign of each leader.
 The exact meaning is determined by the chronology according to the following constraints.
The era in use at 1970-01-01 must have the value 1.
 Later eras must have sequentially higher values.
 Earlier eras must have sequentially lower values.
 Each chronology must refer to an enum or similar singleton to provide the era values.
This method returns the singleton era of the correct type for the specified era value.
Specified by:
eraOf
in interface
Chronology
Parameters:
eraValue
- the era value
Returns:
the calendar system era, not null
eras
public
List

()
Description copied from interface:
Chronology
Gets the list of eras for the chronology.
Most calendar systems have an era, within which the year has meaning.
 If the calendar system does not support the concept of eras, an empty
 list must be returned.
Specified by:

Returns:
the list of eras for the chronology, may be immutable, not null
range

ChronoField
field)
Description copied from interface:
Chronology
Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.
All fields can be expressed as a
long
integer.
 This method returns an object that describes the valid range for that value.
Note that the result only describes the minimum and maximum valid values
 and it is important not to read too much into them. For example, there
 could be values within the range that are invalid for the field.
This method will return a result whether or not the chronology supports the field.
Specified by:
range
in interface

Parameters:
field
- the field to get the range for, not null
Returns:
the range of valid values for the field, not null

resolverStyle)
Description copied from class:
AbstractChronology
Resolves parsed
ChronoField
values into a date during parsing.
Most
TemporalField
implementations are resolved using the
 resolve method on the field. By contrast, the
ChronoField
class
 defines fields that only have meaning relative to the chronology.
 As such,
ChronoField
date fields are resolved here in the
 context of a specific chronology.
ChronoField
instances are resolved by this method, which may
 be overridden in subclasses.
EPOCH_DAY
- If present, this is converted to a date and
  all other date fields are then cross-checked against the date.
PROLEPTIC_MONTH
- If present, then it is split into the
YEAR
and
MONTH_OF_YEAR
. If the mode is strict or smart
  then the field is validated.
YEAR_OF_ERA
and
ERA
- If both are present, then they
  are combined to form a
YEAR
. In lenient mode, the
YEAR_OF_ERA
range is not validated, in smart and strict mode it is. The
ERA
is
  validated for range in all three modes. If only the
YEAR_OF_ERA
is
  present, and the mode is smart or lenient, then the last available era
  is assumed. In strict mode, no era is assumed and the
YEAR_OF_ERA
is
  left untouched. If only the
ERA
is present, then it is left untouched.
YEAR
,
MONTH_OF_YEAR
and
DAY_OF_MONTH
-
  If all three are present, then they are combined to form a date.
  In all three modes, the
YEAR
is validated.
  If the mode is smart or strict, then the month and day are validated.
  If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
  creating a date on the first day of the first month in the requested year,
  then adding the difference in months, then the difference in days.
  If the mode is smart, and the day-of-month is greater than the maximum for
  the year-month, then the day-of-month is adjusted to the last day-of-month.
  If the mode is strict, then the three fields must form a valid date.
YEAR
and
DAY_OF_YEAR
-
  If both are present, then they are combined to form a date.
  In all three modes, the
YEAR
is validated.
  If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
  creating a date on the first day of the requested year, then adding
  the difference in days.
  If the mode is smart or strict, then the two fields must form a valid date.
YEAR
,
MONTH_OF_YEAR
,
ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH
and
ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH
-
  If all four are present, then they are combined to form a date.
  In all three modes, the
YEAR
is validated.
  If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
  creating a date on the first day of the first month in the requested year, then adding
  the difference in months, then the difference in weeks, then in days.
  If the mode is smart or strict, then the all four fields are validated to
  their outer ranges. The date is then combined in a manner equivalent to
  creating a date on the first day of the requested year and month, then adding
  the amount in weeks and days to reach their values. If the mode is strict,
  the date is additionally validated to check that the day and week adjustment
  did not change the month.
YEAR
,
MONTH_OF_YEAR
,
ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH
and
DAY_OF_WEEK
- If all four are present, then they are combined to
  form a date. The approach is the same as described above for
  years, months and weeks in
ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH
.
  The day-of-week is adjusted as the next or same matching day-of-week once
  the years, months and weeks have been handled.
YEAR
,
ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR
and
ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR
-
  If all three are present, then they are combined to form a date.
  In all three modes, the
YEAR
is validated.
  If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
  creating a date on the first day of the requested year, then adding
  the difference in weeks, then in days.
  If the mode is smart or strict, then the all three fields are validated to
  their outer ranges. The date is then combined in a manner equivalent to
  creating a date on the first day of the requested year, then adding
  the amount in weeks and days to reach their values. If the mode is strict,
  the date is additionally validated to check that the day and week adjustment
  did not change the year.
YEAR
,
ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR
and
DAY_OF_WEEK
-
  If all three are present, then they are combined to form a date.
  The approach is the same as described above for years and weeks in
ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR
. The day-of-week is adjusted as the
  next or same matching day-of-week once the years and weeks have been handled.
The default implementation is suitable for most calendar systems.
 If
ChronoField.YEAR_OF_ERA
is found without an
ChronoField.ERA
then the last era in
Chronology.eras()
is used.
 The implementation assumes a 7 day week, that the first day-of-month
 has the value 1, that first day-of-year has the value 1, and that the
 first of the month and year always exists.
