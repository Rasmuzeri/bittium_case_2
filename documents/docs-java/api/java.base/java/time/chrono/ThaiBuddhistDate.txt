public final class
ThaiBuddhistDate
extends
Object
implements
ChronoLocalDate
,
Serializable
A date in the Thai Buddhist calendar system.
This date operates using the
Thai Buddhist calendar
.
 This calendar system is primarily used in Thailand.
 Dates are aligned such that
2484-01-01 (Buddhist)
is
1941-01-01 (ISO)
.
This is a
value-based
class; programmers should treat instances that are
equal
as interchangeable and should not
 use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may
 occur. For example, in a future release, synchronization may fail.
 The
equals
method should be used for comparisons.
Implementation Requirements:
This class is immutable and thread-safe.
Since:
1.8

now
()
Obtains the current
ThaiBuddhistDate
from the system clock in the default time-zone.
This will query the
system clock
in the default
 time-zone to obtain the current date.
Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
 because the clock is hard-coded.
Returns:
the current date using the system clock and default time-zone, not null
now

ZoneId
zone)
Obtains the current
ThaiBuddhistDate
from the system clock in the specified time-zone.
This will query the
system clock
to obtain the current date.
 Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.
Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
 because the clock is hard-coded.
Parameters:
zone
- the zone ID to use, not null
Returns:
the current date using the system clock, not null

ThaiBuddhistDate
representing a date in the Thai Buddhist calendar
 system from the proleptic-year, month-of-year and day-of-month fields.
This returns a
ThaiBuddhistDate
with the specified fields.
 The day must be valid for the year and month, otherwise an exception will be thrown.
Parameters:
prolepticYear
- the Thai Buddhist proleptic-year
month
- the Thai Buddhist month-of-year, from 1 to 12
dayOfMonth
- the Thai Buddhist day-of-month, from 1 to 31
Returns:
the date in Thai Buddhist calendar system, not null

(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
Obtains a
ThaiBuddhistDate
from a temporal object.
This obtains a date in the Thai Buddhist calendar system based on the specified temporal.
 A
TemporalAccessor
represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
 which this factory converts to an instance of
ThaiBuddhistDate
.
The conversion typically uses the
EPOCH_DAY
field, which is standardized across calendar systems.
This method matches the signature of the functional interface
TemporalQuery
allowing it to be used as a query via method reference,
ThaiBuddhistDate::from
.
Parameters:
temporal
- the temporal object to convert, not null
Returns:
the date in Thai Buddhist calendar system, not null
Throws:
DateTimeException
- if unable to convert to a
ThaiBuddhistDate
getChronology
public
ThaiBuddhistChronology
getChronology
()
Gets the chronology of this date, which is the Thai Buddhist calendar system.
The
Chronology
represents the calendar system in use.
 The era and other fields in
ChronoField
are defined by the chronology.
Specified by:
getChronology
in interface
ChronoLocalDate
Returns:
the Thai Buddhist chronology, not null
getEra
public
ThaiBuddhistEra
getEra
()
Gets the era applicable at this date.
The Thai Buddhist calendar system has two eras, 'BE' and 'BEFORE_BE',
 defined by
ThaiBuddhistEra
.
Specified by:
getEra
in interface
ChronoLocalDate
Returns:
the era applicable at this date, not null
lengthOfMonth
public
int
lengthOfMonth
()
Returns the length of the month represented by this date.
This returns the length of the month in days.
 Month lengths match those of the ISO calendar system.
Specified by:
lengthOfMonth
in interface
ChronoLocalDate
Returns:
the length of the month in days
getLong
public
long
getLong
(
TemporalField
field)
Description copied from interface:
TemporalAccessor
Gets the value of the specified field as a
long
.
This queries the date-time for the value of the specified field.
 The returned value may be outside the valid range of values for the field.
 If the date-time cannot return the value, because the field is unsupported or for
 some other reason, an exception will be thrown.
Specified by:
getLong
in interface
TemporalAccessor
Parameters:
field
- the field to get, not null
Returns:
the value for the field
with
public
ThaiBuddhistDate
with
(
TemporalField
field,
 long newValue)
Description copied from interface:
ChronoLocalDate
Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered.
This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed.
 For example, on a
LocalDate
, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.
 The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.
In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
 a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
 In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
 the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.
Specified by:
with
in interface
ChronoLocalDate
Specified by:
with
in interface
Temporal
Parameters:
field
- the field to set in the result, not null
newValue
- the new value of the field in the result
Returns:
an object of the same type with the specified field set, not null
with
public
ThaiBuddhistDate
with
(
TemporalAdjuster
adjuster)
Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.
This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
 A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
 A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
 A selection of common adjustments is provided in
TemporalAdjusters
.
 These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
 The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
 lengths of month and leap years.
Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:
date = date.with(Month.JULY);        // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
  date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth());  // static import from Adjusters
  date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY));   // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
Specified by:
with
in interface
ChronoLocalDate
Specified by:
with
in interface
Temporal
Parameters:
adjuster
- the adjuster to use, not null
Returns:
an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
Throws:
DateTimeException
- if unable to make the adjustment
ArithmeticException
- if numeric overflow occurs
plus
public
ThaiBuddhistDate
plus
(
TemporalAmount
amount)
Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount added.
This adjusts this temporal, adding according to the rules of the specified amount.
 The amount is typically a
Period
but may be any other type implementing
 the
TemporalAmount
interface, such as
Duration
.
Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:
date = date.plus(period);                // add a Period instance
  date = date.plus(duration);              // add a Duration instance
  date = date.plus(workingDays(6));        // example user-written workingDays method
Note that calling
plus
followed by
minus
is not guaranteed to
 return the same date-time.
Specified by:
plus
in interface
ChronoLocalDate
Specified by:
plus
in interface
Temporal
Parameters:
amount
- the amount to add, not null
Returns:
an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
Throws:
DateTimeException
- if the addition cannot be made
ArithmeticException
- if numeric overflow occurs
minus
public
ThaiBuddhistDate
minus
(
TemporalAmount
amount)
Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount subtracted.
This adjusts this temporal, subtracting according to the rules of the specified amount.
 The amount is typically a
Period
but may be any other type implementing
 the
TemporalAmount
interface, such as
Duration
.
Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:
date = date.minus(period);               // subtract a Period instance
  date = date.minus(duration);             // subtract a Duration instance
  date = date.minus(workingDays(6));       // example user-written workingDays method
Note that calling
plus
followed by
minus
is not guaranteed to
 return the same date-time.

(
LocalTime
localTime)
Description copied from interface:
ChronoLocalDate
Combines this date with a time to create a
ChronoLocalDateTime
.
This returns a
ChronoLocalDateTime
formed from this date at the specified time.
 All possible combinations of date and time are valid.
Specified by:

ChronoLocalDate
Parameters:
localTime
- the local time to use, not null
Returns:
the local date-time formed from this date and the specified time, not null
until
public
ChronoPeriod
until
(
ChronoLocalDate
endDate)
Description copied from interface:
ChronoLocalDate
Calculates the period between this date and another date as a
ChronoPeriod
.
This calculates the period between two dates. All supplied chronologies
 calculate the period using years, months and days, however the
ChronoPeriod
API allows the period to be represented using other units.
The start and end points are
this
and the specified date.
 The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
 The negative sign will be the same in each of year, month and day.
The calculation is performed using the chronology of this date.
 If necessary, the input date will be converted to match.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Specified by:
until
in interface
ChronoLocalDate
Parameters:
endDate
- the end date, exclusive, which may be in any chronology, not null
Returns:
the period between this date and the end date, not null
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Compares this date to another date, including the chronology.
Compares this
ThaiBuddhistDate
with another ensuring that the date is the same.
Only objects of type
ThaiBuddhistDate
are compared, other types return false.
 To compare the dates of two
TemporalAccessor
instances, including dates
 in two different chronologies, use
ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY
as a comparator.
Specified by:
equals
in interface
ChronoLocalDate
Parameters:
obj
- the object to check, null returns false
Returns:
true if this is equal to the other date
See Also:
Object.hashCode()
HashMap
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
A hash code for this date.
Specified by:
hashCode
in interface
ChronoLocalDate
Returns:
a suitable hash code based only on the Chronology and the date

public
long
until
(
Temporal
endExclusive,
TemporalUnit
unit)
Description copied from interface:
ChronoLocalDate
Calculates the amount of time until another date in terms of the specified unit.
This calculates the amount of time between two
ChronoLocalDate
objects in terms of a single
TemporalUnit
.
 The start and end points are
this
and the specified date.
 The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
 The
Temporal
passed to this method is converted to a
ChronoLocalDate
using
Chronology.date(TemporalAccessor)
.
 The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
 complete units between the two dates.
 For example, the amount in days between two dates can be calculated
 using
startDate.until(endDate, DAYS)
.
There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 The first is to invoke this method.
 The second is to use
TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)
:
// these two lines are equivalent
   amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
   amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
The calculation is implemented in this method for
ChronoUnit
.
 The units
DAYS
,
WEEKS
,
MONTHS
,
YEARS
,
DECADES
,
CENTURIES
,
MILLENNIA
and
ERAS
should be supported by all implementations.
 Other
ChronoUnit
values will throw an exception.
If the unit is not a
ChronoUnit
, then the result of this method
 is obtained by invoking
TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)
passing
this
as the first argument and the converted input temporal as
 the second argument.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Specified by:
until
in interface
ChronoLocalDate
Specified by:
until
in interface

Parameters:
endExclusive
- the end date, exclusive, which is converted to a
ChronoLocalDate
in the same chronology, not null
unit
- the unit to measure the amount in, not null
Returns:
the amount of time between this date and the end date
