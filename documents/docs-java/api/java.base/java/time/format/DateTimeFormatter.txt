Class DateTimeFormatter
java.lang.Object
java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter
public final class
DateTimeFormatter
extends
Object
Formatter for printing and parsing date-time objects.
This class provides the main application entry point for printing and parsing
 and provides common implementations of
DateTimeFormatter
:
Using predefined constants, such as
ISO_LOCAL_DATE
Using pattern letters, such as
uuuu-MMM-dd
Using localized styles, such as
long
or
medium
More complex formatters are provided by
DateTimeFormatterBuilder
.
The main date-time classes provide two methods - one for formatting,
format(DateTimeFormatter formatter)
, and one for parsing,
parse(CharSequence text, DateTimeFormatter formatter)
.
For example:
LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
  String text = date.format(formatter);
  LocalDate parsedDate = LocalDate.parse(text, formatter);
In addition to the format, formatters can be created with desired Locale,
 Chronology, ZoneId, and DecimalStyle.
The
withLocale
method returns a new formatter that
 overrides the locale. The locale affects some aspects of formatting and
 parsing. For example, the
ofLocalizedDate
provides a
 formatter that uses the locale specific date format.
The
withChronology
method returns a new formatter
 that overrides the chronology. If overridden, the date-time value is
 converted to the chronology before formatting. During parsing the date-time
 value is converted to the chronology before it is returned.
The
withZone
method returns a new formatter that overrides
 the zone. If overridden, the date-time value is converted to a ZonedDateTime
 with the requested ZoneId before formatting. During parsing the ZoneId is
 applied before the value is returned.
The
withDecimalStyle
method returns a new formatter that
 overrides the
DecimalStyle
. The DecimalStyle symbols are used for
 formatting and parsing.
Some applications may need to use the older
java.text.Format
class for formatting. The
toFormat()
method returns an
 implementation of
java.text.Format
.

Patterns for Formatting and Parsing
Patterns are based on a simple sequence of letters and symbols.
 A pattern is used to create a Formatter using the
ofPattern(String)
and
ofPattern(String, Locale)
methods.
 For example,
"d MMM uuuu"
will format 2011-12-03 as '3 Dec 2011'.
 A formatter created from a pattern can be used as many times as necessary,
 it is immutable and is thread-safe.
For example:
LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
  DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy MM dd");
  String text = date.format(formatter);
  LocalDate parsedDate = LocalDate.parse(text, formatter);
All letters 'A' to 'Z' and 'a' to 'z' are reserved as pattern letters. The
 following pattern letters are defined:

The count of pattern letters determines the format.
Text
: The text style is determined based on the number of pattern
 letters used. Less than 4 pattern letters will use the
short form
. Exactly 4 pattern letters will use the
full form
. Exactly 5 pattern letters will use the
narrow form
.
 Pattern letters 'L', 'c', and 'q' specify the stand-alone form of the text styles.
Number
: If the count of letters is one, then the value is output using
 the minimum number of digits and without padding. Otherwise, the count of digits
 is used as the width of the output field, with the value zero-padded as necessary.
 The following pattern letters have constraints on the count of letters.
 Only one letter of 'c' and 'F' can be specified.
 Up to two letters of 'd', 'H', 'h', 'K', 'k', 'm', and 's' can be specified.
 Up to three letters of 'D' can be specified.
Number/Text
: If the count of pattern letters is 3 or greater, use the
 Text rules above. Otherwise use the Number rules above.
Fraction
: Outputs the nano-of-second field as a fraction-of-second.
 The nano-of-second value has nine digits, thus the count of pattern letters
 is from 1 to 9. If it is less than 9, then the nano-of-second value is
 truncated, with only the most significant digits being output.
Year
: The count of letters determines the minimum field width below
 which padding is used. If the count of letters is two, then a
reduced
two digit form is
 used. For printing, this outputs the rightmost two digits. For parsing, this
 will parse using the base value of 2000, resulting in a year within the range
 2000 to 2099 inclusive. If the count of letters is less than four (but not
 two), then the sign is only output for negative years as per
SignStyle.NORMAL
. Otherwise, the sign is output if the pad width is
 exceeded, as per
SignStyle.EXCEEDS_PAD
.
ZoneId
: This outputs the time-zone ID, such as 'Europe/Paris'. If the
 count of letters is two, then the time-zone ID is output. Any other count of
 letters throws
IllegalArgumentException
.
Zone names
: This outputs the display name of the time-zone ID. If the
 pattern letter is 'z' the output is the daylight saving aware zone name.
 If there is insufficient information to determine whether DST applies,
 the name ignoring daylight saving time will be used.
 If the count of letters is one, two or three, then the short name is output.
 If the count of letters is four, then the full name is output.
 Five or more letters throws
IllegalArgumentException
.
If the pattern letter is 'v' the output provides the zone name ignoring
 daylight saving time. If the count of letters is one, then the short name is output.
 If the count of letters is four, then the full name is output.
 Two, three and five or more letters throw
IllegalArgumentException
.
Offset X and x
: This formats the offset based on the number of pattern
 letters. One letter outputs just the hour, such as '+01', unless the minute
 is non-zero in which case the minute is also output, such as '+0130'. Two
 letters outputs the hour and minute, without a colon, such as '+0130'. Three
 letters outputs the hour and minute, with a colon, such as '+01:30'. Four
 letters outputs the hour and minute and optional second, without a colon,
 such as '+013015'. Five letters outputs the hour and minute and optional
 second, with a colon, such as '+01:30:15'. Six or more letters throws
IllegalArgumentException
. Pattern letter 'X' (upper case) will output
 'Z' when the offset to be output would be zero, whereas pattern letter 'x'
 (lower case) will output '+00', '+0000', or '+00:00'.
Offset O
: With a non-zero offset, this formats the localized offset
 based on the number of pattern letters. One letter outputs the
short
form of the localized offset, which is
 localized offset text, such as 'GMT', with hour without leading zero, optional
 2-digit minute and second if non-zero, and colon, for example 'GMT+8'. Four
 letters outputs the
full
form, which is localized
 offset text, such as 'GMT, with 2-digit hour and minute field, optional second
 field if non-zero, and colon, for example 'GMT+08:00'. If the offset is zero,
 only localized text is output. Any other count of letters throws
IllegalArgumentException
.
Offset Z
: This formats the offset based on the number of pattern
 letters. One, two or three letters outputs the hour and minute, without a
 colon, such as '+0130'. The output will be '+0000' when the offset is zero.
 Four letters outputs the
full
form of localized
 offset, equivalent to four letters of Offset-O. The output will be the
 corresponding localized offset text if the offset is zero. Five
 letters outputs the hour, minute, with optional second if non-zero, with
 colon. It outputs 'Z' if the offset is zero.
 Six or more letters throws
IllegalArgumentException
.
Optional section
: The optional section markers work exactly like
 calling
DateTimeFormatterBuilder.optionalStart()
and
DateTimeFormatterBuilder.optionalEnd()
.
Pad modifier
: Modifies the pattern that immediately follows to be
 padded with spaces. The pad width is determined by the number of pattern
 letters. This is the same as calling
DateTimeFormatterBuilder.padNext(int)
.
For example, 'ppH' outputs the hour-of-day padded on the left with spaces to
 a width of 2.
Any unrecognized letter is an error. Any non-letter character, other than
 '[', ']', '{', '}', '#' and the single quote will be output directly.
 Despite this, it is recommended to use single quotes around all characters
 that you want to output directly to ensure that future changes do not break
 your application.
Resolving
Parsing is implemented as a two-phase operation.
 First, the text is parsed using the layout defined by the formatter, producing
 a
Map
of field to value, a
ZoneId
and a
Chronology
.
 Second, the parsed data is
resolved
, by validating, combining and
 simplifying the various fields into more useful ones.
Five parsing methods are supplied by this class.
 Four of these perform both the parse and resolve phases.
 The fifth method,
parseUnresolved(CharSequence, ParsePosition)
,
 only performs the first phase, leaving the result unresolved.
 As such, it is essentially a low-level operation.
The resolve phase is controlled by two parameters, set on this class.
The
ResolverStyle
is an enum that offers three different approaches,
 strict, smart and lenient. The smart option is the default.
 It can be set using
withResolverStyle(ResolverStyle)
.
The
withResolverFields(TemporalField...)
parameter allows the
 set of fields that will be resolved to be filtered before resolving starts.
 For example, if the formatter has parsed a year, month, day-of-month
 and day-of-year, then there are two approaches to resolve a date:
 (year + month + day-of-month) and (year + day-of-year).
 The resolver fields allows one of the two approaches to be selected.
 If no resolver fields are set then both approaches must result in the same date.
Resolving separate fields to form a complete date and time is a complex
 process with behaviour distributed across a number of classes.
 It follows these steps:
The chronology is determined.
 The chronology of the result is either the chronology that was parsed,
 or if no chronology was parsed, it is the chronology set on this class,
 or if that is null, it is
IsoChronology
.
The
ChronoField
date fields are resolved.
 This is achieved using
Chronology.resolveDate(Map, ResolverStyle)
.
 Documentation about field resolution is located in the implementation
 of
Chronology
.
The
ChronoField
time fields are resolved.
 This is documented on
ChronoField
and is the same for all chronologies.
Any fields that are not
ChronoField
are processed.
 This is achieved using
TemporalField.resolve(Map, TemporalAccessor, ResolverStyle)
.
 Documentation about field resolution is located in the implementation
 of
TemporalField
.
The
ChronoField
date and time fields are re-resolved.
 This allows fields in step four to produce
ChronoField
values
 and have them be processed into dates and times.
A
LocalTime
is formed if there is at least an hour-of-day available.
 This involves providing default values for minute, second and fraction of second.
Any remaining unresolved fields are cross-checked against any
 date and/or time that was resolved. Thus, an earlier stage would resolve
 (year + month + day-of-month) to a date, and this stage would check that
 day-of-week was valid for the date.
If an
excess number of days
was parsed then it is added to the date if a date is available.
If a second-based field is present, but
LocalTime
was not parsed,
 then the resolver ensures that milli, micro and nano second values are
 available to meet the contract of
ChronoField
.
 These will be set to zero if missing.
If both date and time were parsed and either an offset or zone is present,
 the field
ChronoField.INSTANT_SECONDS
is created.
 If an offset was parsed then the offset will be combined with the
LocalDateTime
to form the instant, with any zone ignored.
 If a
ZoneId
was parsed without an offset then the zone will be
 combined with the
LocalDateTime
to form the instant using the rules
 of
ChronoLocalDateTime.atZone(ZoneId)
. If the
ZoneId
was
 parsed from a zone name that indicates whether daylight saving time is in
 operation or not, then that fact will be used to select the correct offset
 at the local time-line overlap.

This class is immutable and thread-safe.

Field Details
ISO_LOCAL_DATE
public static final
DateTimeFormatter
ISO_LOCAL_DATE
The ISO date formatter that formats or parses a date without an
 offset, such as '2011-12-03'.
This returns an immutable formatter capable of formatting and parsing
 the ISO-8601 extended local date format.
 The format consists of:
Four digits or more for the

 such as '2011-12-03T10:15:30Z'.
This returns an immutable formatter capable of formatting and parsing
 the ISO-8601 instant format.
 When formatting, the instant will always be suffixed by 'Z' to indicate UTC.
 The second-of-minute is always output.
 The nano-of-second outputs zero, three, six or nine digits as necessary.
 When parsing, the behaviour of
DateTimeFormatterBuilder.appendOffsetId()
will be used to parse the offset, converting the instant to UTC as necessary.
 The time to at least the seconds field is required.
 Fractional seconds from zero to nine are parsed.
 The localized decimal style is not used.
This is a special case formatter intended to allow a human readable form
 of an
Instant
. The
Instant
class is designed to
 only represent a point in time and internally stores a value in nanoseconds
 from a fixed epoch of 1970-01-01Z. As such, an
Instant
cannot be
 formatted as a date or time without providing some form of time-zone.
 This formatter allows the
Instant
to be formatted, by providing
 a suitable conversion using
ZoneOffset.UTC
.
The format consists of:
The
ISO_OFFSET_DATE_TIME
where the instant is converted from
ChronoField.INSTANT_SECONDS
and
ChronoField.NANO_OF_SECOND
using the
UTC
offset. Parsing is case insensitive.

String
requestedTemplate)
Creates a locale specific formatter derived from the requested template for
 the ISO chronology. The requested template is a series of typical pattern
 symbols in canonical order from the largest date or time unit to the smallest,
 which can be expressed with the following regular expression:
Copy
"G{0,5}" +        // Era
     "y*" +            // Year
     "Q{0,5}" +        // Quarter
     "M{0,5}" +        // Month
     "w*" +            // Week of Week Based Year
     "E{0,5}" +        // Day of Week
     "d{0,2}" +        // Day of Month
     "B{0,5}" +        // Period/AmPm of Day
     "[hHjC]{0,2}" +   // Hour of Day/AmPm (refer to LDML for 'j' and 'C')
     "m{0,2}" +        // Minute of Hour
     "s{0,2}" +        // Second of Minute
     "[vz]{0,4}"       // Zone
All pattern symbols are optional, and each pattern symbol represents a field,
 for example, 'M' represents the Month field. The number of the pattern symbol letters follows the
 same presentation, such as "number" or "text" as in the
Patterns for
 Formatting and Parsing
section. Other pattern symbols in the requested template are
 invalid.
The mapping of the requested template to the closest of the available localized formats
 is defined by the
Unicode LDML specification
. For example, the formatter created from the requested template
yMMM
will format the date '2020-06-16' to 'Jun 2020' in the
US locale
.
The locale is determined from the formatter. The formatter returned directly by
 this method uses the
default FORMAT locale

parsedExcessDays
public static final
TemporalQuery
<
Period
>
parsedExcessDays
()
A query that provides access to the excess days that were parsed.
This returns a singleton
query
that provides
 access to additional information from the parse. The query always returns
 a non-null period, with a zero period returned instead of null.
There are two situations where this query may return a non-zero period.
If the
ResolverStyle
is
LENIENT
and a time is parsed
  without a date, then the complete result of the parse consists of a
LocalTime
and an excess
Period
in days.
If the
ResolverStyle
is
SMART
and a time is parsed
  without a date where the time is 24:00:00, then the complete result of
  the parse consists of a
LocalTime
of 00:00:00 and an excess
Period
of one day.
In both cases, if a complete
ChronoLocalDateTime
or
Instant
is parsed, then the excess days are added to the date part.
 As a result, this query will return a zero period.
The
SMART
behaviour handles the common "end of day" 24:00 value.
 Processing in
LENIENT
mode also produces the same result:
Text to parse        Parsed object                         Excess days
  "2012-12-03T00:00"   LocalDateTime.of(2012, 12, 3, 0, 0)   ZERO
  "2012-12-03T24:00"   LocalDateTime.of(2012, 12, 4, 0, 0)   ZERO
  "00:00"              LocalTime.of(0, 0)                    ZERO
  "24:00"              LocalTime.of(0, 0)                    Period.ofDays(1)
The query can be used as follows:
TemporalAccessor parsed = formatter.parse(str);
  LocalTime time = parsed.query(LocalTime::from);
  Period extraDays = parsed.query(DateTimeFormatter.parsedExcessDays());
Returns:
a query that provides access to the excess days that were parsed

 access to additional information from the parse. The query always returns
 a non-null boolean, true if parsing saw a leap-second, false if not.
Instant parsing handles the special "leap second" time of '23:59:60'.
 Leap seconds occur at '23:59:60' in the UTC time-zone, but at other
 local times in different time-zones. To avoid this potential ambiguity,
 the handling of leap-seconds is limited to
DateTimeFormatterBuilder.appendInstant()
, as that method
 always parses the instant with the UTC zone offset.
If the time '23:59:60' is received, then a simple conversion is applied,
 replacing the second-of-minute of 60 with 59. This query can be used
 on the parse result to determine if the leap-second adjustment was made.
 The query will return
true
if it did adjust to remove the
 leap-second, and
false
if not. Note that applying a leap-second
 smoothing mechanism, such as UTC-SLS, is the responsibility of the
 application, as follows:
TemporalAccessor parsed = formatter.parse(str);
  Instant instant = parsed.query(Instant::from);
  if (parsed.query(DateTimeFormatter.parsedLeapSecond())) {
    // validate leap-second is correct and apply correct smoothing
  }
Returns:
a query that provides access to whether a leap-second was parsed
getLocale
public
Locale
getLocale
()
Gets the locale to be used during formatting.
This is used to lookup any part of the formatter needing specific
 localization, such as the text or localized pattern.
Returns:
the locale of this formatter, not null
withLocale
public
DateTimeFormatter
withLocale
(
Locale
locale)
Returns a copy of this formatter with a new locale.
This is used to lookup any part of the formatter needing specific
 localization, such as the text or localized pattern.
The locale is stored as passed in, without further processing.
 If the locale has
Unicode extensions
, they may be used later in text
 processing. To set the chronology, time-zone and decimal style from
 unicode extensions, see
localizedBy()
.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Parameters:
locale
- the new locale, not null
Returns:
a formatter based on this formatter with the requested locale, not null
See Also:
localizedBy(Locale)
localizedBy
public
DateTimeFormatter
localizedBy
(
Locale
locale)
Returns a copy of this formatter with localized values of the locale,
 calendar, region, decimal style and/or timezone, that supersede values in
 this formatter.
This is used to lookup any part of the formatter needing specific
 localization, such as the text or localized pattern. If the locale contains the
 "ca" (calendar), "nu" (numbering system), "rg" (region override), and/or
 "tz" (timezone)
Unicode extensions
,
 the chronology, numbering system and/or the zone are overridden. If both "ca"
 and "rg" are specified, the chronology from the "ca" extension supersedes the
 implicit one from the "rg" extension. Same is true for the "nu" extension.
Unlike the
withLocale
method, the call to this method may
 produce a different formatter depending on the order of method chaining with
 other withXXXX() methods.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Parameters:
locale
- the locale, not null
Returns:
a formatter based on this formatter with localized values of
      the calendar, decimal style and/or timezone, that supersede values in this
      formatter.
Since:
10

getDecimalStyle
public
DecimalStyle
getDecimalStyle
()
Gets the DecimalStyle to be used during formatting.
Returns:
the DecimalStyle of this formatter, not null
withDecimalStyle
public
DateTimeFormatter
withDecimalStyle
(
DecimalStyle
decimalStyle)
Returns a copy of this formatter with a new DecimalStyle.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Parameters:
decimalStyle
- the new DecimalStyle, not null
Returns:
a formatter based on this formatter with the requested DecimalStyle, not null
getChronology
public
Chronology
getChronology
()
Gets the overriding chronology to be used during formatting.
This returns the override chronology, used to convert dates.
 By default, a formatter has no override chronology, returning null.
 See
withChronology(Chronology)
for more details on overriding.
Returns:
the override chronology of this formatter, null if no override
withChronology
public
DateTimeFormatter
withChronology
(
Chronology
chrono)
Returns a copy of this formatter with a new override chronology.
This returns a formatter with similar state to this formatter but
 with the override chronology set.
 By default, a formatter has no override chronology, returning null.
If an override is added, then any date that is formatted or parsed will be affected.
When formatting, if the temporal object contains a date, then it will
 be converted to a date in the override chronology.
 Whether the temporal contains a date is determined by querying the
EPOCH_DAY
field.
 Any time or zone will be retained unaltered unless overridden.
If the temporal object does not contain a date, but does contain one
 or more
ChronoField
date fields, then a
DateTimeException
is thrown. In all other cases, the override chronology is added to the temporal,
 replacing any previous chronology, but without changing the date/time.
When parsing, there are two distinct cases to consider.
 If a chronology has been parsed directly from the text, perhaps because
DateTimeFormatterBuilder.appendChronologyId()
was used, then
 this override chronology has no effect.
 If no zone has been parsed, then this override chronology will be used
 to interpret the
ChronoField
values into a date according to the
 date resolving rules of the chronology.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Parameters:
chrono
- the new chronology, null if no override
Returns:
a formatter based on this formatter with the requested override chronology, not null
getZone
public
ZoneId
getZone
()
Gets the overriding zone to be used during formatting.
This returns the override zone, used to convert instants.
 By default, a formatter has no override zone, returning null.
 See
withZone(ZoneId)
for more details on overriding.
Returns:
the override zone of this formatter, null if no override
withZone
public
DateTimeFormatter
withZone
(
ZoneId
zone)
Returns a copy of this formatter with a new override zone.
This returns a formatter with similar state to this formatter but
 with the override zone set.
 By default, a formatter has no override zone, returning null.
If an override is added, then any instant that is formatted or parsed will be affected.
When formatting, if the temporal object contains an instant, then it will
 be converted to a zoned date-time using the override zone.
 Whether the temporal is an instant is determined by querying the
INSTANT_SECONDS
field.
 If the input has a chronology then it will be retained unless overridden.
 If the input does not have a chronology, such as
Instant
, then
 the ISO chronology will be used.
If the temporal object does not contain an instant, but does contain
 an offset then an additional check is made. If the normalized override
 zone is an offset that differs from the offset of the temporal, then
 a
DateTimeException
is thrown. In all other cases, the override
 zone is added to the temporal, replacing any previous zone, but without
 changing the date/time.
When parsing, there are two distinct cases to consider.
 If a zone has been parsed directly from the text, perhaps because
DateTimeFormatterBuilder.appendZoneId()
was used, then
 this override zone has no effect.
 If no zone has been parsed, then this override zone will be included in
 the result of the parse where it can be used to build instants and date-times.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Parameters:
zone
- the new override zone, null if no override
Returns:
a formatter based on this formatter with the requested override zone, not null
getResolverStyle
public
ResolverStyle
getResolverStyle
()
Gets the resolver style to use during parsing.
This returns the resolver style, used during the second phase of parsing
 when fields are resolved into dates and times.
 By default, a formatter has the
SMART
resolver style.
 See
withResolverStyle(ResolverStyle)
for more details.
Returns:
the resolver style of this formatter, not null
withResolverStyle
public
DateTimeFormatter
withResolverStyle
(
ResolverStyle
resolverStyle)
Returns a copy of this formatter with a new resolver style.
This returns a formatter with similar state to this formatter but
 with the resolver style set. By default, a formatter has the
SMART
resolver style.
Changing the resolver style only has an effect during parsing.
 Parsing a text string occurs in two phases.
 Phase 1 is a basic text parse according to the fields added to the builder.
 Phase 2 resolves the parsed field-value pairs into date and/or time objects.
 The resolver style is used to control how phase 2, resolving, happens.
 See
ResolverStyle
for more information on the options available.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Parameters:
resolverStyle
- the new resolver style, not null
Returns:
a formatter based on this formatter with the requested resolver style, not null
getResolverFields
public
Set
<
TemporalField
>
getResolverFields
()
Gets the resolver fields to use during parsing.
This returns the resolver fields, used during the second phase of parsing
 when fields are resolved into dates and times.
 By default, a formatter has no resolver fields, and thus returns null.
 See
withResolverFields(Set)
for more details.
Returns:
the immutable set of resolver fields of this formatter, null if no fields
withResolverFields
public
DateTimeFormatter
withResolverFields
(
TemporalField
... resolverFields)
Returns a copy of this formatter with a new set of resolver fields.
This returns a formatter with similar state to this formatter but with
 the resolver fields set. By default, a formatter has no resolver fields.
Changing the resolver fields only has an effect during parsing.
 Parsing a text string occurs in two phases.
 Phase 1 is a basic text parse according to the fields added to the builder.
 Phase 2 resolves the parsed field-value pairs into date and/or time objects.
 The resolver fields are used to filter the field-value pairs between phase 1 and 2.
This can be used to select between two or more ways that a date or time might
 be resolved. For example, if the formatter consists of year, month, day-of-month
 and day-of-year, then there are two ways to resolve a date.
 Calling this method with the arguments
YEAR
and
DAY_OF_YEAR
will ensure that the date is
 resolved using the year and day-of-year, effectively meaning that the month
 and day-of-month are ignored during the resolving phase.
In a similar manner, this method can be used to ignore secondary fields that
 would otherwise be cross-checked. For example, if the formatter consists of year,
 month, day-of-month and day-of-week, then there is only one way to resolve a
 date, but the parsed value for day-of-week will be cross-checked against the
 resolved date. Calling this method with the arguments
YEAR
,
MONTH_OF_YEAR
and
DAY_OF_MONTH
will ensure that the date is
 resolved correctly, but without any cross-check for the day-of-week.
In implementation terms, this method behaves as follows. The result of the
 parsing phase can be considered to be a map of field to value. The behavior
 of this method is to cause that map to be filtered between phase 1 and 2,
 removing all fields other than those specified as arguments to this method.
This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
Parameters:
resolverFields

- the new set of resolver fields, null if no fields
Returns:
a formatter based on this formatter with the requested resolver style, not null
format
public
String
format
(
TemporalAccessor
temporal)
Formats a date-time object using this formatter.
This formats the date-time to a String using the rules of the formatter.
Parameters:
temporal
- the temporal object to format, not null
Returns:
the formatted string, not null
Throws:
DateTimeException
- if an error occurs during formatting
formatTo
public
void
formatTo
(
TemporalAccessor
temporal,
Appendable
appendable)
Formats a date-time object to an
Appendable
using this formatter.
This outputs the formatted date-time to the specified destination.
Appendable
is a general purpose interface that is implemented by all
 key character output classes including
StringBuffer
,
StringBuilder
,
PrintStream
and
Writer
.
Although
Appendable
methods throw an
IOException
, this method does not.
 Instead, any
IOException
is wrapped in a runtime exception.
Parameters:
temporal
- the temporal object to format, not null
appendable
- the appendable to format to, not null
Throws:
DateTimeException
- if an error occurs during formatting
parse
public
TemporalAccessor
parse
(
CharSequence
text)
Fully parses the text producing a temporal object.
This parses the entire text producing a temporal object.
 It is typically more useful to use
parse(CharSequence, TemporalQuery)
.
 The result of this method is
TemporalAccessor
which has been resolved,
 applying basic validation checks to help ensure a valid date-time.
If the parse completes without reading the entire length of the text,
 or a problem occurs during parsing or merging, then an exception is thrown.
Parameters:
text
- the text to parse, not null
Returns:
the parsed temporal object, not null
Throws:
DateTimeParseException
- if unable to parse the requested result
parse
public
TemporalAccessor
parse
(
CharSequence
text,
ParsePosition
position)
Parses the text using this formatter, providing control over the text position.
This parses the text without requiring the parse to start from the beginning
 of the string or finish at the end.
 The result of this method is
TemporalAccessor
which has been resolved,
 applying basic validation checks to help ensure a valid date-time.
The text will be parsed from the specified start
ParsePosition
.
 The entire length of the text does not have to be parsed, the
ParsePosition
will be updated with the index at the end of parsing.
The operation of this method is slightly different to similar methods using
ParsePosition
on
java.text.Format
. That class will return
 errors using the error index on the
ParsePosition
. By contrast, this
 method will throw a
DateTimeParseException
if an error occurs, with
 the exception containing the error index.
 This change in behavior is necessary due to the increased complexity of
 parsing and resolving dates/times in this API.
If the formatter parses the same field more than once with different values,
 the result will be an error.
Parameters:
text
- the text to parse, not null
position
- the position to parse from, updated with length parsed
  and the index of any error, not null
Returns:
the parsed temporal object, not null
Throws:
DateTimeParseException
- if unable to parse the requested result
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- if the position is invalid
parse
public
<T>
T
parse
(
CharSequence
text,
TemporalQuery
<T> query)
Fully parses the text producing an object of the specified type.
Most applications should use this method for parsing.
 It parses the entire text to produce the required date-time.
 The query is typically a method reference to a
from(TemporalAccessor)
method.
 For example:
LocalDateTime dt = parser.parse(str, LocalDateTime::from);
If the parse completes without reading the entire length of the text,
 or a problem occurs during parsing or merging, then an exception is thrown.
Type Parameters:
T
- the type of the parsed date-time
Parameters:
text
- the text to parse, not null
query
- the query defining the type to parse to, not null
Returns:
the parsed date-time, not null
Throws:
DateTimeParseException
- if unable to parse the requested result
parseBest
public
TemporalAccessor
parseBest
(
CharSequence
text,
TemporalQuery
<?>... queries)
Fully parses the text producing an object of one of the specified types.
This parse method is convenient for use when the parser can handle optional elements.
 For example, a pattern of 'uuuu-MM-dd HH.mm[ VV]' can be fully parsed to a
ZonedDateTime
,
 or partially parsed to a
LocalDateTime
.
 The queries must be specified in order, starting from the best matching full-parse option
 and ending with the worst matching minimal parse option.
 The query is typically a method reference to a
from(TemporalAccessor)
method.
The result is associated with the first type that successfully parses.
 Normally, applications will use
instanceof
to check the result.
 For example:
TemporalAccessor dt = parser.parseBest(str, ZonedDateTime::from, LocalDateTime::from);
  if (dt instanceof ZonedDateTime) {
   ...
  } else {
   ...
  }
If the parse completes without reading the entire length of the text,
 or a problem occurs during parsing or merging, then an exception is thrown.
Parameters:
text
- the text to parse, not null
queries
- the queries defining the types to attempt to parse to,
  must implement
TemporalAccessor
, not null
Returns:
the parsed date-time, not null
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if less than 2 types are specified
DateTimeParseException
- if unable to parse the requested result
parseUnresolved
public
TemporalAccessor
parseUnresolved
(
CharSequence
text,
ParsePosition
position)
Parses the text using this formatter, without resolving the result, intended
 for advanced use cases.
Parsing is implemented as a two-phase operation.
 First, the text is parsed using the layout defined by the formatter, producing
 a
Map
of field to value, a
ZoneId
and a
Chronology
.
 Second, the parsed data is
resolved
, by validating, combining and
 simplifying the various fields into more useful ones.
 This method performs the parsing stage but not the resolving stage.
The result of this method is
TemporalAccessor
which represents the
 data as seen in the input. Values are not validated, thus parsing a date string
 of '2012-00-65' would result in a temporal with three fields - year of '2012',
 month of '0' and day-of-month of '65'.
The text will be parsed from the specified start
ParsePosition
.
 The entire length of the text does not have to be parsed, the
ParsePosition
will be updated with the index at the end of parsing.
Errors are returned using the error index field of the
ParsePosition
instead of
DateTimeParseException
.
 The returned error index will be set to an index indicative of the error.
 Callers must check for errors before using the result.
If the formatter parses the same field more than once with different values,
 the result will be an error.
This method is intended for advanced use cases that need access to the
 internal state during parsing. Typical application code should use
parse(CharSequence, TemporalQuery)
or the parse method on the target type.
Parameters:
text
- the text to parse, not null
position
- the position to parse from, updated with length parsed
  and the index of any error, not null
Returns:
the parsed text, null if the parse results in an error
Throws:
DateTimeException
- if some problem occurs during parsing
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- if the position is invalid
