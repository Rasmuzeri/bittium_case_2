Enumeration of different ways to resolve dates and times.
Parsing a text string occurs in two phases.
 Phase 1 is a basic text parse according to the fields added to the builder.
 Phase 2 resolves the parsed field-value pairs into date and/or time objects.
 This style is used to control how phase 2, resolving, happens.
Implementation Requirements:
This is an immutable and thread-safe enum.

Enum Constant Details
STRICT
public static final
ResolverStyle
STRICT
Style to resolve dates and times strictly.
Using strict resolution will ensure that all parsed values are within
 the outer range of valid values for the field. Individual fields may
 be further processed for strictness.
For example, resolving year-month and day-of-month in the ISO calendar
 system using strict mode will ensure that the day-of-month is valid
 for the year-month, rejecting invalid values.
SMART
public static final
ResolverStyle
SMART
Style to resolve dates and times in a smart, or intelligent, manner.
Using smart resolution will perform the sensible default for each
 field, which may be the same as strict, the same as lenient, or a third
 behavior. Individual fields will interpret this differently.
For example, resolving year-month and day-of-month in the ISO calendar
 system using smart mode will ensure that the day-of-month is from
 1 to 31, converting any value beyond the last valid day-of-month to be
 the last valid day-of-month.
LENIENT
public static final
ResolverStyle
LENIENT
Style to resolve dates and times leniently.
Using lenient resolution will resolve the values in an appropriate
 lenient manner. Individual fields will interpret this differently.
For example, lenient mode allows the month in the ISO calendar system
 to be outside the range 1 to 12.
 For example, month 15 is treated as being 3 months after month 12.

Returns the enum constant of this class with the specified name.
The string must match
exactly
an identifier used to declare an
enum constant in this class.  (Extraneous whitespace characters are 
not permitted.)
Parameters:
name
- the name of the enum constant to be returned.
Returns:
the enum constant with the specified name
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if this enum class has no constant with the specified name
NullPointerException
- if the argument is null
