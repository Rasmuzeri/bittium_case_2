Enum Constant Details
NORMAL
public static final
SignStyle
NORMAL
Style to output the sign only if the value is negative.
In strict parsing, the negative sign will be accepted and the positive sign rejected.
 In lenient parsing, any sign will be accepted.
ALWAYS
public static final
SignStyle
ALWAYS
Style to always output the sign, where zero will output '+'.
In strict parsing, the absence of a sign will be rejected.
 In lenient parsing, any sign will be accepted, with the absence
 of a sign treated as a positive number.
NEVER
public static final
SignStyle
NEVER
Style to never output sign, only outputting the absolute value.
In strict parsing, any sign will be rejected.
 In lenient parsing, any sign will be accepted unless the width is fixed.
NOT_NEGATIVE
public static final
SignStyle
NOT_NEGATIVE
Style to block negative values, throwing an exception on printing.
In strict parsing, any sign will be rejected.
 In lenient parsing, any sign will be accepted unless the width is fixed.
EXCEEDS_PAD
public static final
SignStyle
EXCEEDS_PAD
Style to always output the sign if the value exceeds the pad width.
 A negative value will always output the '-' sign.
In strict parsing, the sign will be rejected unless the pad width is exceeded.
 In lenient parsing, any sign will be accepted, with the absence
 of a sign treated as a positive number.
