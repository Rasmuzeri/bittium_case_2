java.io
Provides for system input and output through data streams,
 serialization and the file system.

 Unless otherwise noted, passing a
null
argument to a constructor or
 method in any class or interface in this package will cause a
NullPointerException
to be thrown.

 A
pathname string
passed as a
String
argument to a
 constructor or method in any class or interface in this package will be
 interpreted as described in the class specification of
File

Object Serialization
Warning: Deserialization of untrusted data is inherently dangerous
 and should be avoided. Untrusted data should be carefully validated according to the
 "Serialization and Deserialization" section of the
Secure Coding Guidelines for Java SE

An InputStreamReader is a bridge from byte streams to character streams: It
 reads bytes and decodes them into characters using a specified
charset
.

Thrown when the Serialization runtime detects one of the following
 problems with a Class.
InvalidObjectException
Indicates that one or more deserialized objects failed validation
 tests.
IOError
Thrown when a serious I/O error has occurred.
IOException
Signals that an I/O exception of some sort has occurred.
LineNumberInputStream
Deprecated.
This class incorrectly assumes that bytes adequately represent
             characters.
LineNumberReader
A buffered character-input stream that keeps track of line numbers.

ObjectInput extends the DataInput interface to include the reading of
 objects.
ObjectInputFilter

ObjectInputFilter.Config
A utility class to set and get the JVM-wide deserialization filter factory,
 the static JVM-wide filter, or to create a filter from a pattern string.
