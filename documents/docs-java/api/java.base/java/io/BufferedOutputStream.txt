public class
BufferedOutputStream
extends
FilterOutputStream
The class implements a buffered output stream. By setting up such
 an output stream, an application can write bytes to the underlying
 output stream without necessarily causing a call to the underlying
 system for each byte written.
Since:
1.0

buf
The internal buffer where data is stored.

int
count
The number of valid bytes in the buffer. This value is always
 in the range
0
through
buf.length
; elements
buf[0]
through
buf[count-1]
contain valid
 byte data.
Constructor Details
BufferedOutputStream
public
BufferedOutputStream
(
OutputStream
out)
Creates a new buffered output stream to write data to the
 specified underlying output stream.
Parameters:
out
- the underlying output stream.
BufferedOutputStream
public
BufferedOutputStream
(
OutputStream
out,
 int size)
Creates a new buffered output stream to write data to the
 specified underlying output stream with the specified buffer
 size.
Parameters:
out
- the underlying output stream.
size
- the buffer size.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if size <= 0.
Method Details
write
public
void
write
(int b)
throws
IOException
Writes the specified byte to this buffered output stream.
Overrides:
write
in class
FilterOutputStream
Parameters:
b
- the byte to be written.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
write
public
void
write
(byte[] b,
 int off,
 int len)
throws
IOException
Writes
len
bytes from the specified byte array
 starting at offset
off
to this buffered output stream.
Ordinarily this method stores bytes from the given array into this
 stream's buffer, flushing the buffer to the underlying output stream as
 needed.  If the requested length is at least as large as this stream's
 buffer, however, then this method will flush the buffer and write the
 bytes directly to the underlying output stream.  Thus redundant
BufferedOutputStream
s will not copy data unnecessarily.
Overrides:
write
in class
FilterOutputStream
Parameters:
b
- the data.
off
- the start offset in the data.
len
- the number of bytes to write.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- If
off
is negative,
len
is negative, or
len
is greater than
b.length - off

FilterOutputStream.write(int)
flush
public
void
flush
()
           throws
IOException
Flushes this buffered output stream. This forces any buffered
 output bytes to be written out to the underlying output stream.
Specified by:
flush
in interface
Flushable
Overrides:
flush
in class
FilterOutputStream
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
