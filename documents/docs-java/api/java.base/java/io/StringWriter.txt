StringWriter
extends
Writer
A character stream that collects its output in a string buffer, which can
 then be used to construct a string.
Closing a
StringWriter
has no effect. The methods in this class
 can be called after the stream has been closed without generating an
IOException
.

 size.
StringWriter
public
StringWriter
(int initialSize)
Create a new string writer using the specified initial string-buffer
 size.
Parameters:
initialSize
- The number of
char
values that will fit into this buffer
        before it is automatically expanded
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException

initialSize
is negative
Method Details
write
public
void
write
(int c)
Write a single character.
Overrides:
write
in class
Writer
Parameters:
c
- int specifying a character to be written
write
public
void
write
(char[] cbuf,
 int off,
 int len)

Specified by:
write
in class
Writer
Parameters:
cbuf
- Array of characters
off
- Offset from which to start writing characters
len
- Number of characters to write
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- If
off
is negative, or
len
is negative,
          or
off + len
is negative or greater than the length
          of the given array
write
public
void
write
(
String
str)
Write a string.
Overrides:

void
write
(
String
str,
 int off,
 int len)

Overrides:
write
in class
Writer
Parameters:
str
- String to be written
off
- Offset from which to start writing characters
len
- Number of characters to write
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- If
off
is negative, or
len
is negative,
          or
off + len
is negative or greater than the length
          of the given string
append
public
StringWriter
append
(
CharSequence
csq)
Appends the specified character sequence to this writer.
An invocation of this method of the form
out.append(csq)
behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation
Copy
out.write(csq.toString())
Depending on the specification of
toString
for the
 character sequence
csq
, the entire sequence may not be
 appended. For instance, invoking the
toString
method of a
 character buffer will return a subsequence whose content depends upon
 the buffer's position and limit.
Specified by:
append
in interface
Appendable
Overrides:
append
in class
Writer
Parameters:
csq
- The character sequence to append.  If
csq
is
null
, then the four characters
"null"
are
         appended to this writer.
Returns:
This writer
Since:
1.5
append
public
StringWriter
append
(
CharSequence
csq,
 int start,
 int end)
Appends a subsequence of the specified character sequence to this writer.
An invocation of this method of the form
out.append(csq, start, end)
when
csq
is not
null
, behaves in
 exactly the same way as the invocation
Copy
out.write(csq.subSequence(start, end).toString())
Specified by:
append
in interface
Appendable
Overrides:
append
in class
Writer
Parameters:
csq
- The character sequence from which a subsequence will be
         appended.  If
csq
is
null
, then characters
         will be appended as if
csq
contained the four
         characters
"null"
.
start
- The index of the first character in the subsequence
end
- The index of the character following the last character in the
         subsequence
Returns:
This writer
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- If
start
or
end
are negative,
start
is greater than
end
, or
end
is greater than
csq.length()
Since:
1.5
append
public
StringWriter
append
(char c)
Appends the specified character to this writer.
An invocation of this method of the form
out.append(c)
behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation
Copy
out.write(c)
Specified by:
append
in interface
Appendable
Overrides:
append
in class
Writer
Parameters:
c
- The 16-bit character to append
Returns:
This writer
Since:
1.5
toString
public
String
toString
()
Return the buffer's current value as a string.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
a string representation of the object.
getBuffer
public
StringBuffer
getBuffer
()
Return the string buffer itself.
Returns:
StringBuffer holding the current buffer value.
flush
public
void
flush
()
Flush the stream.
The
flush
method of
StringWriter
does nothing.

Specified by:
flush
in class

close
public
void
close
()
           throws
IOException
Closing a
StringWriter
has no effect. The methods in this
 class can be called after the stream has been closed without generating
 an
IOException
.
