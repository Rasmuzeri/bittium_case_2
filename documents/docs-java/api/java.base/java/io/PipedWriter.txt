Constructor Details
PipedWriter
public
PipedWriter
(
PipedReader
snk)
throws
IOException
Creates a piped writer connected to the specified piped
 reader. Data characters written to this stream will then be
 available as input from
snk
.
Parameters:
snk
- The piped reader to connect to.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
PipedWriter
public
PipedWriter
()
Creates a piped writer that is not yet connected to a
 piped reader. It must be connected to a piped reader,
 either by the receiver or the sender, before being used.
See Also:
PipedReader.connect(java.io.PipedWriter)
connect(java.io.PipedReader)
Method Details
connect
public
void
connect
(
PipedReader
snk)
throws
IOException
Connects this piped writer to a receiver. If this object
 is already connected to some other piped reader, an
IOException
is thrown.
If
snk
is an unconnected piped reader and
src
is an unconnected piped writer, they may
 be connected by either the call:
Copy
src.connect(snk)
or the call:
Copy
snk.connect(src)
The two calls have the same effect.
Parameters:
snk
- the piped reader to connect to.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
write
public
void
write
(int c)
throws
IOException
Writes the specified
char
to the piped output stream.
 If a thread was reading data characters from the connected piped input
 stream, but the thread is no longer alive, then an
IOException
is thrown.
Implements the
write
method of
Writer
.
Overrides:
write
in class
Writer
Parameters:
c
- the
char
to be written.
Throws:
IOException
- if the pipe is
broken
,
unconnected
, closed
          or an I/O error occurs.
write
public
void
write
(char[] cbuf,
 int off,
 int len)
throws
IOException
Writes
len
characters from the specified character array
 starting at offset
off
to this piped output stream.
 This method blocks until all the characters are written to the output
 stream.
 If a thread was reading data characters from the connected piped input
 stream, but the thread is no longer alive, then an
IOException
is thrown.
Specified by:
write
in class
Writer
Parameters:
cbuf
- the data.
off
- the start offset in the data.
len
- the number of characters to write.
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- If
off
is negative, or
len
is negative,
          or
off + len
is negative or greater than the length
          of the given array
IOException
- if the pipe is
broken
,
unconnected
, closed
          or an I/O error occurs.
flush
public
void
flush
()
           throws
IOException
Flushes this output stream and forces any buffered output characters
 to be written out.
 This will notify any readers that characters are waiting in the pipe.
Specified by:
flush
in interface
Flushable
Specified by:
flush
in class
Writer
Throws:
IOException
- if the pipe is closed, or an I/O error occurs.
close
public
void
close
()
           throws
IOException
Closes this piped output stream and releases any system resources
 associated with this stream. This stream may no longer be used for
 writing characters.
Specified by:
close
in interface
AutoCloseable
Specified by:
close
in interface
Closeable
Specified by:
