Method Details
writeObject
void
writeObject
(
Object
obj)
throws
IOException
Write an object to the underlying storage or stream.  The
 class that implements this interface defines how the object is
 written.
Parameters:
obj
- the object to be written
Throws:
IOException
- Any of the usual Input/Output related exceptions.
write
void
write
(int b)
throws
IOException
Writes a byte. This method will block until the byte is actually
 written.
Specified by:
write
in interface
DataOutput
Parameters:
b
- the byte
Throws:
IOException
- If an I/O error has occurred.
write
void
write
(byte[] b)
throws
IOException
Writes an array of bytes. This method will block until the bytes
 are actually written.
Specified by:
write
in interface
DataOutput
Parameters:
b
- the data to be written
Throws:
IOException
- If an I/O error has occurred.
write
void
write
(byte[] b,
 int off,
 int len)
throws
IOException
Writes a sub array of bytes.
Specified by:
write
in interface
DataOutput
Parameters:
b
- the data to be written
off
- the start offset in the data
len
- the number of bytes that are written
Throws:
IOException
- If an I/O error has occurred.
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- If
off
is negative,
len
is negative, or
len
is greater than
b.length - off
flush
void
flush
()
    throws
IOException
Flushes the stream. This will write any buffered
 output bytes.
Throws:
IOException
- If an I/O error has occurred.
close
void
close
()
    throws
IOException
Closes the stream. This method must be called
 to release any resources associated with the
 stream.
Specified by:
close
in interface
AutoCloseable
Throws:
