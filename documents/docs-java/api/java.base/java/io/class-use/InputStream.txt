Modifier and Type
Class
Description
class

 the ability to buffer the input and to
 support the
mark
and
reset
methods.
class

ByteArrayInputStream
contains
 an internal buffer that contains bytes that
 may be read from the stream.

 to a piped output stream; the piped  input
 stream then provides whatever data bytes
 are written to the piped output  stream.
