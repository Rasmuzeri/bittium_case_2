Modifier and Type
Class
Description
class
BufferedOutputStream
The class implements a buffered output stream.
class
BufferedWriter
Writes text to a character-output stream, buffering characters so as to
 provide for the efficient writing of single characters, arrays, and strings.
class
ByteArrayOutputStream
This class implements an output stream in which the data is
 written into a byte array.
class
CharArrayWriter
This class implements a character buffer that can be used as a Writer.
class
Console
Methods to access the character-based console device, if any, associated
 with the current Java virtual machine.
class
DataOutputStream
A data output stream lets an application write primitive Java data
 types to an output stream in a portable way.
class
FileOutputStream
A file output stream is an output stream for writing data to a
File
or to a
FileDescriptor
.
class
FileWriter
Writes text to character files using a default buffer size.
class
FilterOutputStream
This class is the superclass of all classes that filter output
 streams.
class
FilterWriter
Abstract class for writing filtered character streams.
class
ObjectOutputStream
An ObjectOutputStream writes primitive data types and graphs of Java objects
 to an OutputStream.
class
OutputStream
This abstract class is the superclass of all classes representing
 an output stream of bytes.
class
OutputStreamWriter
An OutputStreamWriter is a bridge from character streams to byte streams:
 Characters written to it are encoded into bytes using a specified
charset
.
class
PipedOutputStream
A piped output stream can be connected to a piped input stream
 to create a communications pipe.
class
PipedWriter
Piped character-output streams.
class
PrintStream
A
PrintStream
adds functionality to another output stream,
 namely the ability to print representations of various data values
 conveniently.
class
PrintWriter
Prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream.
class
StringWriter
A character stream that collects its output in a string buffer, which can
 then be used to construct a string.
class
Writer
Abstract class for writing to character streams.
