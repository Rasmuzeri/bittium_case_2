An ObjectInputStream deserializes primitive data and objects previously
 written using an ObjectOutputStream.
Warning: Deserialization of untrusted data is inherently dangerous
 and should be avoided. Untrusted data should be carefully validated according to the
 "Serialization and Deserialization" section of the
Secure Coding Guidelines for Java SE
.
Serialization Filtering
describes best
 practices for defensive use of serial filters.
The key to disabling deserialization attacks is to prevent instances of
 arbitrary classes from being deserialized, thereby preventing the direct or
 indirect execution of their methods.
ObjectInputFilter
describes how to use filters and
ObjectInputFilter.Config
describes how to configure the filter and filter factory.
 Each stream has an optional deserialization filter
 to check the classes and resource limits during deserialization.
 The JVM-wide filter factory ensures that a filter can be set on every
ObjectInputStream
and every object read from the stream can be checked.
 The
ObjectInputStream constructors
invoke the filter factory
 to select the initial filter which may be updated or replaced by
setObjectInputFilter(java.io.ObjectInputFilter)
.
If an ObjectInputStream has a filter, the
ObjectInputFilter
can check that
 the classes, array lengths, number of references in the stream, depth, and
 number of bytes consumed from the input stream are allowed and
 if not, can terminate deserialization.
ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream can provide an application with
 persistent storage for graphs of objects when used with a FileOutputStream
 and FileInputStream respectively.  ObjectInputStream is used to recover
 those objects previously serialized. Other uses include passing objects
 between hosts using a socket stream or for marshaling and unmarshaling
 arguments and parameters in a remote communication system.
ObjectInputStream ensures that the types of all objects in the graph
 created from the stream match the classes present in the Java Virtual
 Machine.  Classes are loaded as required using the standard mechanisms.
Only objects that support the java.io.Serializable or
 java.io.Externalizable interface can be read from streams.
The method
readObject
is used to read an object from the
 stream.  Java's safe casting should be used to get the desired type.  In
 Java, strings and arrays are objects and are treated as objects during
 serialization. When read they need to be cast to the expected type.
Primitive data types can be read from the stream using the appropriate
 method on DataInput.
The default deserialization mechanism for objects restores the contents
 of each field to the value and type it had when it was written.  Fields
 declared as transient or static are ignored by the deserialization process.
 References to other objects cause those objects to be read from the stream
 as necessary.  Graphs of objects are restored correctly using a reference
 sharing mechanism.  New objects are always allocated when deserializing,
 which prevents existing objects from being overwritten.
Reading an object is analogous to running the constructors of a new
 object.  Memory is allocated for the object and initialized to zero (NULL).
 No-arg constructors are invoked for the non-serializable classes and then
 the fields of the serializable classes are restored from the stream starting
 with the serializable class closest to java.lang.object and finishing with
 the object's most specific class.
For example to read from a stream as written by the example in
ObjectOutputStream
:
Copy
try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("t.tmp");
         ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis)) {
        String label = (String) ois.readObject();
        LocalDateTime dateTime = (LocalDateTime) ois.readObject();
        // Use label and dateTime
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        // handle exception
    }
Classes control how they are serialized by implementing either the
 java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable interfaces.
Implementing the Serializable interface allows object serialization to
 save and restore the entire state of the object and it allows classes to
 evolve between the time the stream is written and the time it is read.  It
 automatically traverses references between objects, saving and restoring
 entire graphs.
Serializable classes that require special handling during the
 serialization and deserialization process should implement methods
 with the following signatures:
Copy
private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream stream)
        throws IOException;
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream stream)
        throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
    private void readObjectNoData()
        throws ObjectStreamException;
The method name, modifiers, return type, and number and type of
 parameters must match exactly for the method to be used by
 serialization or deserialization. The methods should only be
 declared to throw checked exceptions consistent with these
 signatures.
The readObject method is responsible for reading and restoring the state
 of the object for its particular class using data written to the stream by
 the corresponding writeObject method.  The method does not need to concern
 itself with the state belonging to its superclasses or subclasses.  State is
 restored by reading data from the ObjectInputStream for the individual
 fields and making assignments to the appropriate fields of the object.
 Reading primitive data types is supported by DataInput.
Any attempt to read object data which exceeds the boundaries of the
 custom data written by the corresponding writeObject method will cause an
 OptionalDataException to be thrown with an eof field value of true.
 Non-object reads which exceed the end of the allotted data will reflect the
 end of data in the same way that they would indicate the end of the stream:
 bytewise reads will return -1 as the byte read or number of bytes read, and
 primitive reads will throw EOFExceptions.  If there is no corresponding
 writeObject method, then the end of default serialized data marks the end of
 the allotted data.
Primitive and object read calls issued from within a readExternal method
 behave in the same manner--if the stream is already positioned at the end of
 data written by the corresponding writeExternal method, object reads will
 throw OptionalDataExceptions with eof set to true, bytewise reads will
 return -1, and primitive reads will throw EOFExceptions.  Note that this
 behavior does not hold for streams written with the old
ObjectStreamConstants.PROTOCOL_VERSION_1
protocol, in which the
 end of data written by writeExternal methods is not demarcated, and hence
 cannot be detected.
The readObjectNoData method is responsible for initializing the state of
 the object for its particular class in the event that the serialization
 stream does not list the given class as a superclass of the object being
 deserialized.  This may occur in cases where the receiving party uses a
 different version of the deserialized instance's class than the sending
 party, and the receiver's version extends classes that are not extended by
 the sender's version.  This may also occur if the serialization stream has
 been tampered; hence, readObjectNoData is useful for initializing
 deserialized objects properly despite a "hostile" or incomplete source
 stream.
Serialization does not read or assign values to the fields of any object
 that does not implement the java.io.Serializable interface.  Subclasses of
 Objects that are not serializable can be serializable. In this case the
 non-serializable class must have a no-arg constructor to allow its fields to
 be initialized.  In this case it is the responsibility of the subclass to
 save and restore the state of the non-serializable class. It is frequently
 the case that the fields of that class are accessible (public, package, or
 protected) or that there are get and set methods that can be used to restore
 the state.
Any exception that occurs while deserializing an object will be caught by
 the ObjectInputStream and abort the reading process.
Implementing the Externalizable interface allows the object to assume
 complete control over the contents and format of the object's serialized
 form.  The methods of the Externalizable interface, writeExternal and
 readExternal, are called to save and restore the objects state.  When
 implemented by a class they can write and read their own state using all of
 the methods of ObjectOutput and ObjectInput.  It is the responsibility of
 the objects to handle any versioning that occurs.
Enum constants are deserialized differently than ordinary serializable or
 externalizable objects.  The serialized form of an enum constant consists
 solely of its name; field values of the constant are not transmitted.  To
 deserialize an enum constant, ObjectInputStream reads the constant name from
 the stream; the deserialized constant is then obtained by calling the static
 method
Enum.valueOf(Class, String)
with the enum constant's
 base type and the received constant name as arguments.  Like other
 serializable or externalizable objects, enum constants can function as the
 targets of back references appearing subsequently in the serialization
 stream.  The process by which enum constants are deserialized cannot be
 customized: any class-specific readObject, readObjectNoData, and readResolve
 methods defined by enum types are ignored during deserialization.
 Similarly, any serialPersistentFields or serialVersionUID field declarations
 are also ignored--all enum types have a fixed serialVersionUID of 0L.
Records are serialized differently than ordinary serializable or externalizable
 objects. During deserialization the record's canonical constructor is invoked
 to construct the record object. Certain serialization-related methods, such
 as readObject and writeObject, are ignored for serializable records. See
Java Object Serialization Specification,
Section 1.13,
 "Serialization of Records"
for additional information.

Constructor Details
ObjectInputStream
public
ObjectInputStream
(
InputStream
in)
throws
IOException
Creates an ObjectInputStream that reads from the specified InputStream.
 A serialization stream header is read from the stream and verified.
 This constructor will block until the corresponding ObjectOutputStream
 has written and flushed the header.
The constructor initializes the deserialization filter to the filter returned
 by invoking the serial filter factory returned from
ObjectInputFilter.Config.getSerialFilterFactory()
with
null
for the current filter
 and the
static JVM-wide filter
for the requested filter.
 If the serial filter or serial filter factory properties are invalid
 an
IllegalStateException
is thrown.
 When the filter factory
apply
method is invoked it may throw a runtime exception
 preventing the
ObjectInputStream
from being constructed.
If a security manager is installed, this constructor will check for
 the "enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission when invoked
 directly or indirectly by the constructor of a subclass which overrides
 the ObjectInputStream.readFields or ObjectInputStream.readUnshared
 methods.
Parameters:
in
- input stream to read from
Throws:
StreamCorruptedException
- if the stream header is incorrect
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs while reading stream header
SecurityException
- if untrusted subclass illegally overrides
          security-sensitive methods
IllegalStateException
- if the initialization of
ObjectInputFilter.Config
fails due to invalid serial filter or serial filter factory properties.

readObject
()
                        throws
IOException
,
ClassNotFoundException
Read an object from the ObjectInputStream.  The class of the object, the
 signature of the class, and the values of the non-transient and
 non-static fields of the class and all of its supertypes are read.
 Default deserializing for a class can be overridden using the writeObject
 and readObject methods.  Objects referenced by this object are read
 transitively so that a complete equivalent graph of objects is
 reconstructed by readObject.
The root object is completely restored when all of its fields and the
 objects it references are completely restored.  At this point the object
 validation callbacks are executed in order based on their registered
 priorities. The callbacks are registered by objects (in the readObject
 special methods) as they are individually restored.
The deserialization filter, when not
null
, is invoked for
 each object (regular or class) read to reconstruct the root object.
 See
setObjectInputFilter
for details.
Exceptions are thrown for problems with the InputStream and for
 classes that should not be deserialized.  All exceptions are fatal to
 the InputStream and leave it in an indeterminate state; it is up to the
 caller to ignore or recover the stream state.

readUnshared
()
                    throws
IOException
,
ClassNotFoundException
Reads an "unshared" object from the ObjectInputStream.  This method is
 identical to readObject, except that it prevents subsequent calls to
 readObject and readUnshared from returning additional references to the
 deserialized instance obtained via this call.  Specifically:
If readUnshared is called to deserialize a back-reference (the
       stream representation of an object which has been written
       previously to the stream), an ObjectStreamException will be
       thrown.
If readUnshared returns successfully, then any subsequent attempts
       to deserialize back-references to the stream handle deserialized
       by readUnshared will cause an ObjectStreamException to be thrown.
Deserializing an object via readUnshared invalidates the stream handle
 associated with the returned object.  Note that this in itself does not
 always guarantee that the reference returned by readUnshared is unique;
 the deserialized object may define a readResolve method which returns an
 object visible to other parties, or readUnshared may return a Class
 object or enum constant obtainable elsewhere in the stream or through
 external means. If the deserialized object defines a readResolve method
 and the invocation of that method returns an array, then readUnshared
 returns a shallow clone of that array; this guarantees that the returned
 array object is unique and cannot be obtained a second time from an
 invocation of readObject or readUnshared on the ObjectInputStream,
 even if the underlying data stream has been manipulated.
The deserialization filter, when not
null
, is invoked for
 each object (regular or class) read to reconstruct the root object.
 See
setObjectInputFilter
for details.
ObjectInputStream subclasses which override this method can only be
 constructed in security contexts possessing the
 "enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission; any attempt to
 instantiate such a subclass without this permission will cause a
 SecurityException to be thrown.
Returns:

throws

InvalidObjectException
Register an object to be validated before the graph is returned.  While
 similar to resolveObject these validations are called after the entire
 graph has been reconstituted.  Typically, a readObject method will
 register the object with the stream so that when all of the objects are
 restored a final set of validations can be performed.
Parameters:
obj
- the object to receive the validation callback.
prio
- controls the order of callbacks; zero is a good default.
          Use higher numbers to be called back earlier, lower numbers for
          later callbacks. Within a priority, callbacks are processed in
          no particular order.
Throws:
NotActiveException
- The stream is not currently reading objects
          so it is invalid to register a callback.
InvalidObjectException
- The validation object is null.

Load the local class equivalent of the specified stream class
 description.  Subclasses may implement this method to allow classes to
 be fetched from an alternate source.
The corresponding method in
ObjectOutputStream
is
annotateClass
.  This method will be invoked only once for
 each unique class in the stream.  This method can be implemented by
 subclasses to use an alternate loading mechanism but must return a
Class
object. Once returned, if the class is not an array
 class, its serialVersionUID is compared to the serialVersionUID of the
 serialized class, and if there is a mismatch, the deserialization fails
 and an
InvalidClassException
is thrown.
The default implementation of this method in
ObjectInputStream
returns the result of calling
Copy
Class.forName(desc.getName(), false, loader)
where
loader
is the first class loader on the current
 thread's stack (starting from the currently executing method) that is
 neither the
platform
 class loader
nor its ancestor; otherwise,
loader
is the
platform class loader
. If this call results in a

instance is the Java language keyword
 for a primitive type or void, then the
Class
object
 representing that primitive type or void will be returned

resolveProxyClass
(
String
[] interfaces)
throws
IOException
,
ClassNotFoundException
Returns a proxy class that implements the interfaces named in a proxy
 class descriptor; subclasses may implement this method to read custom
 data from the stream along with the descriptors for dynamic proxy
 classes, allowing them to use an alternate loading mechanism for the
 interfaces and the proxy class.
This method is called exactly once for each unique proxy class
 descriptor in the stream.
The corresponding method in
ObjectOutputStream
is
annotateProxyClass
.  For a given subclass of
ObjectInputStream
that overrides this method, the
annotateProxyClass
method in the corresponding subclass of
ObjectOutputStream
must write any data or objects read by
 this method.
The default implementation of this method in
ObjectInputStream
returns the result of calling
Proxy.getProxyClass
with the list of
Class
objects for the interfaces that are named in the
interfaces
parameter.  The
Class
object for each interface name
i
is the value returned by calling
Copy
Class.forName(i, false, loader)
where
loader
is the first class loader on the current
 thread's stack (starting from the currently executing method) that is
 neither the
platform
 class loader
nor its ancestor; otherwise,
loader
is the
platform class loader
.
 Unless any of the resolved interfaces are non-public, this same value
 of
loader
is also the class loader passed to
Proxy.getProxyClass
; if non-public interfaces are present,
 their class loader is passed instead (if more than one non-public
 interface class loader is encountered, an
IllegalAccessError
is thrown).
 If
Proxy.getProxyClass
throws an
IllegalArgumentException
,
resolveProxyClass
will throw a
ClassNotFoundException
containing the
IllegalArgumentException
.
Parameters:
interfaces
- the list of interface names that were
                deserialized in the proxy class descriptor
Returns:
a proxy class for the specified interfaces
Throws:
IOException
- any exception thrown by the underlying
InputStream
ClassNotFoundException
- if the proxy class or any of the
                named interfaces could not be found

resolveObject
(
Object
obj)
throws
IOException
This method will allow trusted subclasses of ObjectInputStream to
 substitute one object for another during deserialization. Replacing
 objects is disabled until enableResolveObject is called. The
 enableResolveObject method checks that the stream requesting to resolve
 object can be trusted. Every reference to serializable objects is passed
 to resolveObject.  To ensure that the private state of objects is not
 unintentionally exposed only trusted streams may use resolveObject.
This method is called after an object has been read but before it is
 returned from readObject.  The default resolveObject method just returns
 the same object.
When a subclass is replacing objects it must ensure that the
 substituted object is compatible with every field where the reference
 will be stored.  Objects whose type is not a subclass of the type of the
 field or array element abort the deserialization by raising an exception
 and the object is not be stored.
This method is called only once when each object is first
 encountered.  All subsequent references to the object will be redirected
 to the new object.
Parameters:
obj
- object to be substituted
Returns:
the substituted object
Throws:
IOException
- Any of the usual Input/Output exceptions.
enableResolveObject
protected
boolean
enableResolveObject
(boolean enable)
throws
SecurityException
Enables the stream to do replacement of objects read from the stream. When
 enabled, the
resolveObject(java.lang.Object)
method is called for every object being
 deserialized.
If object replacement is currently not enabled, and
enable
is true, and there is a security manager installed,
 this method first calls the security manager's
checkPermission
method with the
SerializablePermission("enableSubstitution")
permission to
 ensure that the caller is permitted to enable the stream to do replacement
 of objects read from the stream.
Parameters:
enable
- true for enabling use of
resolveObject
for
          every object being deserialized
Returns:
the previous setting before this method was invoked
Throws:
SecurityException
- if a security manager exists and its
checkPermission
method denies enabling the stream
          to do replacement of objects read from the stream.

IOException
,
ClassNotFoundException
Read a class descriptor from the serialization stream.  This method is
 called when the ObjectInputStream expects a class descriptor as the next
 item in the serialization stream.  Subclasses of ObjectInputStream may
 override this method to read in class descriptors that have been written
 in non-standard formats (by subclasses of ObjectOutputStream which have
 overridden the
writeClassDescriptor
method).  By default,
 this method reads class descriptors according to the format defined in
 the Object Serialization specification.
Returns:
the class descriptor read
Throws:
IOException
- If an I/O error has occurred.
ClassNotFoundException
- If the Class of a serialized object used
          in the class descriptor representation cannot be found

getObjectInputFilter
public final
ObjectInputFilter
getObjectInputFilter
()
Returns the deserialization filter for this stream.
 The filter is the result of invoking the
JVM-wide filter factory
either by the
constructor
or the most recent invocation of
setObjectInputFilter
.
Returns:
the deserialization filter for the stream; may be null
Since:
9
setObjectInputFilter
public final
void
setObjectInputFilter
(
ObjectInputFilter
filter)
Set the deserialization filter for the stream.

 The deserialization filter is set to the filter returned by invoking the
JVM-wide filter factory
with the
current filter
and the
filter
parameter.
 The current filter was set in the
ObjectInputStream constructors
by invoking the
JVM-wide filter factory
and may be
null
.
setObjectInputFilter(ObjectInputFilter)
This method} can be called
 once and only once before reading any objects from the stream;
 for example, by calling
readObject()
or
readUnshared()
.
It is not permitted to replace a
non-null
filter with a
null
filter.
 If the
current filter
is
non-null
,
 the value returned from the filter factory must be
non-null
.
The filter's
checkInput
method is called
 for each class and reference in the stream.
 The filter can check any or all of the class, the array length, the number
 of references, the depth of the graph, and the size of the input stream.
 The depth is the number of nested
readObject
calls starting with the reading of the root of the graph being deserialized
 and the current object being deserialized.
 The number of references is the cumulative number of objects and references
 to objects already read from the stream including the current object being read.
 The filter is invoked only when reading objects from the stream and not for
 primitives.
If the filter returns
Status.REJECTED
,
null
or throws a
RuntimeException
,
 the active
readObject
or
readUnshared
throws
InvalidClassException
, otherwise deserialization
 continues uninterrupted.
Implementation Requirements:
The filter, when not
null
, is invoked during
readObject
and
readUnshared
for each object (regular or class) in the stream.
 Strings are treated as primitives and do not invoke the filter.
 The filter is called for:
each object reference previously deserialized from the stream
     (class is
null
, arrayLength is -1),
each regular class (class is not
null
, arrayLength is -1),
each interface class explicitly referenced in the stream
         (it is not called for interfaces implemented by classes in the stream),
each interface of a dynamic proxy and the dynamic proxy class itself
     (class is not
null
, arrayLength is -1),
each array is filtered using the array type and length of the array
     (class is the array type, arrayLength is the requested length),
each object replaced by its class'
readResolve
method
         is filtered using the replacement object's class, if not
null
,
         and if it is an array, the arrayLength, otherwise -1,
and each object replaced by
resolveObject
is filtered using the replacement object's class, if not
null
,
         and if it is an array, the arrayLength, otherwise -1.
When the
checkInput
method is invoked
 it is given access to the current class, the array length,
 the current number of references already read from the stream,
 the depth of nested calls to
readObject
or
readUnshared
,
 and the implementation dependent number of bytes consumed from the input stream.
Each call to
readObject
or
readUnshared
increases the depth by 1
 before reading an object and decreases by 1 before returning
 normally or exceptionally.
 The depth starts at
1
and increases for each nested object and
 decrements when each nested call returns.
 The count of references in the stream starts at
1
and
 is increased before reading an object.
Parameters:
filter
- the filter, may be null
Throws:
SecurityException
- if there is security manager and the
SerializablePermission("serialFilter")
is not granted
IllegalStateException
- if an object has been read,
       if the filter factory returns
null
when the
current filter
is non-null, or
       if the filter has already been set.
