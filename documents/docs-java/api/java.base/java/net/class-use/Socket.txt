Socket
Package
Description
java.net
Provides the classes for implementing networking applications.

javax.net
Provides classes for networking applications.
javax.net.ssl
Provides classes for the secure socket package.
javax.rmi.ssl
Provides implementations of
RMIClientSocketFactory
and
RMIServerSocketFactory
over
 the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.
