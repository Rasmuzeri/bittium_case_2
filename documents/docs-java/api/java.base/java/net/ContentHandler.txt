Class ContentHandler
java.lang.Object
java.net.ContentHandler
public abstract class
ContentHandler
extends
Object
The abstract class
ContentHandler
is the superclass
 of all classes that read an
Object
from a
URLConnection
.
An application does not generally call the
getContent
method in this class directly. Instead, an
 application calls the
getContent
method in class
URL
or in
URLConnection
.
 The application's content handler factory (an instance of a class that
 implements the interface
ContentHandlerFactory
set up by a call to
setContentHandlerFactory
) is called with a
String
giving the
 MIME type of the object being received on the socket. The factory returns an
 instance of a subclass of
ContentHandler
, and its
getContent
method is called to create the object.
If no content handler could be
found
,
 URLConnection will look for a content handler in a user-definable set of places.
 Users can define a vertical-bar delimited set of class prefixes
 to search through by defining the
java.content.handler.pkgs
system
 property. The class name must be of the form:
{package-prefix}.{major}.{minor}
where
{major}.{minor}
is formed by taking the
     content-type string, replacing all slash characters with a
period
('.'), and all other non-alphanumeric characters
     with the underscore character '
_
'. The alphanumeric
     characters are specifically the 26 uppercase ASCII letters
     '
A
' through '
Z
', the 26 lowercase ASCII
     letters '
a
' through '
z
', and the 10 ASCII
     digits '
0
' through '
9
'.
e.g.
     YoyoDyne.experimental.text.plain
If no user-defined content handler is found, then the system
 tries to load a specific
content-type
handler from one
 of the built-in handlers, if one exists.
If the loading of the content handler class would be performed by
 a classloader that is outside of the delegation chain of the caller,
 the JVM will need the RuntimePermission "getClassLoader".

throws

Given a URL connect stream positioned at the beginning of the
 representation of an object, this method reads that stream and
 creates an object from it.
Parameters:
urlc
- a URL connection.
Returns:
the object read by the
ContentHandler
.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs while reading the object.

throws
IOException
Given a URL connect stream positioned at the beginning of the
 representation of an object, this method reads that stream and
 creates an object that matches one of the types specified.

 The default implementation of this method should call
getContent(URLConnection)
and screen the return type for a match of the suggested types.
Parameters:
urlc
- a URL connection.
classes
- an array of types requested
Returns:
the object read by the
ContentHandler
that is
                 the first match of the suggested types or
null
if none of the requested  are supported.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs while reading the object.
