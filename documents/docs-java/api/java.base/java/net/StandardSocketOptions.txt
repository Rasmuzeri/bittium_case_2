Field Details
SO_BROADCAST
public static final
SocketOption
<
Boolean
>
SO_BROADCAST
Allow transmission of broadcast datagrams.
The value of this socket option is a
Boolean
that represents
 whether the option is enabled or disabled. The option is specific to
 datagram-oriented sockets sending to
IPv4
broadcast addresses. When the socket option is enabled then the socket
 can be used to send
broadcast datagrams
.
The initial value of this socket option is
FALSE
. The socket
 option may be enabled or disabled at any time. Some operating systems may
 require that the Java virtual machine be started with implementation
 specific privileges to enable this option or send broadcast datagrams.

SO_KEEPALIVE
public static final
SocketOption
<
Boolean
>
SO_KEEPALIVE
Keep connection alive.
The value of this socket option is a
Boolean
that represents
 whether the option is enabled or disabled. When the
SO_KEEPALIVE
option is enabled the operating system may use a
keep-alive
mechanism to periodically probe the other end of a connection when the
 connection is otherwise idle. The exact semantics of the keep alive
 mechanism is system dependent and therefore unspecified.
The initial value of this socket option is
FALSE
. The socket
 option may be enabled or disabled at any time.

SO_SNDBUF
public static final
SocketOption
<
Integer
>
SO_SNDBUF
The size of the socket send buffer.
The value of this socket option is an
Integer
that is the
 size of the socket send buffer in bytes. The socket send buffer is an
 output buffer used by the networking implementation. It may need to be
 increased for high-volume connections. The value of the socket option is
 a
hint
to the implementation to size the buffer and the actual
 size may differ. The socket option can be queried to retrieve the actual
 size.
For datagram-oriented sockets, the size of the send buffer may limit
 the size of the datagrams that may be sent by the socket. Whether
 datagrams larger than the buffer size are sent or discarded is system
 dependent.
The initial/default size of the socket send buffer and the range of
 allowable values is system dependent although a negative size is not
 allowed. An attempt to set the socket send buffer to larger than its
 maximum size causes it to be set to its maximum size.
An implementation allows this socket option to be set before the
 socket is bound or connected. Whether an implementation allows the
 socket send buffer to be changed after the socket is bound is system
 dependent.

Socket.setSendBufferSize(int)
SO_RCVBUF
public static final
SocketOption
<
Integer
>
SO_RCVBUF
The size of the socket receive buffer.
The value of this socket option is an
Integer
that is the
 size of the socket receive buffer in bytes. The socket receive buffer is
 an input buffer used by the networking implementation. It may need to be
 increased for high-volume connections or decreased to limit the possible
 backlog of incoming data. The value of the socket option is a
hint
to the implementation to size the buffer and the actual
 size may differ.
For datagram-oriented sockets, the size of the receive buffer may
 limit the size of the datagrams that can be received. Whether datagrams
 larger than the buffer size can be received is system dependent.
 Increasing the socket receive buffer may be important for cases where
 datagrams arrive in bursts faster than they can be processed.
In the case of stream-oriented sockets and the TCP/IP protocol, the
 size of the socket receive buffer may be used when advertising the size
 of the TCP receive window to the remote peer.
The initial/default size of the socket receive buffer and the range
 of allowable values is system dependent although a negative size is not
 allowed. An attempt to set the socket receive buffer to larger than its
 maximum size causes it to be set to its maximum size.
An implementation allows this socket option to be set before the
 socket is bound or connected. Whether an implementation allows the
 socket receive buffer to be changed after the socket is bound is system
 dependent.

SO_REUSEADDR
public static final
SocketOption
<
Boolean
>
SO_REUSEADDR
Re-use address.
The value of this socket option is a
Boolean
that represents
 whether the option is enabled or disabled. The exact semantics of this
 socket option are socket type and system dependent.
In the case of stream-oriented sockets, this socket option will
 usually determine whether the socket can be bound to a socket address
 when a previous connection involving that socket address is in the
TIME_WAIT
state. On implementations where the semantics differ,
 and the socket option is not required to be enabled in order to bind the
 socket when a previous connection is in this state, then the
 implementation may choose to ignore this option.
For datagram-oriented sockets the socket option is used to allow
 multiple programs bind to the same address. This option should be enabled
 when the socket is to be used for Internet Protocol (IP) multicasting.
An implementation allows this socket option to be set before the
 socket is bound or connected. Changing the value of this socket option
 after the socket is bound has no effect. The default value of this
 socket option is system dependent.

SO_REUSEPORT
public static final
SocketOption
<
Boolean
>
SO_REUSEPORT
Re-use port.
The value of this socket option is a
Boolean
that represents
 whether the option is enabled or disabled. The exact semantics of this
 socket option are socket type and system dependent.
In the case of stream-oriented sockets, this socket option usually allows
 multiple listening sockets to be bound to both same address
 and same port.
For datagram-oriented sockets the socket option usually allows
 multiple UDP sockets to be bound to the same address and port.
An implementation allows this socket option to be set before the
 socket is bound or connected. Changing the value of this socket option
 after the socket is bound has no effect.

SO_LINGER
public static final
SocketOption
<
Integer
>
SO_LINGER
Linger on close if data is present.
The value of this socket option is an
Integer
that controls
 the action taken when unsent data is queued on the socket and a method
 to close the socket is invoked. If the value of the socket option is zero
 or greater, then it represents a timeout value, in seconds, known as the
linger interval
. The linger interval is the timeout for the
close
method to block while the operating system attempts to
 transmit the unsent data or it decides that it is unable to transmit the
 data. If the value of the socket option is less than zero then the option
 is disabled. In that case the
close
method does not wait until
 unsent data is transmitted; if possible the operating system will transmit
 any unsent data before the connection is closed.
This socket option is intended for use with sockets that are configured
 in
blocking
mode
 only. The behavior of the
close
method when this option is
 enabled on a non-blocking socket is not defined.
The initial value of this socket option is a negative value, meaning
 that the option is disabled. The option may be enabled, or the linger
 interval changed, at any time. The maximum value of the linger interval
 is system dependent. Setting the linger interval to a value that is
 greater than its maximum value causes the linger interval to be set to
 its maximum value.

IP_TOS
public static final
SocketOption
<
Integer
>
IP_TOS
The Type of Service (ToS) octet in the Internet Protocol (IP) header.
The value of this socket option is an
Integer
representing
 the value of the ToS octet in IP packets sent by sockets to an
IPv4
socket. The interpretation of the ToS
 octet is network specific and is not defined by this class. Further
 information on the ToS octet can be found in
RFC 1349
and
RFC 2474
. The value
 of the socket option is a
hint
. An implementation may ignore the
 value, or ignore specific values.
The initial/default value of the TOS field in the ToS octet is
 implementation specific but will typically be
0
. For
 datagram-oriented sockets the option may be configured at any time after
 the socket has been bound. The new value of the octet is used when sending
 subsequent datagrams. It is system dependent whether this option can be
 queried or changed prior to binding the socket.
The behavior of this socket option on a stream-oriented socket, or an
IPv6
socket, is not defined in this
 release.

IP_MULTICAST_IF
public static final
SocketOption
<
NetworkInterface
>
IP_MULTICAST_IF
The network interface for Internet Protocol (IP) multicast datagrams.
The value of this socket option is a
NetworkInterface
that
 represents the outgoing interface for multicast datagrams sent by the
 datagram-oriented socket. For
IPv6
sockets then it is system dependent whether setting this option also
 sets the outgoing interface for multicast datagrams sent to IPv4
 addresses.
The initial/default value of this socket option may be
null
to indicate that outgoing interface will be selected by the operating
 system, typically based on the network routing tables. An implementation
 allows this socket option to be set after the socket is bound. Whether
 the socket option can be queried or changed prior to binding the socket
 is system dependent.

IP_MULTICAST_TTL
public static final
SocketOption
<
Integer
>
IP_MULTICAST_TTL
The
time-to-live
for Internet Protocol (IP) multicast datagrams.
The value of this socket option is an
Integer
in the range
0 <= value <= 255
. It is used to control the scope of multicast
 datagrams sent by the datagram-oriented socket.
 In the case of an
IPv4
socket
 the option is the time-to-live (TTL) on multicast datagrams sent by the
 socket. Datagrams with a TTL of zero are not transmitted on the network
 but may be delivered locally. In the case of an
IPv6
socket the option is the
hop limit
which is number of
hops
that the datagram can
 pass through before expiring on the network. For IPv6 sockets it is
 system dependent whether the option also sets the
time-to-live
on multicast datagrams sent to IPv4 addresses.
The initial/default value of the time-to-live setting is typically
1
. An implementation allows this socket option to be set after
 the socket is bound. Whether the socket option can be queried or changed
 prior to binding the socket is system dependent.

IP_MULTICAST_LOOP
public static final
SocketOption
<
Boolean
>
IP_MULTICAST_LOOP
Loopback for Internet Protocol (IP) multicast datagrams.
The value of this socket option is a
Boolean
that controls
 the
loopback
of multicast datagrams. The value of the socket
 option represents if the option is enabled or disabled.
The exact semantics of this socket options are system dependent.
 In particular, it is system dependent whether the loopback applies to
 multicast datagrams sent from the socket or received by the socket.
 For
IPv6
sockets then it is
 system dependent whether the option also applies to multicast datagrams
 sent to IPv4 addresses.
The initial/default value of this socket option is
TRUE
. An
 implementation allows this socket option to be set after the socket is
 bound. Whether the socket option can be queried or changed prior to
 binding the socket is system dependent.

TCP_NODELAY
public static final
SocketOption
<
Boolean
>
TCP_NODELAY
Disable the Nagle algorithm.
The value of this socket option is a
Boolean
that represents
 whether the option is enabled or disabled. The socket option is specific to
 stream-oriented sockets using the TCP/IP protocol. TCP/IP uses an algorithm
 known as
The Nagle Algorithm
to coalesce short segments and
 improve network efficiency.
The default value of this socket option is
FALSE
. The
 socket option should only be enabled in cases where it is known that the
 coalescing impacts performance. The socket option may be enabled at any
 time. In other words, the Nagle Algorithm can be disabled. Once the option
 is enabled, it is system dependent whether it can be subsequently
 disabled. If it cannot, then invoking the
setOption
method to
 disable the option has no effect.
