Class URLDecoder

public class
URLDecoder
extends
Object
Utility class for HTML form decoding. This class contains static methods
 for decoding a String from the
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
MIME format.
The conversion process is the reverse of that used by the URLEncoder class. It is assumed
 that all characters in the encoded string are one of the following:
 "
a
" through "
z
",
 "
A
" through "
Z
",
 "
0
" through "
9
", and
 "
-
", "
_
",
 "
.
", and "
*
". The
 character "
%
" is allowed but is interpreted
 as the start of a special escaped sequence.
The following rules are applied in the conversion:
The alphanumeric characters "
a
" through
     "
z
", "
A
" through
     "
Z
" and "
0
"
     through "
9
" remain the same.
The special characters "
.
",
     "
-
", "
*
", and
     "
_
" remain the same.
The plus sign "
+
" is converted into a
     space character "   " .
A sequence of the form "
%xy
" will be
     treated as representing a byte where
xy
is the two-digit
     hexadecimal representation of the 8 bits. Then, all substrings
     that contain one or more of these byte sequences consecutively
     will be replaced by the character(s) whose encoding would result
     in those consecutive bytes.
     The encoding scheme used to decode these characters may be specified,
     or if unspecified, the default charset will be used.
There are two possible ways in which this decoder could deal with
 illegal strings.  It could either leave illegal characters alone or
 it could throw an
IllegalArgumentException
.
 Which approach the decoder takes is left to the
 implementation.

Method Details
decode
@Deprecated
public static
String
decode
(
String
s)
Deprecated.
The resulting string may vary depending on the
          default charset. Instead, use the decode(String,String) method
          to specify the encoding.
Decodes a
x-www-form-urlencoded
string.
 The default charset is used to determine what characters
 are represented by any consecutive sequences of the form
 "
%xy
".
Parameters:
s
- the
String
to decode
Returns:
the newly decoded
String
decode
public static
String
decode
(
String
s,
String
enc)
throws
UnsupportedEncodingException
Decodes an
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
string using
 a specific encoding scheme.
This method behaves the same as
decode(java.lang.String,java.nio.charset.Charset)
except that it will
look up the charset
using the given encoding name.
Implementation Note:
This implementation will throw an
IllegalArgumentException
when illegal strings are encountered.
Parameters:
s
- the
String
to decode
enc
- The name of a supported
character
    encoding
.
Returns:
the newly decoded
String
Throws:
UnsupportedEncodingException
- If character encoding needs to be consulted, but
             named character encoding is not supported
Since:
1.4

URLEncoder.encode(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)
decode
public static
String
decode
(
String
s,
Charset
charset)
Decodes an
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
string using
 a specific
Charset
.
 The supplied charset is used to determine
 what characters are represented by any consecutive sequences of the
 form "
%xy
".
Note:
The
World Wide Web Consortium Recommendation
states that
 UTF-8 should be used. Not doing so may introduce
 incompatibilities.
Implementation Note:
This implementation will throw an
IllegalArgumentException
when illegal strings are encountered.
Parameters:
s
- the
String
to decode
charset
- the given charset
Returns:
the newly decoded
String
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
s
or
charset
is
null
IllegalArgumentException
- if the implementation encounters illegal
 characters
