Class InterfaceAddress
java.lang.Object
java.net.InterfaceAddress
public class
InterfaceAddress
extends
Object
This class represents a Network Interface address. In short it's an
 IP address, a subnet mask and a broadcast address when the address is
 an IPv4 one. An IP address and a network prefix length in the case
 of IPv6 address.
Since:
1.6

Method Details
getAddress
public
InetAddress
getAddress
()
Returns an
InetAddress
for this address.
Returns:
the
InetAddress
for this address.
getBroadcast
public
InetAddress
getBroadcast
()
Returns an
InetAddress
for the broadcast address
 for this InterfaceAddress.
Only IPv4 networks have broadcast address therefore, in the case
 of an IPv6 network,
null
will be returned.
Returns:
the
InetAddress
representing the broadcast
         address or
null
if there is no broadcast address.
getNetworkPrefixLength
public
short
getNetworkPrefixLength
()
Returns the network prefix length for this address. This is also known
 as the subnet mask in the context of IPv4 addresses.
 Typical IPv4 values would be 8 (255.0.0.0), 16 (255.255.0.0)
 or 24 (255.255.255.0).
Typical IPv6 values would be 128 (::1/128) or 10 (fe80::203:baff:fe27:1243/10)
Returns:
a
short
representing the prefix length for the
         subnet of that address.
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Compares this object against the specified object.
 The result is
true
if and only if the argument is
 not
null
and it represents the same interface address as
 this object.
Two instances of
InterfaceAddress
represent the same
 address if the InetAddress, the prefix length and the broadcast are
 the same for both.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- the object to compare against.
Returns:
true
if the objects are the same;
false
otherwise.

hashCode()
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Returns a hashcode for this Interface address.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
a hash code value for this Interface address.
See Also:
Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)
toString
public
String
toString
()
Converts this Interface address to a
String
. The
 string returned is of the form: InetAddress / prefix length [ broadcast address ].
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
a string representation of this Interface address.
