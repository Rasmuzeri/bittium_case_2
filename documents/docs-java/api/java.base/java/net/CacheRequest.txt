Class CacheRequest
java.lang.Object
java.net.CacheRequest
public abstract class
CacheRequest
extends
Object
Represents channels for storing resources in the
 ResponseCache. Instances of such a class provide an
 OutputStream object which is called by protocol handlers to
 store the resource data into the cache, and also an abort() method
 which allows a cache store operation to be interrupted and
 abandoned. If an IOException is encountered while reading the
 response or writing to the cache, the current cache store operation
 will be aborted.
