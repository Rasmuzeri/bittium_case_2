Utility class for HTML form encoding. This class contains static methods
 for converting a String to the
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
MIME
 format. For more information about HTML form encoding, consult the HTML
specification
.
When encoding a String, the following rules apply:
The alphanumeric characters "
a
" through
     "
z
", "
A
" through
     "
Z
" and "
0
"
     through "
9
" remain the same.
The special characters "
.
",
     "
-
", "
*
", and
     "
_
" remain the same.
The space character "   " is
     converted into a plus sign "
+
".
All other characters are unsafe and are first converted into
     one or more bytes using some encoding scheme. Then each byte is
     represented by the 3-character string
     "
%xy
", where
xy
is the
     two-digit hexadecimal representation of the byte.
     The recommended encoding scheme to use is UTF-8. However,
     for compatibility reasons, if an encoding is not specified,
     then the default charset is used.
For example using UTF-8 as the encoding scheme the string "The
 string ü@foo-bar" would get converted to
 "The+string+%C3%BC%40foo-bar" because in UTF-8 the character
 ü is encoded as two bytes C3 (hex) and BC (hex), and the
 character @ is encoded as one byte 40 (hex).

The resulting string may vary depending on the
             default charset. Instead, use the encode(String,String)
             method to specify the encoding.
Translates a string into
x-www-form-urlencoded
format. This method uses the default charset
 as the encoding scheme to obtain the bytes for unsafe characters.
Parameters:
s
-
String
to be translated.
Returns:
the translated
String
.

UnsupportedEncodingException
Translates a string into
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
format using a specific encoding scheme.
This method behaves the same as
encode(String s, Charset charset)
except that it will
look up the charset
using the given encoding name.
Parameters:
s
-
String
to be translated.
enc
- The name of a supported
character
    encoding
.
Returns:
the translated
String
.
Throws:
UnsupportedEncodingException
- If the named encoding is not supported

charset)
Translates a string into
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
format using a specific
Charset
.
 This method uses the supplied charset to obtain the bytes for unsafe
 characters.
Note:
The
World Wide Web Consortium Recommendation
states that
 UTF-8 should be used. Not doing so may introduce incompatibilities.
Parameters:
s
-
String
to be translated.
charset
- the given charset
Returns:
the translated
String
.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
s
or
charset
is
null
.
