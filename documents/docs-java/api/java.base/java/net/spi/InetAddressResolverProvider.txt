Class InetAddressResolverProvider
java.lang.Object
java.net.spi.InetAddressResolverProvider
public abstract class
InetAddressResolverProvider
extends
Object
Service-provider class for
InetAddress resolvers
.
A resolver provider is a factory for custom implementations of
InetAddress resolvers
. A resolver defines operations for
 looking up (resolving) host names and IP addresses.
A resolver provider is a concrete subclass of this class that has a
 zero-argument constructor and implements the abstract methods specified below.
A given invocation of the Java virtual machine maintains a single
 system-wide resolver instance, which is used by
InetAddress
. It is set after the VM is fully initialized and when an
 invocation of a method in
InetAddress
class triggers the first lookup
 operation.
A resolver provider is located and loaded by
InetAddress
to create the system-wide resolver as follows:
The
ServiceLoader
mechanism is used to locate an
InetAddressResolverProvider
using the
      system class loader. The order in which providers are located is
implementation specific
.
      The first provider found will be used to instantiate the
InetAddressResolver
by invoking the
get(InetAddressResolverProvider.Configuration)
method. The returned
InetAddressResolver
will be set as the
      system-wide resolver.
If the previous step fails to find any resolver provider the
built-in resolver
will be set as the system-wide resolver.
If instantiating a custom resolver from a provider discovered in
 step 1 throws an error or exception, the system-wide resolver will not be
 set and the error or exception will be propagated to the caller of the method
 that triggered the lookup operation.
 Otherwise, any lookup operation will be performed using the
system-wide resolver
.
Implementation Note:
InetAddress
will use the
built-in resolver
for any lookup operation
 that might occur before the VM is fully booted.

Constructor Details
InetAddressResolverProvider
protected
InetAddressResolverProvider
()
Creates a new instance of
InetAddressResolverProvider
.
Implementation Note:
It is recommended that an
InetAddressResolverProvider
service
 implementation initialization should be as simple as possible, in order to avoid
 possible risks of deadlock or class loading cycles during the instantiation of the
 service provider.
Throws:
SecurityException
- if a security manager is present and its
checkPermission
method doesn't allow the
RuntimePermission("inetAddressResolverProvider")
.
Method Details
get
public abstract
InetAddressResolver
get
(
InetAddressResolverProvider.Configuration
configuration)
Initialize and return an
InetAddressResolver
provided by
 this provider. This method is called by
InetAddress
when
installing
the system-wide resolver implementation.
Any error or exception thrown by this method is considered as
 a failure of
InetAddressResolver
instantiation and will be propagated to
 the caller of the method that triggered the lookup operation.
Parameters:
configuration
- a
InetAddressResolverProvider.Configuration
instance containing platform built-in address
                     resolution configuration.
Returns:
the resolver provided by this provider
name

String
name
()
Returns the name of this provider, or

if unnamed.
Returns:
the name of this provider, or
