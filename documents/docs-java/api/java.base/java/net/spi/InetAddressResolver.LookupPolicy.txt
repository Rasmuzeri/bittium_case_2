Class InetAddressResolver.LookupPolicy
java.lang.Object
java.net.spi.InetAddressResolver.LookupPolicy
Enclosing interface:
InetAddressResolver
public static final class
InetAddressResolver.LookupPolicy
extends
Object
A
LookupPolicy
object describes characteristics that can be applied to a lookup operation.
 In particular, it is used to specify the ordering and which filtering should be performed when
looking up host addresses
.
The default platform-wide lookup policy is constructed by consulting
System Properties
which affect
 how IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are returned.
Since:
18

Method Details
of
public static
InetAddressResolver.LookupPolicy
of
(int characteristics)
This factory method creates a
LookupPolicy
instance with
 the given
characteristics
value.
The
characteristics
value is an integer bit mask which defines
 parameters of a forward lookup operation. These parameters define at least:
the family type of the returned addresses
the order in which a
resolver
implementation should return its results
To request addresses of specific family types the following bit masks can be combined:
IPV4
: to request IPv4 addresses
IPV6
: to request IPv6 addresses
It is an error if neither
IPV4
or
IPV6
are set.
To request a specific ordering of the results:
IPV4_FIRST
: return IPv4 addresses before any IPv6 address
IPV6_FIRST
: return IPv6 addresses before any IPv4 address
If neither
IPV4_FIRST
or
IPV6_FIRST
are set it
 implies
"system"
order of addresses.
 It is an error to request both
IPV4_FIRST
and
IPV6_FIRST
.
Parameters:
characteristics
- a value which represents the set of lookup characteristics
Returns:
an instance of
InetAddressResolver.LookupPolicy
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if an illegal characteristics bit mask is provided
