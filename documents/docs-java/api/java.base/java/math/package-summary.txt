java.math
Provides classes for performing arbitrary-precision integer
 arithmetic (
BigInteger
) and arbitrary-precision decimal
 arithmetic (
BigDecimal
).
BigInteger
is analogous
 to the primitive integer types except that it provides arbitrary
 precision, hence operations on
BigInteger
s do not overflow
 or lose precision.  In addition to standard arithmetic operations,
BigInteger
provides modular arithmetic, GCD calculation,
 primality testing, prime generation, bit manipulation, and a few
 other miscellaneous operations.
BigDecimal
provides arbitrary-precision signed decimal
 numbers suitable for currency calculations and the like.
BigDecimal
gives the user complete control over rounding behavior,
 allowing the user to choose from a comprehensive set of eight
 rounding modes.

Description
BigDecimal
Immutable, arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers.
BigInteger
Immutable arbitrary-precision integers.
MathContext
Immutable objects which encapsulate the context settings which
 describe certain rules for numerical operators, such as those
 implemented by the
BigDecimal
class.
RoundingMode
Specifies a
rounding policy
for numerical operations capable
 of discarding precision.
