Uses of Package
java.math
Packages that use
java.math
Package
Description
java.awt.image
Provides classes for creating and modifying images.
java.math
Provides classes for performing arbitrary-precision integer
 arithmetic (
BigInteger
) and arbitrary-precision decimal
 arithmetic (
BigDecimal
).
java.security.cert
Provides classes and interfaces for parsing and managing
 certificates, certificate revocation lists (CRLs), and
 certification paths.
java.security.interfaces
Provides interfaces for generating RSA (Rivest, Shamir and
 Adleman AsymmetricCipher algorithm)
 keys as defined in the RSA Laboratory Technical Note
 PKCS#1, and DSA (Digital Signature
 Algorithm) keys as defined in NIST's FIPS-186.
java.security.spec
Provides classes and interfaces for key specifications and algorithm
 parameter specifications.
java.sql
Provides the API for accessing and processing data stored in a
 data source (usually a relational database) using the
 Java programming language.
java.text
Provides classes and interfaces for handling text, dates, numbers,
 and messages in a manner independent of natural languages.
java.util
Contains the collections framework, some internationalization support classes,
 a service loader, properties, random number generation, string parsing
 and scanning classes, base64 encoding and decoding, a bit array, and
 several miscellaneous utility classes.
java.util.random
This package contains classes and interfaces that support a generic API
 for random number generation.
javax.crypto.interfaces

 Laboratories' PKCS #3.
javax.crypto.spec
Provides classes and interfaces for key specifications and
 algorithm parameter specifications.
javax.management.openmbean
