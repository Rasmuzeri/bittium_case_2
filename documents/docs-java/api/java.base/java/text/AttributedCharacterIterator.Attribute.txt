public static final
AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute
READING
Attribute key for the reading of some text. In languages where the written form
 and the pronunciation of a word are only loosely related (such as Japanese),
 it is often necessary to store the reading (pronunciation) along with the
 written form.
Values are instances of
Annotation
holding instances of
String
.

String
INPUT_METHOD_SEGMENT
public static final
AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute
INPUT_METHOD_SEGMENT
Attribute key for input method segments. Input methods often break
 up text into segments, which usually correspond to words.
Values are instances of
Annotation
holding a
