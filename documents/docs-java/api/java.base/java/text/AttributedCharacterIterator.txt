Interface AttributedCharacterIterator

CharacterIterator
,
Cloneable
public interface
AttributedCharacterIterator
extends
CharacterIterator
An
AttributedCharacterIterator
allows iteration through both text and
 related attribute information.
An attribute is a key/value pair, identified by the key.  No two
 attributes on a given character can have the same key.
The values for an attribute are immutable, or must not be mutated
 by clients or storage.  They are always passed by reference, and not
 cloned.
A
run with respect to an attribute
is a maximum text range for
 which:
the attribute is undefined or
null
for the entire range, or
the attribute value is defined and has the same non-
null
value for the
     entire range.
A
run with respect to a set of attributes
is a maximum text range for
 which this condition is met for each member attribute.
When getting a run with no explicit attributes specified (i.e.,
 calling
getRunStart()
and
getRunLimit()
), any
 contiguous text segments having the same attributes (the same set
 of attribute/value pairs) are treated as separate runs if the
 attributes have been given to those text segments separately.
The returned indexes are limited to the range of the iterator.
The returned attribute information is limited to runs that contain
 the current character.
Attribute keys are instances of
AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute
and its
 subclasses, such as
TextAttribute
.
