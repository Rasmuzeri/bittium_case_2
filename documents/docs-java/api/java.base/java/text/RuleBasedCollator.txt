Collator
The
RuleBasedCollator
class is a concrete subclass of
Collator
that provides a simple, data-driven, table
 collator.  With this class you can create a customized table-based
Collator
.
RuleBasedCollator
maps
 characters to sort keys.
RuleBasedCollator
has the following restrictions
 for efficiency (other subclasses may be used for more complex languages) :
If a special collation rule controlled by a <modifier> is
     specified it applies to the whole collator object.
All non-mentioned characters are at the end of the
     collation order.
The collation table is composed of a list of collation rules, where each
 rule is of one of three forms:
<modifier>
    <relation> <text-argument>
    <reset> <text-argument>
The definitions of the rule elements is as follows:
Text-Argument
: A text-argument is any sequence of
        characters, excluding special characters (that is, common
        whitespace characters [0009-000D, 0020] and rule syntax characters
        [0021-002F, 003A-0040, 005B-0060, 007B-007E]). If those
        characters are desired, you can put them in single quotes
        (e.g. ampersand => '&'). Note that unquoted white space characters
        are ignored; e.g.
b c
is treated as
bc
.
Modifier
: There are currently two modifiers that
        turn on special collation rules.
'@' : Turns on backwards sorting of accents (secondary
                      differences), as in French.
'!' : Turns on Thai/Lao vowel-consonant swapping.  If this
                      rule is in force when a Thai vowel of the range
                      \U0E40-\U0E44 precedes a Thai consonant of the range
                      \U0E01-\U0E2E OR a Lao vowel of the range \U0EC0-\U0EC4
                      precedes a Lao consonant of the range \U0E81-\U0EAE then
                      the vowel is placed after the consonant for collation
                      purposes.
'@' : Indicates that accents are sorted backwards, as in French.
Relation
: The relations are the following:
'<' : Greater, as a letter difference (primary)
';' : Greater, as an accent difference (secondary)
',' : Greater, as a case difference (tertiary)
'=' : Equal
Reset
: There is a single reset
        which is used primarily for contractions and expansions, but which
        can also be used to add a modification at the end of a set of rules.
'&' : Indicates that the next rule follows the position to where
            the reset text-argument would be sorted.
This sounds more complicated than it is in practice. For example, the
 following are equivalent ways of expressing the same thing:
a < b < c
 a < b & b < c
 a < c & a < b
Notice that the order is important, as the subsequent item goes immediately
 after the text-argument. The following are not equivalent:
a < b & a < c
 a < c & a < b
Either the text-argument must already be present in the sequence, or some
 initial substring of the text-argument must be present. (e.g. "a < b & ae <
 e" is valid since "a" is present in the sequence before "ae" is reset). In
 this latter case, "ae" is not entered and treated as a single character;
 instead, "e" is sorted as if it were expanded to two characters: "a"
 followed by an "e". This difference appears in natural languages: in
 traditional Spanish "ch" is treated as though it contracts to a single
 character (expressed as "c < ch < d"), while in traditional German
 a-umlaut is treated as though it expanded to two characters
 (expressed as "a,A < b,B ... &ae;\u00e3&AE;\u00c3").
 [\u00e3 and \u00c3 are, of course, the escape sequences for a-umlaut.]
Ignorable Characters
For ignorable characters, the first rule must start with a relation (the
 examples we have used above are really fragments; "a < b" really should be
 "< a < b"). If, however, the first relation is not "<", then all the all
 text-arguments up to the first "<" are ignorable. For example, ", - < a < b"
 makes "-" an ignorable character, as we saw earlier in the word
 "black-birds". In the samples for different languages, you see that most
 accents are ignorable.
Normalization and Accents
RuleBasedCollator
automatically processes its rule table to
 include both pre-composed and combining-character versions of
 accented characters.  Even if the provided rule string contains only
 base characters and separate combining accent characters, the pre-composed
 accented characters matching all canonical combinations of characters from
 the rule string will be entered in the table.
This allows you to use a RuleBasedCollator to compare accented strings
 even when the collator is set to NO_DECOMPOSITION.  There are two caveats,
 however.  First, if the strings to be collated contain combining
 sequences that may not be in canonical order, you should set the collator to
 CANONICAL_DECOMPOSITION or FULL_DECOMPOSITION to enable sorting of
 combining sequences.  Second, if the strings contain characters with
 compatibility decompositions (such as full-width and half-width forms),
 you must use FULL_DECOMPOSITION, since the rule tables only include
 canonical mappings.
Errors
The following are errors:
A text-argument contains unquoted punctuation symbols
        (e.g. "a < b-c < d").
A relation or reset character not followed by a text-argument
        (e.g. "a < ,b").
A reset where the text-argument (or an initial substring of the
         text-argument) is not already in the sequence.
         (e.g. "a < b & e < f")
If you produce one of these errors, a
RuleBasedCollator
throws
 a
ParseException
.
Examples
Simple:     "< a < b < c < d"
Norwegian:  "< a, A < b, B < c, C < d, D < e, E < f, F
                 < g, G < h, H < i, I < j, J < k, K < l, L
                 < m, M < n, N < o, O < p, P < q, Q < r, R
                 < s, S < t, T < u, U < v, V < w, W < x, X
                 < y, Y < z, Z
                 < \u00E6, \u00C6
                 < \u00F8, \u00D8
                 < \u00E5 = a\u030A, \u00C5 = A\u030A;
                      aa, AA"
To create a
RuleBasedCollator
object with specialized
 rules tailored to your needs, you construct the
RuleBasedCollator
with the rules contained in a
String
object. For example:
String simple = "< a< b< c< d";
 RuleBasedCollator mySimple = new RuleBasedCollator(simple);
Or:
String Norwegian = "< a, A < b, B < c, C < d, D < e, E < f, F < g, G < h, H < i, I" +
                    "< j, J < k, K < l, L < m, M < n, N < o, O < p, P < q, Q < r, R" +
                    "< s, S < t, T < u, U < v, V < w, W < x, X < y, Y < z, Z" +
                    "< \u00E6, \u00C6" +     // Latin letter ae & AE
                    "< \u00F8, \u00D8" +     // Latin letter o & O with stroke
                    "< \u00E5 = a\u030A," +  // Latin letter a with ring above
                    "  \u00C5 = A\u030A;" +  // Latin letter A with ring above
                    "  aa, AA";
 RuleBasedCollator myNorwegian = new RuleBasedCollator(Norwegian);
A new collation rules string can be created by concatenating rules
 strings. For example, the rules returned by
getRules()
could
 be concatenated to combine multiple
RuleBasedCollator
s.
The following example demonstrates how to change the order of
 non-spacing accents,
// old rule
 String oldRules = "=\u0301;\u0300;\u0302;\u0308"    // main accents
                 + ";\u0327;\u0303;\u0304;\u0305"    // main accents
                 + ";\u0306;\u0307;\u0309;\u030A"    // main accents
                 + ";\u030B;\u030C;\u030D;\u030E"    // main accents
                 + ";\u030F;\u0310;\u0311;\u0312"    // main accents
                 + "< a , A ; ae, AE ; \u00e6 , \u00c6"
                 + "< b , B < c, C < e, E & C < d, D";
 // change the order of accent characters
 String addOn = "& \u0300 ; \u0308 ; \u0302";
 RuleBasedCollator myCollator = new RuleBasedCollator(oldRules + addOn);

ParseException
RuleBasedCollator constructor.  This takes the table rules and builds
 a collation table out of them.  Please see RuleBasedCollator class
 description for more details on the collation rule syntax.
Parameters:
rules
- the collation rules to build the collation table from.
Throws:
ParseException
- A format exception
 will be thrown if the build process of the rules fails. For
 example, build rule "a < ? < d" will cause the constructor to
 throw the ParseException because the '?' is not quoted.
