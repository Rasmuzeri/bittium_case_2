Class EdECPoint
java.lang.Object
java.security.spec.EdECPoint
public final class
EdECPoint
extends
Object
An elliptic curve point used to specify keys as defined by
RFC 8032: Edwards-Curve
 Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)
. These points are distinct from the
 points represented by
ECPoint
, and they are intended for use with
 algorithms based on RFC 8032 such as the EdDSA
Signature
algorithm.
An EdEC point is specified by its y-coordinate value and a boolean that
 indicates whether the x-coordinate is odd. The y-coordinate is an
 element of the field of integers modulo some value p that is determined by
 the algorithm parameters. This field element is represented by a
BigInteger
, and implementations that consume objects of this class
 may reject integer values which are not in the range [0, p).
