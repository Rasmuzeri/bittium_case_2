java.security.spec
Provides classes and interfaces for key specifications and algorithm
 parameter specifications.
A key specification is a transparent representation of the key material
 that constitutes a key. A key may be specified in an algorithm-specific
 way, or in an algorithm-independent encoding format (such as ASN.1).
 This package contains key specifications for DSA public and private keys,
 RSA public and private keys, PKCS #8 private keys in DER-encoded format,
 and X.509 public and private keys in DER-encoded format.
An algorithm parameter specification is a transparent representation
 of the sets of parameters used with an algorithm. This package contains
 an algorithm parameter specification for parameters used with the
 DSA algorithm.
