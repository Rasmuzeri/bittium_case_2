Class KeyStore.Builder
java.lang.Object
java.security.KeyStore.Builder
Enclosing class:
KeyStore
public abstract static class
KeyStore.Builder
extends
Object
A description of a to-be-instantiated
KeyStore
object.
An instance of this class encapsulates the information needed to
 instantiate and initialize a
KeyStore
object. That process is
 triggered when the
getKeyStore()
method is called.
This makes it possible to decouple configuration from
KeyStore
object creation and e.g. delay a password prompt until it is
 needed.
Since:
1.5

getKeyStore
()
                              throws
KeyStoreException
Returns the
KeyStore
described by this object.
Returns:
the
KeyStore
described by this object
Throws:
KeyStoreException
- if an error occurred during the
   operation, for example if the
KeyStore
could not be
   instantiated or loaded
getProtectionParameter
public abstract
KeyStore.ProtectionParameter
getProtectionParameter
(
String
alias)
throws
KeyStoreException
Returns the
ProtectionParameter
that should be used to obtain
 the
Entry
with the given alias.
 The
getKeyStore
method must be invoked before this
 method may be called.
Parameters:
alias
- the alias of the
KeyStore
entry
Returns:
the
ProtectionParameter
that should be used to obtain
   the
Entry
with the given alias.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if alias is
null
KeyStoreException
- if an error occurred during the
   operation
IllegalStateException
- if the
getKeyStore
method has
   not been invoked prior to calling this method
newInstance
public static
KeyStore.Builder
newInstance
(
KeyStore
keyStore,
KeyStore.ProtectionParameter
protectionParameter)
Returns a new
Builder
that encapsulates the given
KeyStore
.
 The
getKeyStore()
method of the returned object
 will return
keyStore
, the
getProtectionParameter()
method will
 return
protectionParameters
.
This is useful if an existing
KeyStore
object needs to be
 used with builder-based APIs.
Parameters:
keyStore
- the
KeyStore
to be encapsulated
protectionParameter
- the
ProtectionParameter
used to
   protect the
KeyStore
entries
Returns:
a new
Builder
object
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
keyStore
or
protectionParameter
is
null
IllegalArgumentException
- if the
keyStore
has not been
   initialized
newInstance
public static
KeyStore.Builder
newInstance
(
String
type,
Provider
provider,
File
file,
KeyStore.ProtectionParameter
protection)
Returns a new
Builder
object.
The first call to the
getKeyStore()
method on the returned
 builder will create a
KeyStore
of type
type
and call
 its
load()
method.
 The
inputStream
argument is constructed from
file
.
 If
protection
is a
PasswordProtection
, the password is obtained by
 calling the
getPassword
method.
 Otherwise, if
protection
is a
CallbackHandlerProtection
, the password is obtained
 by invoking the CallbackHandler.
Subsequent calls to
getKeyStore()
return the same object
 as the initial call. If the initial call failed with a
KeyStoreException
, subsequent calls also throw a
KeyStoreException
.
The
KeyStore
is instantiated from
provider
if
 non-null. Otherwise, all installed providers are searched.
Calls to
getProtectionParameter()
will return a
PasswordProtection
object encapsulating the password that was used to invoke the
load
method.
Note
that the
getKeyStore()
method is executed
 within the
AccessControlContext
of the code invoking this
 method.
Parameters:
type
- the type of
KeyStore
to be constructed
provider
- the provider from which the
KeyStore
is to
   be instantiated (or
null
)
file
- the File that contains the
KeyStore
data
protection
- the
ProtectionParameter
securing the
KeyStore
data
Returns:
a new
Builder
object
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if type, file or protection is
null
IllegalArgumentException
- if protection is not an instance
   of either PasswordProtection or CallbackHandlerProtection; or
   if file does not exist or does not refer to a normal file
newInstance
public static
KeyStore.Builder
newInstance
(
File
file,
KeyStore.ProtectionParameter
protection)
Returns a new
Builder
object.
The first call to the
getKeyStore()
method on the returned
 builder will create a
KeyStore
using
file
to detect
 the keystore type and then call its
load()
method.
 It uses the same algorithm to determine the keystore type as
 described in
KeyStore.getInstance(File, LoadStoreParameter)
.
 The
inputStream
argument is constructed from
file
.
 If
protection
is a
PasswordProtection
, the password
 is obtained by calling the
getPassword
method.
 Otherwise, if
protection
is a
CallbackHandlerProtection
,
 the password is obtained by invoking the CallbackHandler.
Subsequent calls to
getKeyStore()
return the same object
 as the initial call. If the initial call failed with a
KeyStoreException
, subsequent calls also throw a
KeyStoreException
.
Calls to
getProtectionParameter()
will return a
PasswordProtection
object encapsulating the password that was used to invoke the
load
method.
Note
that the
getKeyStore()
method is executed
 within the
AccessControlContext
of the code invoking this
 method.
Parameters:
file
- the File that contains the
KeyStore
data
protection
- the
ProtectionParameter
securing the
KeyStore
data
Returns:
a new
Builder
object
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if file or protection is
null
IllegalArgumentException
- if protection is not an instance
   of either PasswordProtection or CallbackHandlerProtection; or
   if file does not exist or does not refer to a normal file

newInstance
public static
KeyStore.Builder
newInstance
(
String
type,
Provider
provider,
KeyStore.ProtectionParameter
protection)
Returns a new
Builder
object.
Each call to the
getKeyStore()
method on the returned
 builder will return a new
KeyStore
object of type
type
.
 Its
load()
method is invoked using a
LoadStoreParameter
that encapsulates
protection
.
The
KeyStore
is instantiated from
provider
if
 non-null. Otherwise, all installed providers are searched.
Calls to
getProtectionParameter()
will return
protection
.
Note
that the
getKeyStore()
method is executed
 within the
AccessControlContext
of the code invoking this
 method.

KeyStore
to be constructed
provider
