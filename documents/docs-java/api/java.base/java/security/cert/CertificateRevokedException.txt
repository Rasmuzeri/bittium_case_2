Method Details
getRevocationDate
public
Date
getRevocationDate
()
Returns the date on which the certificate was revoked. A new copy is
 returned each time the method is invoked to protect against subsequent
 modification.
Returns:
the revocation date
getRevocationReason
public
CRLReason
getRevocationReason
()
Returns the reason the certificate was revoked.
Returns:
the revocation reason
getAuthorityName
public
X500Principal
getAuthorityName
()
Returns the name of the authority that signed the certificate's
 revocation status information.
Returns:
the
X500Principal

     authority that signed the certificate's revocation status information
getInvalidityDate
public
Date
getInvalidityDate
()
Returns the invalidity date, as specified in the Invalidity Date
 extension of this
CertificateRevokedException
. The
 invalidity date is the date on which it is known or suspected that the
 private key was compromised or that the certificate otherwise became
 invalid. This implementation calls
getExtensions()
and
 checks the returned map for an entry for the Invalidity Date extension
 OID ("2.5.29.24"). If found, it returns the invalidity date in the
 extension; otherwise null. A new Date object is returned each time the
 method is invoked to protect against subsequent modification.
Returns:
the invalidity date, or
null
if not specified
getExtensions
public
Map
<
String
,
Extension
>
getExtensions
()
Returns a map of X.509 extensions containing additional information
 about the revoked certificate, such as the Invalidity Date
 Extension. Each key is an OID String that maps to the corresponding
 Extension.
Returns:
an unmodifiable map of X.509 extensions, or an empty map
    if there are no extensions
