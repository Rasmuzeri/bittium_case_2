PKIXCertPathChecker
,
PKIXRevocationChecker
public interface
CertPathChecker
Performs one or more checks on each
Certificate
of a
CertPath
.
A
CertPathChecker
implementation is typically created to extend
 a certification path validation algorithm. For example, an implementation
 may check for and process a critical private extension of each certificate
 in a certification path.

Description
void
check
(
Certificate

Performs the check(s) on the specified certificate using its internal
 state.
void
init
(boolean forward)

CertPathChecker
.
boolean

()
Indicates if forward checking is supported.
Method Details
init
void
init
(boolean forward)
throws
CertPathValidatorException
Initializes the internal state of this
CertPathChecker
.
The
forward
flag specifies the order that certificates will
 be passed to the
check
method (forward or reverse).
Parameters:
forward
- the order that certificates are presented to the
check
method. If
true
, certificates are
        presented from target to trust anchor (forward); if
false
, from trust anchor to target (reverse).
Throws:
CertPathValidatorException
- if this
CertPathChecker
is
         unable to check certificates in the specified order
isForwardCheckingSupported
boolean
isForwardCheckingSupported
()
Indicates if forward checking is supported. Forward checking refers
 to the ability of the
CertPathChecker
to perform its checks
 when certificates are presented to the
check
method in the
 forward direction (from target to trust anchor).
Returns:
true
if forward checking is supported,
false
otherwise
check
void
