All Implemented Interfaces:
X509Extension
public abstract class
X509CRLEntry
extends
Object
implements
X509Extension
Abstract class for a revoked certificate in a CRL (Certificate
 Revocation List).

 The ASN.1 definition for
revokedCertificates
is:
revokedCertificates    SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE  {
     userCertificate    CertificateSerialNumber,
     revocationDate     ChoiceOfTime,
     crlEntryExtensions Extensions OPTIONAL
                        -- if present, must be v2
 }  OPTIONAL

 CertificateSerialNumber  ::=  INTEGER

 Extensions  ::=  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Extension

 Extension  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
     extnId        OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
     critical      BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
     extnValue     OCTET STRING
                   -- contains a DER encoding of a value
                   -- of the type registered for use with
                   -- the extnId object identifier value
 }

Method Details
equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
other)
Compares this CRL entry for equality with the given
 object. If the
other
object is an
instanceof
X509CRLEntry
, then
 its encoded form (the inner SEQUENCE) is retrieved and compared
 with the encoded form of this CRL entry.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
other
- the object to test for equality with this CRL entry.
Returns:
true iff the encoded forms of the two CRL entries
 match, false otherwise.

Object.hashCode()
HashMap
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Returns a hashcode value for this CRL entry from its
 encoded form.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
the hashcode value.

Object.equals(java.lang.Object)
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)
getEncoded
public abstract
byte[]
getEncoded
()
                           throws
CRLException
Returns the ASN.1 DER-encoded form of this CRL Entry,
 that is the inner SEQUENCE.
Returns:
the encoded form of this certificate
Throws:
CRLException
- if an encoding error occurs.
getSerialNumber
public abstract
BigInteger
getSerialNumber
()
Gets the serial number from this X509CRLEntry,
 the
userCertificate
.
Returns:
the serial number.
getCertificateIssuer
public
X500Principal
getCertificateIssuer
()
Get the issuer of the X509Certificate described by this entry. If
 the certificate issuer is also the CRL issuer, this method returns
 null.
This method is used with indirect CRLs. The default implementation
 always returns null. Subclasses that wish to support indirect CRLs
 should override it.
Returns:
the issuer of the X509Certificate described by this entry
 or null if it is issued by the CRL issuer.
Since:
1.5
getRevocationDate
public abstract
Date
getRevocationDate
()
Gets the revocation date from this X509CRLEntry,
 the
revocationDate
.
Returns:
the revocation date.
hasExtensions
public abstract
boolean
hasExtensions
()
Returns true if this CRL entry has extensions.
Returns:
true if this entry has extensions, false otherwise.
toString
public abstract
String
toString
()
Returns a string representation of this CRL entry.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
a string representation of this CRL entry.
getRevocationReason
public
CRLReason
getRevocationReason
()
Returns the reason the certificate has been revoked, as specified
 in the Reason Code extension of this CRL entry.
Returns:
the reason the certificate has been revoked, or
null
if this CRL entry does not have
    a Reason Code extension
