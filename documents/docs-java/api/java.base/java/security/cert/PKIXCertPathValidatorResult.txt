Class PKIXCertPathValidatorResult
java.lang.Object
java.security.cert.PKIXCertPathValidatorResult
All Implemented Interfaces:
Cloneable
,
CertPathValidatorResult
Direct Known Subclasses:
PKIXCertPathBuilderResult
public class
PKIXCertPathValidatorResult
extends
Object
implements
CertPathValidatorResult
This class represents the successful result of the PKIX certification
 path validation algorithm.
Instances of
PKIXCertPathValidatorResult
are returned by the
validate
method of
CertPathValidator
objects implementing the PKIX algorithm.
All
PKIXCertPathValidatorResult
objects contain the
 valid policy tree and subject public key resulting from the
 validation algorithm, as well as a
TrustAnchor
describing
 the certification authority (CA) that served as a trust anchor for the
 certification path.
Concurrent Access
Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not
 thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
 object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
 provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
 separate objects need not synchronize.

Constructor Details

public
PKIXCertPathValidatorResult
(
TrustAnchor
trustAnchor,
PolicyNode
policyTree,
PublicKey
subjectPublicKey)
Creates an instance of
PKIXCertPathValidatorResult
containing the specified parameters.
Parameters:
trustAnchor
- a
TrustAnchor
describing the CA that
 served as a trust anchor for the certification path
policyTree
- the immutable valid policy tree, or
null
if there are no valid policies
subjectPublicKey
- the public key of the subject
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if the
subjectPublicKey
or
trustAnchor
parameters are
null
Method Details
getTrustAnchor
public
TrustAnchor
getTrustAnchor
()
Returns the
TrustAnchor
describing the CA that served
 as a trust anchor for the certification path.
Returns:
the
TrustAnchor
(never
null
)
getPolicyTree
public
PolicyNode
getPolicyTree
()
Returns the root node of the valid policy tree resulting from the
 PKIX certification path validation algorithm. The
PolicyNode
object that is returned and any objects that
 it returns through public methods are immutable.
Most applications will not need to examine the valid policy tree.
 They can achieve their policy processing goals by setting the
 policy-related parameters in
PKIXParameters
. However, more
 sophisticated applications, especially those that process policy
 qualifiers, may need to traverse the valid policy tree using the
PolicyNode.getParent
and
PolicyNode.getChildren
methods.
Returns:
the root node of the valid policy tree, or
null
if there are no valid policies
getPublicKey
public
PublicKey
getPublicKey
()
Returns the public key of the subject (target) of the certification
 path, including any inherited public key parameters if applicable.
Returns:
the public key of the subject (never
null
)
