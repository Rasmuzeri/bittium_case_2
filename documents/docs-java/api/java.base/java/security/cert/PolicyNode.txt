PolicyNode
An immutable valid policy tree node as defined by the PKIX certification
 path validation algorithm.
One of the outputs of the PKIX certification path validation
 algorithm is a valid policy tree, which includes the policies that
 were determined to be valid, how this determination was reached,
 and any policy qualifiers encountered. This tree is of depth
n
, where
n
is the length of the certification
 path that has been validated.
Most applications will not need to examine the valid policy tree.
 They can achieve their policy processing goals by setting the
 policy-related parameters in
PKIXParameters
. However,
 the valid policy tree is available for more sophisticated applications,
 especially those that process policy qualifiers.
PKIXCertPathValidatorResult.getPolicyTree
returns the root node of the
 valid policy tree. The tree can be traversed using the
getChildren
and
getParent
methods.
 Data about a particular node can be retrieved using other methods of
PolicyNode
.
Concurrent Access
All
PolicyNode
objects must be immutable and
 thread-safe. Multiple threads may concurrently invoke the methods defined
 in this class on a single
PolicyNode
object (or more than one)
 with no ill effects. This stipulation applies to all public fields and
 methods of this class and any added or overridden by subclasses.

Description
Iterator
<? extends
PolicyNode

()
Returns an iterator over the children of this node.
int
getDepth
()
Returns the depth of this node in the valid policy tree.
Set
<
String
>
getExpectedPolicies
()
Returns the set of expected policies that would satisfy this
 node's valid policy in the next certificate to be processed.
PolicyNode
getParent
()
Returns the parent of this node, or
null
if this is the
 root node.
Set
<? extends

Method Details
getParent
PolicyNode
getParent
()
Returns the parent of this node, or
null
if this is the
 root node.
Returns:
the parent of this node, or
null
if this is the
 root node
getChildren
Iterator
<? extends
PolicyNode
>
getChildren
()
Returns an iterator over the children of this node. Any attempts to
 modify the children of this node through the
Iterator
's remove method must throw an
UnsupportedOperationException
.
Returns:
an iterator over the children of this node
getDepth
int
getDepth
()
Returns the depth of this node in the valid policy tree.
Returns:
the depth of this node (0 for the root node, 1 for its
 children, and so on)
getValidPolicy
String
getValidPolicy
()
Returns the valid policy represented by this node.
Returns:
the
String
OID of the valid policy
 represented by this node. For the root node, this method always returns
 the special anyPolicy OID: "2.5.29.32.0".
getPolicyQualifiers
Set
<? extends
PolicyQualifierInfo
>
getPolicyQualifiers
()
Returns the set of policy qualifiers associated with the
 valid policy represented by this node.
Returns:
an immutable
Set
of
PolicyQualifierInfo
s. For the root node, this
 is always an empty
Set
.
getExpectedPolicies
Set
<
String
>
getExpectedPolicies
()
Returns the set of expected policies that would satisfy this
 node's valid policy in the next certificate to be processed.
Returns:
an immutable
Set
of expected policy
String
OIDs. For the root node, this method
 always returns a
Set
with one element, the
 special anyPolicy OID: "2.5.29.32.0".
isCritical
boolean
isCritical
()
Returns the criticality indicator of the certificate policy extension
 in the most recently processed certificate.
Returns:
true
if extension marked critical,
false
otherwise. For the root node,
false
is always returned.
