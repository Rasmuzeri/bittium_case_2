Interface CertSelector
All Superinterfaces:
Cloneable
All Known Implementing Classes:
X509CertSelector
public interface
CertSelector
extends
Cloneable
A selector that defines a set of criteria for selecting
Certificate
s. Classes that implement this interface
 are often used to specify which
Certificate
s should
 be retrieved from a
CertStore
.
Concurrent Access
Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this interface are not
 thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
 object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
 provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
 separate objects need not synchronize.
