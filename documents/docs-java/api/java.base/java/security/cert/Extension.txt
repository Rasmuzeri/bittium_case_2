Interface Extension
public interface
Extension
This interface represents an X.509 extension.
Extensions provide a means of associating additional attributes with users
 or public keys and for managing a certification hierarchy.  The extension
 format also allows communities to define private extensions to carry
 information unique to those communities.
Each extension contains an object identifier, a criticality setting
 indicating whether it is a critical or a non-critical extension, and
 an ASN.1 DER-encoded value. Its ASN.1 definition is:
Extension ::= SEQUENCE {
         extnId        OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
         critical      BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
         extnValue     OCTET STRING
                 -- contains a DER encoding of a value
                 -- of the type registered for use with
                 -- the extnId object identifier value
     }
This interface is designed to provide access to a single extension,
 unlike
X509Extension
which is more suitable
 for accessing a set of extensions.

Method Details
getId
String
getId
()
Gets the extensions's object identifier.
Returns:
the object identifier as a String
isCritical
boolean
isCritical
()
Gets the extension's criticality setting.
Returns:
true if this is a critical extension.
getValue
byte[]
getValue
()
Gets the extensions's DER-encoded value. Note, this is the bytes
 that are encoded as an OCTET STRING. It does not include the OCTET
 STRING tag and length.
Returns:
a copy of the extension's value, or
null
if no
    extension value is present.
encode
void
encode
(
OutputStream
out)
throws

Generates the extension's DER encoding and writes it to the output
 stream.
Parameters:
out
- the output stream
Throws:
IOException
- on encoding or output error.
NullPointerException
- if
out
is
