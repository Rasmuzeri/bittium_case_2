Interface CertPathBuilderResult
All Superinterfaces:
Cloneable
All Known Implementing Classes:
PKIXCertPathBuilderResult
public interface
CertPathBuilderResult
extends
Cloneable
A specification of the result of a certification path builder algorithm.
 All results returned by the
CertPathBuilder.build
method must implement this interface.
At a minimum, a
CertPathBuilderResult
contains the
CertPath
built by the
CertPathBuilder
instance.
 Implementations of this interface may add methods to return implementation
 or algorithm specific information, such as debugging information or
 certification path validation results.
Concurrent Access
Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this interface are not
 thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
 object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
 provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
 separate objects need not synchronize.
