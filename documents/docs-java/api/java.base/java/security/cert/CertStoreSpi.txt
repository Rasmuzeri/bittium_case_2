Class CertStoreSpi
java.lang.Object
java.security.cert.CertStoreSpi
public abstract class
CertStoreSpi
extends
Object
The
Service Provider Interface
(
SPI
)
 for the
CertStore
class. All
CertStore
implementations must include a class (the SPI class) that extends
 this class (
CertStoreSpi
), provides a constructor with
 a single argument of type
CertStoreParameters
, and implements
 all of its methods. In general, instances of this class should only be
 accessed through the
CertStore
class.
 For details, see the Java Cryptography Architecture.
Concurrent Access
The public methods of all
CertStoreSpi
objects must be
 thread-safe. That is, multiple threads may concurrently invoke these
 methods on a single
CertStoreSpi
object (or more than one)
 with no ill effects. This allows a
CertPathBuilder
to search
 for a CRL while simultaneously searching for further certificates, for
 instance.
Simple
CertStoreSpi
implementations will probably ensure
 thread safety by adding a
synchronized
keyword to their
engineGetCertificates
and
engineGetCRLs
methods.
 More sophisticated ones may allow truly concurrent access.

Method Details
engineGetCertificates
public abstract
Collection
<? extends
Certificate
>
engineGetCertificates
(
CertSelector
selector)
throws
CertStoreException
Returns a
Collection
of
Certificate
s that
 match the specified selector. If no
Certificate
s
 match the selector, an empty
Collection
will be returned.
For some
CertStore
types, the resulting
Collection
may not contain
all
of the
Certificate
s that match the selector. For instance,
 an LDAP
CertStore
may not search all entries in the
 directory. Instead, it may just search entries that are likely to
 contain the
Certificate
s it is looking for.
Some
CertStore
implementations (especially LDAP
CertStore
s) may throw a
CertStoreException
unless a non-null
CertSelector
is provided that includes
 specific criteria that can be used to find the certificates. Issuer
 and/or subject names are especially useful criteria.
Parameters:
selector
- A
CertSelector
used to select which
Certificate
s should be returned. Specify
null
to return all
Certificate
s (if supported).
Returns:
A
Collection
of
Certificate
s that
         match the specified selector (never
null
)
Throws:
CertStoreException
- if an exception occurs
engineGetCRLs
public abstract
Collection
<? extends
CRL
>
engineGetCRLs
(
CRLSelector
selector)
throws
CertStoreException
Returns a
Collection
of
CRL
s that
 match the specified selector. If no
CRL
s
 match the selector, an empty
Collection
will be returned.
For some
CertStore
types, the resulting
Collection
may not contain
all
of the
CRL
s that match the selector. For instance,
 an LDAP
CertStore
may not search all entries in the
 directory. Instead, it may just search entries that are likely to
 contain the
CRL
s it is looking for.
Some
CertStore
implementations (especially LDAP
CertStore
s) may throw a
CertStoreException
unless a non-null
CRLSelector
is provided that includes
 specific criteria that can be used to find the CRLs. Issuer names
 and/or the certificate to be checked are especially useful.
Parameters:
selector
- A
CRLSelector
used to select which
CRL
s should be returned. Specify
null
to return all
CRL
s (if supported).
Returns:
A
Collection
of
CRL
s that
         match the specified selector (never
null
)
Throws:
CertStoreException
- if an exception occurs
