Class PKIXCertPathBuilderResult

java.security.cert.PKIXCertPathValidatorResult

All Implemented Interfaces:

,

,
CertPathValidatorResult
public class
PKIXCertPathBuilderResult
extends
PKIXCertPathValidatorResult
implements
CertPathBuilderResult
This class represents the successful result of the PKIX certification
 path builder algorithm. All certification paths that are built and
 returned using this algorithm are also validated according to the PKIX
 certification path validation algorithm.
Instances of
PKIXCertPathBuilderResult
are returned by
 the
build
method of
CertPathBuilder
objects implementing the PKIX algorithm.
All
PKIXCertPathBuilderResult
objects contain the
 certification path constructed by the build algorithm, the
 valid policy tree and subject public key resulting from the build
 algorithm, and a
TrustAnchor
describing the certification
 authority (CA) that served as a trust anchor for the certification path.
Concurrent Access
Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not
 thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
 object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
 provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
 separate objects need not synchronize.

trustAnchor
- a
TrustAnchor
describing the CA that
 served as a trust anchor for the certification path

parameters
 are
null
Method Details
getCertPath
public
CertPath
getCertPath
()
Returns the built and validated certification path. The
CertPath
object does not include the trust anchor.
 Instead, use the
getTrustAnchor()
method to
 obtain the
TrustAnchor
that served as the trust anchor
 for the certification path.
Specified by:

in interface
CertPathBuilderResult
Returns:
the built and validated
CertPath
(never
null
