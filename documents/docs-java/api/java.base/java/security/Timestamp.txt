Method Details
getTimestamp
public
Date
getTimestamp
()
Returns the date and time when the
Timestamp
was generated.
Returns:
The timestamp's date and time.
getSignerCertPath
public
CertPath
getSignerCertPath
()
Returns the certificate path for the Timestamping Authority.
Returns:
The TSA's certificate path.
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Returns the hash code value for this
Timestamp
.
 The hash code is generated using the date and time of the

Timestamp
. Two timestamps are considered equal if the date and
 time of their timestamp's and their signer's certificate paths are equal.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- the object to test for equality with this
Timestamp
.
Returns:
true
if the timestamps are considered equal,
false
otherwise.
