public class
AccessControlException
extends
SecurityException
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
This class is only useful in conjunction with
the Security Manager
, which is deprecated
       and subject to removal in a future release. Consequently, this class
       is also deprecated and subject to removal. There is no replacement for
       the Security Manager or this class.
This exception is thrown by the
AccessController
to indicate
 that a requested access (to a critical system resource such as the
 file system or the network) is denied.
The reason to deny access can vary.  For example, the requested
 permission might be of an incorrect type, contain an invalid
 value, or request access that is not allowed according to the
 security policy.  Such information should be given whenever
 possible at the time the exception is thrown.
