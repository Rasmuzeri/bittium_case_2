public class
DigestInputStream
extends
FilterInputStream
A transparent stream that updates the associated message digest using
 the bits going through the stream.
To complete the message digest computation, call one of the
digest
methods on the associated message
 digest after your calls to one of this digest input stream's
read
methods.
It is possible to turn this stream on or off (see
on
). When it is on, a call to one of the
read
methods
 results in an update on the message digest.  But when it is off,
 the message digest is not updated. The default is for the stream
 to be on.
Note that digest objects can compute only one digest (see
MessageDigest
),
 so that in order to compute intermediate digests, a caller should
 retain a handle onto the digest object, and clone it for each
 digest to be computed, leaving the original digest untouched.
Implementation Note:
This implementation only updates the message digest
      with data actually read from the input stream when it is
turned on
. This includes the various
read
methods,
transferTo
,
readAllBytes
,
      and
readNBytes
. Please note that data bypassed by the
skip
method are ignored. On the other hand,
      if the underlying stream supports the
mark
and
reset
methods, and the same data is read again after
reset
, then the message digest is updated again.
Since:
1.2

MessageDigest
digest
The message digest associated with this stream.
Constructor Details
DigestInputStream
public
DigestInputStream
(
InputStream
stream,
MessageDigest
digest)
Creates a digest input stream, using the specified input stream
 and message digest.
Parameters:
stream
- the input stream.
digest
- the message digest to associate with this stream.
Method Details
getMessageDigest
public
MessageDigest
getMessageDigest
()
Returns the message digest associated with this stream.
Returns:
the message digest associated with this stream.
See Also:
setMessageDigest(java.security.MessageDigest)
setMessageDigest
public
void
setMessageDigest
(
MessageDigest
digest)
Associates the specified message digest with this stream.
Parameters:
digest
- the message digest to be associated with this stream.
See Also:
getMessageDigest()
read
public
int
read
()
         throws
IOException
Reads a byte, and updates the message digest (if the digest
 function is on).  That is, this method reads a byte from the
 input stream, blocking until the byte is actually read. If the
 digest function is on (see
on
), this method
 will then call
update
on the message digest associated
 with this stream, passing it the byte read.
Overrides:
read
in class
FilterInputStream
Returns:
the byte read.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
See Also:
MessageDigest.update(byte)
read
public
int
read
(byte[] b,
 int off,
 int len)
throws
IOException
Reads into a byte array, and updates the message digest (if the
 digest function is on).  That is, this method reads up to
len
bytes from the input stream into the array
b
, starting at offset
off
. This method
 blocks until the data is actually
 read. If the digest function is on (see
on
), this method will then call
update
on the message digest associated with this stream, passing it
 the data.
Overrides:
read
in class
FilterInputStream
Parameters:
b
- the array into which the data is read.
off
- the starting offset into
b
of where the
 data should be placed.
len
- the maximum number of bytes to be read from the input
 stream into b, starting at offset
off
.
Returns:
the actual number of bytes read. This is less than
len
if the end of the stream is reached prior to
 reading
len
bytes. -1 is returned if no bytes were
 read because the end of the stream had already been reached when
 the call was made.
Throws:
IOException
- if an I/O error occurs.
See Also:
MessageDigest.update(byte[], int, int)
on
public
void
on
(boolean on)
Turns the digest function on or off. The default is on.  When
 it is on, a call to one of the
read
methods results in an
 update on the message digest.  But when it is off, the message
 digest is not updated.
Parameters:
on
-
true
to turn the digest function on,
false
to turn it off.
toString
public
String
toString
()
Prints a string representation of this digest input stream and
 its associated message digest object.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
a string representation of the object.
