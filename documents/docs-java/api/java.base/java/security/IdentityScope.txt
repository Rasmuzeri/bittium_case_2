IdentityScope
extends
Identity
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
This class is deprecated and subject to removal in a future
     version of Java SE. It has been replaced by
java.security.KeyStore
, the
java.security.cert
package,
     and
java.security.Principal
.
This class represents a scope for identities. It is an Identity
 itself, and therefore has a name and can have a scope. It can also
 optionally have a public key and associated certificates.
An
IdentityScope
can contain
Identity
objects of all
 kinds, including signers. All types of
Identity
objects can be
 retrieved, added, and removed using the same methods. Note that it is
 possible, and in fact expected, that different types of identity scopes will
 apply different policies for their various operations on the
 various types of Identities.
There is a one-to-one mapping between keys and identities, and
 there can only be one copy of one key per scope. For example, suppose
Acme Software, Inc
is a software publisher known to a user.
 Suppose it is an Identity, that is, it has a public key, and a set of
 associated certificates. It is named in the scope using the name
 "Acme Software". No other named Identity in the scope has the same
 public  key. Of course, none has the same name as well.

getSystemScope
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Returns the system's identity scope.
Returns:

scope)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Sets the system's identity scope.
First, if there is a security manager, its
checkSecurityAccess
method is called with
"setSystemScope"
as its argument to see if it's ok to set the identity scope.
Parameters:
scope
- the scope to set.
Throws:
SecurityException
- if a security manager exists and its
checkSecurityAccess
method doesn't allow
 setting the identity scope.
