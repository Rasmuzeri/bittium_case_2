[] chain)
Constructs a
PrivateKeyEntry
with a
PrivateKey
and corresponding certificate chain.
The specified
chain
is cloned before it is stored
 in the new
PrivateKeyEntry
object.
Parameters:
privateKey
- the
PrivateKey
chain
- an array of
Certificate
s
      representing the certificate chain.
      The chain must be ordered and contain a

at index 0
      corresponding to the private key.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
privateKey
or
chain
is
null
IllegalArgumentException
- if the specified chain has a
      length of 0, if the specified chain does not contain
Certificate
s of the same type,
      or if the
