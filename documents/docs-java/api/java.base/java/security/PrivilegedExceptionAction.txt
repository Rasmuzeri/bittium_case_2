Interface PrivilegedExceptionAction<T>
Type Parameters:
T
- the type of the result of running the computation
Functional Interface:
This is a functional interface and can therefore be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.
@FunctionalInterface
public interface
PrivilegedExceptionAction<T>
A computation to be performed with privileges enabled, that throws one or
 more checked exceptions.  The computation is performed by invoking
AccessController.doPrivileged
on the
PrivilegedExceptionAction
object.  This interface is
 used only for computations that throw checked exceptions;
 computations that do not throw
 checked exceptions should use
PrivilegedAction
instead.
Since:
1.2

Exception
Performs the computation.  This method will be called by
AccessController.doPrivileged
after enabling privileges.
Returns:
a class-dependent value that may represent the results of the
         computation.  Each class that implements
PrivilegedExceptionAction
should document what
         (if anything) this value represents.
Throws:
Exception
- an exceptional condition has occurred.  Each class
         that implements
PrivilegedExceptionAction
should
         document the exceptions that its run method can throw.
