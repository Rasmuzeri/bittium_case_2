Constructor Details
CodeSigner
public
CodeSigner
(
CertPath
signerCertPath,
Timestamp
timestamp)
Constructs a
CodeSigner
object.
Parameters:
signerCertPath
- The signer's certificate path.
                       It must not be
null
.
timestamp
- A signature timestamp.
                  If
null
then no timestamp was generated
                  for the signature.
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
signerCertPath
is
null
.
Method Details
getSignerCertPath
public
CertPath
getSignerCertPath
()
Returns the signer's certificate path.
Returns:
A certificate path.
getTimestamp
public
Timestamp
getTimestamp
()
Returns the signature timestamp.
Returns:
The timestamp or
null
if none is present.
hashCode
public
int
hashCode
()
Returns the hash code value for this code signer.
 The hash code is generated using the signer's certificate path and the
 timestamp, if present.
Overrides:
hashCode
in class
Object
Returns:
a hash code value for this code signer.

equals
public
boolean
equals
(
Object
obj)
Tests for equality between the specified object and this
 code signer. Two code signers are considered equal if their
 signer certificate paths are equal and if their timestamps are equal,
 if present in both.
Overrides:
equals
in class
Object
Parameters:
obj
- the object to test for equality with this object.
Returns:
true
if the objects are considered equal,
false
otherwise.

toString
public
String
toString
()
Returns a string describing this code signer.
Overrides:
toString
in class
Object
Returns:
A string comprising the signer's certificate and a timestamp,
         if present.
