Class PolicySpi

java.security.PolicySpi
@Deprecated
(
since
="17",
forRemoval
=true)
public abstract class
PolicySpi
extends
Object
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
This class is only useful in conjunction with
the Security Manager
, which is deprecated
       and subject to removal in a future release. Consequently, this class
       is also deprecated and subject to removal. There is no replacement for
       the Security Manager or this class.
This class defines the
Service Provider Interface
(
SPI
)
 for the
Policy
class.
 All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
 service provider who wishes to supply a
Policy
implementation.
Subclass implementations of this abstract class must provide
 a public constructor that takes a
Policy.Parameters
object as an input parameter.  This constructor also must throw
 an
IllegalArgumentException
if it does not understand the
Policy.Parameters
input.
Since:
1.6

permission)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Check whether the policy has granted a Permission to a ProtectionDomain.
Parameters:
domain
- the ProtectionDomain to check.
permission
- check whether this permission is granted to the
          specified domain.
Returns:
boolean
true
if the permission is granted to the domain.
engineRefresh
protected
void
engineRefresh
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Refreshes/reloads the policy configuration. The behavior of this method
 depends on the implementation. For example, calling
refresh
on a file-based policy will cause the file to be re-read.
The default implementation of this method does nothing.
 This method should be overridden if a refresh operation is supported
 by the policy implementation.
engineGetPermissions
protected
PermissionCollection
engineGetPermissions
(
CodeSource
codesource)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Return a PermissionCollection object containing the set of
 permissions granted to the specified CodeSource.
The default implementation of this method returns
 Policy.UNSUPPORTED_EMPTY_COLLECTION object.  This method can be
 overridden if the policy implementation can return a set of
 permissions granted to a CodeSource.
Parameters:
codesource
- the CodeSource to which the returned
          PermissionCollection has been granted.
Returns:
a set of permissions granted to the specified CodeSource.
          If this operation is supported, the returned
          set of permissions must be a new mutable instance
          and it must support heterogeneous Permission types.
          If this operation is not supported,
          Policy.UNSUPPORTED_EMPTY_COLLECTION is returned.

(

domain)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Return a PermissionCollection object containing the set of
 permissions granted to the specified ProtectionDomain.
The default implementation of this method returns
 Policy.UNSUPPORTED_EMPTY_COLLECTION object.  This method can be
 overridden if the policy implementation can return a set of
 permissions granted to a ProtectionDomain.
Parameters:
domain
- the ProtectionDomain to which the returned
          PermissionCollection has been granted.
Returns:
a set of permissions granted to the specified ProtectionDomain.
          If this operation is supported, the returned
          set of permissions must be a new mutable instance
          and it must support heterogeneous Permission types.
          If this operation is not supported,
          Policy.UNSUPPORTED_EMPTY_COLLECTION is returned.
