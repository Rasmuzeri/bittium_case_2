Class GuardedObject
java.lang.Object
java.security.GuardedObject
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
GuardedObject
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
A GuardedObject is an object that is used to protect access to
 another object.
A GuardedObject encapsulates a target object and a Guard object,
 such that access to the target object is possible
 only if the Guard object allows it.
 Once an object is encapsulated by a GuardedObject,
 access to that object is controlled by the
getObject
method, which invokes the
checkGuard
method on the Guard object that is
 guarding access. If access is not allowed,
 an exception is thrown.
