java.security.KeyRep
All Implemented Interfaces:
Serializable
public class
KeyRep
extends
Object
implements
Serializable
Standardized representation for serialized Key objects.
Note that a serialized Key may contain sensitive information
 which should not be exposed in untrusted environments.  See the
Security Appendix
of the
Java Object Serialization Specification
for more information.

1.5

Resolve the Key object.
This method supports three Type/format combinations:
Type.SECRET/"RAW" - returns a SecretKeySpec object
 constructed using encoded key bytes and algorithm
Type.PUBLIC/"X.509" - gets a KeyFactory instance for
 the key algorithm, constructs an X509EncodedKeySpec with the
 encoded key bytes, and generates a public key from the spec
Type.PRIVATE/"PKCS#8" - gets a KeyFactory instance for
 the key algorithm, constructs a PKCS8EncodedKeySpec with the
 encoded key bytes, and generates a private key from the spec
Returns:
the resolved Key object
Throws:
ObjectStreamException
- if the Type/format
  combination is unrecognized, if the algorithm, key format, or
  encoded key bytes are unrecognized/invalid, of if the
  resolution of the key fails for any reason
