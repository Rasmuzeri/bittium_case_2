public interface
PrivateKey
extends
Key
,
Destroyable
A private key.
 The purpose of this interface is to group (and provide type safety
 for) all private key interfaces.
Note: The specialized private key interfaces extend this interface.
 See, for example, the
DSAPrivateKey
interface in
java.security.interfaces
.
Implementations should override the default
destroy
and
isDestroyed
methods from the
Destroyable
interface to enable
 sensitive key information to be destroyed, cleared, or in the case
 where such information is immutable, unreferenced.
 Finally, since
PrivateKey
is
Serializable
, implementations
 should also override
ObjectOutputStream.writeObject(java.lang.Object)
to prevent keys that have been destroyed from being serialized.
