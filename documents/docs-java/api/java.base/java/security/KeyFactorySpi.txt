Class KeyFactorySpi
java.lang.Object
java.security.KeyFactorySpi
public abstract class
KeyFactorySpi
extends
Object
This class defines the
Service Provider Interface
(
SPI
)
 for the
KeyFactory
class.
 All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
 cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
 of a key factory for a particular algorithm.
Key factories are used to convert
keys
(opaque
 cryptographic keys of type
Key
) into
key specifications
(transparent representations of the underlying key material), and vice
 versa.
Key factories are bidirectional. That is, they allow you to build an
 opaque key object from a given key specification (key material), or to
 retrieve the underlying key material of a key object in a suitable format.
Multiple compatible key specifications may exist for the same key.
 For example, a DSA public key may be specified using
DSAPublicKeySpec
or
X509EncodedKeySpec
. A key factory can be used to translate
 between compatible key specifications.
A provider should document all the key specifications supported by its
 key factory.

engineGeneratePublic
protected abstract
PublicKey
engineGeneratePublic
(
KeySpec
keySpec)
throws
InvalidKeySpecException
Generates a public key object from the provided key
 specification (key material).
Parameters:
keySpec
- the specification (key material) of the public key.
Returns:
the public key.
Throws:
InvalidKeySpecException
- if the given key specification
 is inappropriate for this key factory to produce a public key.
engineGeneratePrivate
protected abstract
PrivateKey
engineGeneratePrivate
(
KeySpec
keySpec)
throws
InvalidKeySpecException
Generates a private key object from the provided key
 specification (key material).
Parameters:
keySpec
- the specification (key material) of the private key.
Returns:
the private key.
Throws:
InvalidKeySpecException
- if the given key specification
 is inappropriate for this key factory to produce a private key.
engineGetKeySpec
protected abstract
<T extends
KeySpec
>
T
engineGetKeySpec
(
Key
key,
Class
<T> keySpec)
throws
InvalidKeySpecException
Returns a specification (key material) of the given key
 object.
keySpec
identifies the specification class in which
 the key material should be returned. It could, for example, be
DSAPublicKeySpec.class
, to indicate that the
 key material should be returned in an instance of the
DSAPublicKeySpec
class.
Type Parameters:
T
- the type of the key specification to be returned
Parameters:
key
- the key.
keySpec
- the specification class in which
 the key material should be returned.
Returns:
the underlying key specification (key material) in an instance
 of the requested specification class.
Throws:
InvalidKeySpecException
- if the requested key specification is
 inappropriate for the given key, or the given key cannot be dealt with
 (e.g., the given key has an unrecognized format).
engineTranslateKey
protected abstract
Key
engineTranslateKey
(
Key
key)
throws
InvalidKeyException
Translates a key object, whose provider may be unknown or
 potentially untrusted, into a corresponding key object of this key
 factory.
Parameters:
key
- the key whose provider is unknown or untrusted.
Returns:
the translated key.
Throws:
InvalidKeyException
- if the given key cannot be processed
 by this key factory.
