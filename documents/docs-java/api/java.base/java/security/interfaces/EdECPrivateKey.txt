EdECPrivateKey
extends

PrivateKey
An interface for an elliptic curve private key as defined by
RFC 8032: Edwards-Curve
 Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)
. These keys are distinct from the
 keys represented by
ECPrivateKey
, and they are intended for use
 with algorithms based on RFC 8032 such as the EdDSA
Signature
algorithm.
An Edwards-Curve private key is a bit string. This interface only supports bit
 string lengths that are a multiple of 8, and the key is represented using
 a byte array.
