XECPublicKey
extends

,
PublicKey
An interface for an elliptic curve public key as defined by RFC 7748.
 These keys are distinct from the keys represented by
ECPublicKey
,
 and they are intended for use with algorithms based on RFC 7748 such as the
 XDH
KeyAgreement
algorithm.

 An XEC public key is a particular point on the curve, which is represented
 using only its u-coordinate as described in RFC 7748. A u-coordinate is an
 element of the field of integers modulo some value that is determined by
 the algorithm parameters. This field element is represented by a BigInteger
 which may hold any value. That is, the BigInteger is not restricted to the
 range of canonical field elements.
