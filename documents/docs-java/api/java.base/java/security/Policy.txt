public abstract class
Policy
extends
Object
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
This class is only useful in conjunction with
the Security Manager
, which is deprecated
       and subject to removal in a future release. Consequently, this class
       is also deprecated and subject to removal. There is no replacement for
       the Security Manager or this class.
A
Policy
object is responsible for determining whether code executing
 in the Java runtime environment has permission to perform a
 security-sensitive operation.
There is only one
Policy
object installed in the runtime at any
 given time.  A
Policy
object can be installed by calling the
setPolicy
method.  The installed
Policy
object can be
 obtained by calling the
getPolicy
method.
If no
Policy
object has been installed in the runtime, a call to
getPolicy
installs an instance of the default
Policy
implementation (a default subclass implementation of this abstract class).
 The default
Policy
implementation can be changed by setting the value
 of the
policy.provider
security property to the fully qualified
 name of the desired
Policy
subclass implementation. The system
 class loader is used to load this class.
Application code can directly subclass
Policy
to provide a custom
 implementation.  In addition, an instance of a
Policy
object can be
 constructed by invoking one of the
getInstance
factory methods
 with a standard type.  The default policy type is "JavaPolicy".
Once a
Policy
instance has been installed (either by default,
 or by calling
setPolicy
), the Java runtime invokes its
implies
method when it needs to
 determine whether executing code (encapsulated in a ProtectionDomain)
 can perform SecurityManager-protected operations.  How a
Policy
object retrieves its policy data is up to the
Policy
implementation
 itself. The policy data may be stored, for example, in a flat ASCII file,
 in a serialized binary file of the
Policy
class, or in a database.
The
refresh
method causes the policy object to
 refresh/reload its data.  This operation is implementation-dependent.
 For example, if the policy object stores its data in configuration files,
 calling
refresh
will cause it to re-read the configuration
 policy files.  If a refresh operation is not supported, this method does
 nothing.  Note that refreshed policy may not have an effect on classes
 in a particular ProtectionDomain. This is dependent on the policy
 provider's implementation of the
implies
method and its PermissionCollection caching strategy.

Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Returns a Policy object of the specified type.
This method traverses the list of registered security providers,
 starting with the most preferred provider.
 A new
Policy
object encapsulating the
PolicySpi
implementation from the first
 provider that supports the specified type is returned.
Note that the list of registered providers may be retrieved via
 the
Security.getProviders()
method.
Implementation Note:
The JDK Reference Implementation additionally uses the
jdk.security.provider.preferred
Security
property to determine
 the preferred provider order for the specified algorithm. This
 may be different than the order of providers returned by
Security.getProviders()
.
Parameters:

Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification
for a list of standard Policy types.

Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Return a PermissionCollection object containing the set of
 permissions granted to the specified CodeSource.
Applications are discouraged from calling this method
 since this operation may not be supported by all policy implementations.
 Applications should solely rely on the
implies
method
 to perform policy checks.  If an application absolutely must call
 a getPermissions method, it should call
getPermissions(ProtectionDomain)
.
The default implementation of this method returns
 Policy.UNSUPPORTED_EMPTY_COLLECTION.  This method can be
 overridden if the policy implementation can return a set of
 permissions granted to a CodeSource.
Parameters:
codesource
- the CodeSource to which the returned
          PermissionCollection has been granted.
Returns:
a set of permissions granted to the specified CodeSource.
          If this operation is supported, the returned
          set of permissions must be a new mutable instance
          and it must support heterogeneous Permission types.
          If this operation is not supported,
          Policy.UNSUPPORTED_EMPTY_COLLECTION is returned.

getPermissions

Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Return a PermissionCollection object containing the set of
 permissions granted to the specified ProtectionDomain.
Applications are discouraged from calling this method
 since this operation may not be supported by all policy implementations.
 Applications should rely on the
implies
method
 to perform policy checks.
The default implementation of this method first retrieves
 the permissions returned via
getPermissions(CodeSource)
(the CodeSource is taken from the specified ProtectionDomain),
 as well as the permissions located inside the specified ProtectionDomain.
 All of these permissions are then combined and returned in a new
 PermissionCollection object.  If
getPermissions(CodeSource)
returns Policy.UNSUPPORTED_EMPTY_COLLECTION, then this method
 returns the permissions contained inside the specified ProtectionDomain
 in a new PermissionCollection object.
This method can be overridden if the policy implementation
 supports returning a set of permissions granted to a ProtectionDomain.
Parameters:
domain
- the ProtectionDomain to which the returned
          PermissionCollection has been granted.
Returns:
a set of permissions granted to the specified ProtectionDomain.
          If this operation is supported, the returned
          set of permissions must be a new mutable instance
          and it must support heterogeneous Permission types.
          If this operation is not supported,
          Policy.UNSUPPORTED_EMPTY_COLLECTION is returned.

Refreshes/reloads the policy configuration. The behavior of this method
 depends on the implementation. For example, calling
refresh
on a file-based policy will cause the file to be re-read.
The default implementation of this method does nothing.
 This method should be overridden if a refresh operation is supported
 by the policy implementation.
