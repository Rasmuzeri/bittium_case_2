Interface PrivilegedAction<T>
Type Parameters:
T
- the type of the result of running the computation
Functional Interface:
This is a functional interface and can therefore be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.
@FunctionalInterface
public interface
PrivilegedAction<T>
A computation to be performed with privileges enabled.  The computation is
 performed by invoking
AccessController.doPrivileged
on the
PrivilegedAction
object.  This interface is used only for
 computations that do not throw checked exceptions; computations that
 throw checked exceptions must use
PrivilegedExceptionAction
instead.
Since:
1.2
