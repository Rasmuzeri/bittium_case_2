Module java.base
module
java.base
Defines the foundational APIs of the Java SE Platform.
Providers:
The JDK implementation of this module provides an implementation of
      the
jrt
file system provider
to enumerate and read the class and resource
      files in a run-time image.
      The jrt file system can be created by calling
FileSystems.getFileSystem(URI.create("jrt:/"))
.
