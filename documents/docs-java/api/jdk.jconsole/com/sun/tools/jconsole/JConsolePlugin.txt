Package
com.sun.tools.jconsole
Class JConsolePlugin
java.lang.Object
com.sun.tools.jconsole.JConsolePlugin
public abstract class
JConsolePlugin
extends
Object
A JConsole plugin class.  JConsole uses the
service provider
mechanism to search the JConsole plugins.
 Users can provide their JConsole plugins in a jar file
 containing a file named
META-INF/services/com.sun.tools.jconsole.JConsolePlugin
This file contains one line for each plugin, for example,
com.sun.example.JTop
which is the fully qualified class name of the class implementing
JConsolePlugin
.
To load the JConsole plugins in JConsole, run:
jconsole -pluginpath <plugin-path>
where
<plugin-path>
specifies the paths of JConsole
 plugins to look up which can be a directory or a jar file. Multiple
 paths are separated by the path separator character of the platform.
When a new JConsole window is created for a connection,
 an instance of each
JConsolePlugin
will be created.
 The
JConsoleContext
object is not available at its
 construction time.
 JConsole will set the
JConsoleContext
object for
 a plugin after the plugin object is created.  It will then
 call its
getTabs
method and add the returned
 tabs to the JConsole window.
Since:
1.6

Method Details
setContext
public final
void
setContext
(
JConsoleContext
context)
Sets the
JConsoleContext
object representing
 the connection to an application.  This method will be called
 only once after the plugin is created and before the
getTabs()
is called. The given
context
can be in any
connection state
when
 this method is called.
Parameters:
context
- a
JConsoleContext
object
getContext
public final
JConsoleContext
getContext
()
Returns the
JConsoleContext
object representing
 the connection to an application.  This method may return
null
if it is called before the
context
is initialized.
Returns:
the
JConsoleContext
object representing
         the connection to an application.
getTabs
public abstract
Map
<
String
,
JPanel
>
getTabs
()
Returns the tabs to be added in JConsole window.
The returned map contains one entry for each tab
 to be added in the tabbed pane in a JConsole window with
 the tab name as the key
 and the
JPanel
object as the value.
 This method returns an empty map if no tab is added by this plugin.
 This method will be called from the
Event Dispatch Thread
once at the new connection time.
Returns:
a map of a tab name and a
JPanel
object
         representing the tabs to be added in the JConsole window;
         or an empty map.
newSwingWorker
public abstract
SwingWorker
<?,
?>
newSwingWorker
()
Returns a
SwingWorker
to perform
 the GUI update for this plugin at the same interval
 as JConsole updates the GUI.
JConsole schedules the GUI update at an interval specified
 for a connection.  This method will be called at every
 update to obtain a
SwingWorker
for each plugin.
JConsole will invoke the
execute()
method to schedule the returned
SwingWorker
for execution
 if:
the
SwingWorker
object has not been executed
        (i.e. the
SwingWorker.getState()
method
        returns
PENDING
state); and
the
SwingWorker
object returned in the previous
        update has completed the task if it was not
null
(i.e. the
SwingWorker.isDone
method
        returns
true
).
Otherwise,
SwingWorker
object will not be scheduled to work.
A plugin can schedule its own GUI update and this method
 will return
null
.
Returns:
a
SwingWorker
to perform the GUI update; or
null
.
dispose
public
void
dispose
()
Dispose this plugin. This method is called by JConsole to inform
 that this plugin will be discarded and that it should free
 any resources that it has allocated.
 The
JConsoleContext
can be in any
connection state
when
 this method is called.
addContextPropertyChangeListener
public final
void
addContextPropertyChangeListener
(
PropertyChangeListener
listener)
Adds a
PropertyChangeListener
to the
JConsoleContext
object for this plugin.
 This method is a convenient method for this plugin to register
 a listener when the
JConsoleContext
object may or
 may not be available.
For example, a plugin constructor can
 call this method to register a listener to listen to the
connectionState
property changes and the listener will be added to the
JConsoleContext
object when it is available.
Parameters:
listener
- The
PropertyChangeListener
to be added
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
listener
is
null
.
removeContextPropertyChangeListener
public final
void
removeContextPropertyChangeListener
(
PropertyChangeListener
listener)
Removes a
PropertyChangeListener
from the listener list of the
JConsoleContext
object for this plugin.
 If
listener
was never added, no exception is
 thrown and no action is taken.
Parameters:
listener
- the
PropertyChangeListener
to be removed
Throws:
NullPointerException
- if
listener
is
null
.
