.
pid
The process ID for which the stack trace is printed. The process must be
a Java process. To get a list of Java processes running on a machine,
use either the
ps
command or, if the JVM processes are not
running in a separate docker instance, the
jps
command.
Description
The
jstack
command prints Java stack traces of Java
threads for a specified Java process. For each Java frame, the full
class name, method name, byte code index (BCI), and line number, when
available, are printed. C++ mangled names aren't demangled. To demangle
C++ names, the output of this command can be piped to
c++filt
. When the specified process is running on a 64-bit
JVM, you might need to specify the
-J-d64
option, for
example:
jstack -J-d64
pid
.
Note:
This command is unsupported and might not be available in future
releases of the JDK. In Windows Systems where the
dbgeng.dll
file isn't present, the Debugging Tools for
Windows must be installed so that these tools work. The
PATH
environment variable needs to contain the location of
the
jvm.dll
that is used by the target process, or the
location from which the core dump file was produced.
Options for the jstack
Command
