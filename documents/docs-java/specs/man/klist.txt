Description
The
klist
tool displays the entries in the local
credentials cache and key table. After you modify the credentials cache
with the
kinit
tool or modify the keytab with the
ktab
tool, the only way to verify the changes is to view
the contents of the credentials cache or keytab using the
klist
tool. The
klist
tool doesn't change the
Kerberos database.
Commands
-c
Specifies that the credential cache is to be listed.
The following are the options for credential cache entries:
-f
Show credential flags.
-e
Show the encryption type.
-a
Show addresses.
-n
If the
-a
option is specified, don't reverse resolve
addresses.
-k
Specifies that key tab is to be listed.
List the keytab entries. The following are the options for keytab
entries:
-t
Show keytab entry timestamps.
-K
Show keytab entry DES keys.
-e
Shows keytab entry key type.
name
Specifies the credential cache name or the keytab name. File-based cache
or keytab's prefix is
FILE:
. If the name isn't specified,
the
klist
tool uses default values for the cache name and
keytab. The
kinit
documentation lists these default values.
-help
Displays instructions.
Examples
List entries in the keytable specified including keytab entry
timestamps and DES keys:
klist -k -t -K FILE:\temp\mykrb5cc
List entries in the credentials cache specified including credentials
flag and address list:
klist -c -f FILE:\temp\mykrb5cc
