A remote object registry is a bootstrap naming service that's used by
RMI servers on the same host to bind remote objects to names. Clients on
local and remote hosts can then look up remote objects and make remote
method invocations.
The registry is typically used to locate the first remote object on
which an application needs to call methods. That object then provides
application-specific support for finding other objects.
The methods of the
java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry
class are used to get a registry operating on the local host or local
host and port.
The URL-based methods of the
java.rmi.Naming
class
operate on a registry and can be used to:
Bind the specified name to a remote object
Return an array of the names bound in the registry
Return a reference, a stub, for the remote object associated with
the specified name
Rebind the specified name to a new remote object
Destroy the binding for the specified name that's associated with
a remote object
