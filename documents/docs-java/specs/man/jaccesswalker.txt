Building the GUI Hierarchy
Examining a GUI Component
Name
jaccesswalker - navigate through the component trees in a particular
Java Virtual Machine and present the hierarchy in a tree view
Description
You select a node in the tree, and from the
Panels
menu, you select
Accessibility API Panel
. The
jaccesswalker
tool shows you the accessibility information
for the object in the window.
Running the jaccesswalker
Tool
To use
jaccesswalker
, launch the
jaccesswalker
tool after launching a Java application. For
example, to launch
jaccesswalker
, enter the following
command:
Note:
JAVA_HOME
is an environment variable and should be set
to the path of the JDK or JRE, such as,
c:\Program Files\Java\jdk-10
.
%JAVA_HOME%\bin\jaccesswalker.exe
You now have two windows open: The Java application window, and the
window for the
jaccesswalker
tool. There are two tasks that
you can do with
jaccesswalker
. You can build a tree view
of the Java applications' GUI hierarchy, and you can query the Java
Accessibility API information of a particular element in the GUI
hierarchy.
Building the GUI Hierarchy
From the
File
menu, select
Refresh
Tree
menu. The
jaccesswalker
tool builds a list of
the top-level windows belonging to Java applications. The tool then
recursively queries the elements in those windows, and builds a tree of
all of the GUI components in all of the Java applications in all of the
JVMs running in the system.
Examining a GUI Component
After a GUI tree is built, you can view detailed accessibility
information about an individual GUI component by selecting it in the
tree, then selecting
Panels
, and then
Display
Accessibility Information
.
