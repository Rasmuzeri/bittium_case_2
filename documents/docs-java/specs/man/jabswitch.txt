Description
The
jabswitch
command is a utility program that enables
the Java Access Bridge to be loaded by the JDK on Windows platforms. The
Java Access Bridge is used by Assistive Technologies to interact with
Java Accessibility APIs of the Java SE platform. To have any effect, the
assistive technology must support the Java Access Bridge.
This command creates or updates a file named
.accessibility.properties
, in the user's home directory.
When selecting the
-enable
option, the file is populated
with the information needed to load the Java Access Bridge. This file is
then read and used in accordance with the specification of the Java SE
java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit()
API, on initialization.
Note: This command is only provided with JDK for Windows.
