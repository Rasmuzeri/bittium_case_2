Transports
A Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA)
Transport
is a
method of communication between a debugger and the virtual machine that
is being debugged (the
target VM
). The communication is
connection oriented—one side acts as a server, listening for a
connection; the other side acts as a client and connects to the server.
JPDA allows either the debugger application or the target VM to act as
the server. Transport implementations can allow communications between
processes running on a single machine, on different machines, or either.
When establishing a connection a
transport address
is used to
identify the endpoint of the connection. The format of a transport
address depends on the type of transport.
Within JPDA, the debugger application uses the Java Debug Interface
(JDI) interface and the
Connector
abstraction to establish
a connection to the target VM. See the section
Connectors
. The
Connector
used by
the debugger application encapsulates the transport. On the target VM,
an agent supporting the Java Debug Wire Protocol is used to communicate
with the debugger. This agent (which may be built into the target VM or
loaded from a runtime library) encapsulates the transport to communicate
with the debugger.
Two transport implementations are shipped with the reference
implementation: A socket transport based on TCP/IP and a shared memory
transport. The specifications do not require any specific transport
implementation to exist. In addition to transports provided with the
implementation, the architecture includes service provider interfaces to
allow additional transports be developed and deployed. See the section
Service Provider
Interfaces
.
Socket Transport
The JPDA reference implementation provides a socket transport for the
Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows platforms. With the socket
transport, the debugger application and the target VM can reside either
on the same machine or on different machines. The socket transport uses
a single stream TCP/IP connection between the debugger application and
the target VM. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported on the JDI side and the
target VM side of the socket transport.
Command and reply packets are written to the stream in accordance
with the
JDWP specification
using
the
JDWP Transport Interface
.
Because many small packets can be sent over JDWP, the TCP_NO_DELAY
socket option can improve performance in some socket implementations by
avoiding delays that could occur if the socket implementation buffers
small packets before sending them. Sockets are closed gracefully so that
unsent data is sent if possible.
The socket transport is identified through a unique string,
dt_socket
. This name can be used to select the socket
transport when invoking the target VM. See the section
VM Invocation Options
. Within the
debugger application a corresponding
Connector
is used
which encapsulates the socket transport.
Socket transport addresses have the format
<host>:<port>
where
<host>
is the host name or the IP address (may be enclosed in square brackets)
and
<port>
is the socket port number to attach to or
listen on. If
<host>
is empty, the local loopback
address is used. If
<host>
equals "
*
" in
contexts where a server is waiting for a client to attach, the server
listens on all network interfaces.
Shared Memory Transport
In addition to the socket transport, the JPDA reference
implementation provides a shared memory transport on Windows. The shared
memory transport uses a shared memory region to exchange JDWP packets
between the debugger application and the target VM. With the shared
memory transport, the debugger application and target VM must reside on
the same machine.
The shared memory transport is identified through a unique string,
dt_shmem
. This name can be used to select the socket
transport when invoking the target VM. See the section
VM Invocation Options
. Within the
debugger application, a corresponding
Connector
is used
which encapsulates the shared memory transport.
Shared memory transport addresses are simply names that can be used
as Windows file-mapping object names. The name string can consist of any
combination of characters, excluding the backslash.
Connectors
A
connector
is a JDI abstraction that is used in
establishing a connection between a debugger application (written to the
JDI) and a target VM. Different JDI implementations are free to provide
different connector implementations to match the transports and VMs they
support. The connector interfaces are very general, which allows JDI to
be used with varying connector implementations. Connectors are
configured through a set of name-value pairs. Specific connectors accept
different name-value pairs.
A good JDI client application allows users to choose and configure
any connector that may be present, but it can be beneficial to
incorporate knowledge of specific connectors into the debugger to make
their configuration a more pleasant user experience. The example JDB
implementation provided with the JPDA illustrates this approach. See the
section
Connecting with JDB
.
The JDI reference implementations provides several connectors that
map to the available transport types and the modes of connection
(launching, listening, and attaching). These connectors are described in
the following sections. A
List
containing these connectors
is returned by the JDI method
VirtualMachineManager.allConnectors()
. In addition, each
attaching, listening, and launching connector is contained in the lists
returned by the corresponding
VirtualMachineManager
methods
attachingConnectors()
,
listeningConnectors()
,
and
launchingConnectors()
.
Command-Line Launching
Connector
A debugger application can use this connector to launch any VM that
supports the same invocation debugging options as described in the
section
VM Invocation Options
. The
details of launching the VM and specifying the necessary debug options
are handled by the connector. The underlying transport used by this
connector depends on the platform. On Windows, the shared memory
transport is used. On Linux and macOS, the socket transport is used.

VM Invocation Options
This section describes the options required to invoke a VM for
debugging.
Oracle's VM implementation requires command-line options to load the
JDWP agent for debugging. The
-agentlib:jdwp
option is used
to load and specify options to the JDWP agent.
The
-agentlib:jdwp
option is specified as follows:
-agentlib:jdwp=
<suboptions>
Loads the JPDA reference implementation of JDWP. This library resides in
the target VM and uses the Java Virtual Machine Tool Interface (JVM TI)
and Java Native Interface (JNI) to interact with it. It uses a transport
and the JDWP protocol to communicate with a separate debugger
application. The section
-agentlib:jdwp and
-Xrunjdwp Suboptions
describes specific suboptions.
-agentlib:jdwp
and -Xrunjdwp Suboptions
The
-agentlib:jdwp
and
-Xrunjdwp
options
can be further qualified with suboptions. The suboptions are specified
as follows:
-agentlib:jdwp=<name1>[=<value1>],<name2>[=<value2>]...

or

    -Xrunjdwp:<name1>[=<value1>],<name2>[=<value2>]...
The following table describes the options that can be used:
-Xrunjdwp Suboptions
Name
Required?
Default Value
Description
help
no
N/A
Prints a brief help message and exits the VM.
transport
yes
none
Name of the transport to use in connecting to debugger application.
server
no
"n"
If "y", listen for a debugger application to attach; otherwise,
attach to the debugger application at the specified address.
If "y" and no address is specified, choose a transport address at
which to listen for a debugger application, and print the address to the
standard output stream. See the section
Transports
.
address
yes, if
server=n
no, otherwise
""
Transport address for the connection. If
server=n
, attempt
to attach to debugger application at this address. If
server=y
, listen for a connection at this address. See the
section
Transports
.
timeout
no
""
If
server=y
, specifies the timeout, in milliseconds, to
wait for the debugger to attach. If
server=n
specifies the
timeout, in milliseconds, to use when attaching to the debugger. Note
that the timeout option may be ignored by some transport
implementations.
launch
no
none
At completion of JDWP initialization, launch the process given in
this string. This option is used in combination with
onthrow
and/or
onuncaught
to provide
"Just-In-Time debugging" in which a debugger process is launched when a
particular event occurs in this VM.
Note that the launched process is not started in its own window. In
most cases the launched process should be a small application which in
turns launches the debugger application in its own window.
The following strings are appended to the string given in this
argument (space-delimited). They can aid the launched debugger in
establishing a connection with this VM. The resulting string is
executed.
The value of the
transport
suboption.
The value of the
address
suboption (or the generated
address if one is not given)
onthrow
no
none
Delay initialization of the JDWP library until an exception of the given
class is thrown in this VM. The exception class name must be
package-qualified. Connection establishment is included in JDWP
initialization, so it will not begin until the exception is thrown.
onuncaught
no
"n"
If "y", delay initialization of the JDWP library until an uncaught
exception is thrown in this VM. Connection establishment is included in
JDWP initialization, so it will not begin until the exception is thrown.
See the JDI specification for
com.sun.jdi.ExceptionEvent
for a definition of uncaught exceptions.
suspend
no
"y"
If "y", VMStartEvent has a suspendPolicy of SUSPEND_ALL. If "n",
VMStartEvent has a suspendPolicy of SUSPEND_NONE.
includevirtualthreads
no
"n"
If "y", virtual threads are included when the debugger requests the list
of all running threads. Virtual threads created before attaching to the
debugger may not be included. If the number of virtual threads is very
large, this can overwhelm the debugger. If "y", also causes the JDWP
library to remember all created virtual threads until their death, which
can overwhelm the JDWP library if the number is large.
Additionally dt_socket transport supports the following option:
allow
no
"*"
If server=y, allows connections only from the addresses/subnets
specified.
The value may be either "*" (which allows connections from any
address), or a list of addresses separated by the plus (
+
)
sign.
Each entry in the list can be:
A single IP address (for example, 127.0.0.1 or ::1).
A group of addresses (subnet) defined by subnet address and
prefix length (for example, 192.168.1.0/24 defines address range
192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255).
For IPv4, the prefix length must be in range 1..31; for IPv6, the
range is 1..127.
Examples
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=8000
Listen for a socket connection on port 8000 at the loopback address
only. Suspend this VM before main class loads (
suspend=y
by
default). Once the debugger application connects, it can send a JDWP
command to resume the VM.
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=*:8000,allow=192.168.1.0/24+::1,timeout=5000
Listen for a socket connection on port 8000 on all network interfaces.
Allow the debugger to connect only from addresses 192.168.1.00 -
192.168.1.255 and from the local machine by IPv6 address (::1).
Terminate if the debugger does not attach within 5 seconds. Suspend this
VM before main class loads (
suspend=y
by default). Once the
debugger application connects, it can send a JDWP command to resume the
VM.
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_shmem,server=y,suspend=n
Choose an available shared memory transport address and print it to
stdout. Listen for a shared memory connection at that address. Allow the
VM to begin executing before the debugger application attaches.
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=myhost:8000
Attach to a running debugger application via socket on host myhost on
port 8000. Suspend this VM before the main class loads.
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_shmem,address=mysharedmemory
Attach to a running debugger application via shared memory at transport
address
mysharedmemory
. Suspend this VM before the main
class loads.
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=192.168.1.18:8000,allow=*,onthrow=java.io.IOException,launch=/usr/local/bin/debugstub
Wait for an instance of
java.io.IOException
to be thrown in
this VM. Suspend the VM (
suspend=y
by default). Listen for
a socket connection at address 192.168.1.18 on port 8000. Allow the
debugger to connect from any address. Execute the following:
"
/usr/local/bin/debugstub dt_socket myhost:8000".
This
program can launch a debugger process in a separate window which will
attach to this VM and begin debugging it.
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_shmem,server=y,onuncaught=y,launch=d:\bin\debugstub.exe
Wait for an uncaught exception to be thrown in this VM. Suspend the VM.
Select a shared memory transport address and listen for a connection at
that address. Execute the following:
"
d:\bin\debugstub.exe dt_shmem <address>"
, where
<address>
is the selected shared memory address. This
program can launch a debugger process in a separate window which will
attach to this VM and begin debugging it.
Connecting with JDB
The example implementation of the Java Debugger (JDB) provided with
the JPDA, provides an illustration of the usage of JDI connectors. There
are "shortcut" options to JDB which assume the use of connectors known
to it (that is, connectors present in the reference implementation). It
also provides a way to establish a general connection using any
connector. While JDB is hardly an example of a good debugger interface,
it does provide a simple example of connectors in use.
In JDB, the
-attach
option provides access to one of the
attaching connectors in the reference implementation (shared memory on
Windows, sockets on Linux and macOS). The
-listen
option
provides access to one of the listening connectors in the reference
implementation (shared memory on Windows, sockets on Linux and macOS). A
class name and arguments specified directly on the command line provide
access to the command line launching connector.
For example:
jdb -attach myhost:8000
is an easy way to attach to a target VM with the socket attaching
connector (on Linux on macOS), and
jdb Hello 1 2 3
is an easy way to launch a target VM with the command-line launching
connector.
However, the
-connect
option is also provided by JDB to
handle any connector by taking an connector name and a set of arbitrary
name-value argument pairs. For example, the previous command lines have
the following equivalents:
jdb -connect com.sun.jdi.SocketAttach:hostname=myhost,port=8000
jdb -connect "com.sun.jdi.CommandLineLaunch:main=Hello 1 2 3"
These command lines are more cumbersome than the ones above, but the
-connect
option can be used with any connector. This kind
of operation is a primitive example of how a JDI debugger can deal with
any kind of connector while providing a simplified interface for dealing
with common, well-known connectors.
Service Provider Interfaces
JPDA includes service provider interfaces to allow the development
and deployment of connector and transport implementations. These service
provider interfaces allow debugger and other tool vendors to develop new
connector implementations and provide addition transport mechanisms over
and beyond the socket and shared memory transport provided by Oracle.
The service provider interfaces in JDI are specified in the
com.sun.jdi.connect.spi
package.
In addition to the service provider interfaces in JDI, the Oracle
implementation also includes a transport library interface called the
Java Debug Wire Protocol Transport
Interface
. A transport library is loaded by the JDWP agent in the
target VM and is used to establish a connection to the debugger and to
transport JDWP packets between the debugger and the VM.

Java Platform Debugger Architecture -
Service Provider Interfaces
