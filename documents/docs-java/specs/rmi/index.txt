Remote Method Invocation Specification
Java Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI) is a distributed object
model for the Java programming language that retains the semantics of
the Java platform's object model, making distributed objects easy to
implement and to use. The system combines aspects of the Modula-3
Network Objects system and Spring's subcontract and includes some novel
features made possible by the Java SE platform.
